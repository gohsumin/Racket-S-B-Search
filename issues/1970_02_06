Grinnell Freshmen Are
Rated in National Survey

The freshmen who entered
Grinnell College last fall were
more talented, more affluent,
and more “liberal” than the
average college freshman, Those
are the results of a survey of
college freshmen conducted last
fall by the American Council on
Education. 343 Grinnell students
completed questionnaires There
were 390 students in the entering
class Here are some 01 the find
ings of the survey

74 per cent ot Grinnell s fresh
men had 13- -plus or better grade
averages in high school. Just
over 36 per cent of all entering
college freshmen in the sample
had such records. 61 per cent of
Grinnell’s freshmen were in the
upper in per cent of their high
school classes. Just under 31 per
cent of the national sample fit
into this category. 24 per cent
of the nation’s freshmen were in
the second quarter of their high
school classes; only 9 per Cent
at Grinnell.

One quarter of those surveyed
at Grinnell had edited their high
school newspaper. 12 per cent of
the national sample had done so.
Almost 36 per cent had ”had
some original writing
published," This is twice the
national average. 3 times as
many Grinnell freshmen had
competed in a state or regional
speech contest. Only 24 per cent
had received a varsity letter in

Irwin and Pahnke Speak

Campus Holds Drug Symposium

Featuring lectures, films,
discussions, and class par-
ticipation by three experts,
Grinnell's drug symposium was
held Wednesday and Thursday,
Februaryiandsat the college,

Dr. Samuel Irwin, phar-
macologist, began the program
early with a KDIC interview
Tuesday afternoon. He continued
his introduction to the Grinnell
scene that night by participating
in an informal session with
students in the Loose RA Suite
andlater by speaking to a special
meeting oftheRAs.

Dr, Irwin attended classes
Wednesday morning in
Chemistry and Psychology, and
he opened the formal
programming in the afternoon
with a speech entitled,
“Physiological and Behavioral
Effects of Psychoactive Drugs.”
Dr. Irwin is a research Scientist
who has explored porblems in
analgesia, anesthesia, drug
addiction, memory, and social
behavior, but his interests are
farranging, as his meetings
with students proved.

Dr. Irwin’s speech began with
a double-barrel attack on drug
users and the establishment. He
charged the former with un-
derstating the dangers of drug
use and the latter with bias in
stamping out drug use. He states
that nothing we do is without
risk; therefore, it is establishing
relative risks which is important.

On this baSis. according to Dr.

Irwin, alcohol is the most
dangerous drug we possess.
Alcohol is involved in 60 per Cent
of all Violent crimes, 60 per cent
of all traffic fatalities, and 50 per
centof all law enforcement work.
On his chart which rates drugs
according to their intrinsic
hazard potential to society he
lists alcohol as a 100 per cent
ratio; speed, 90 per cent; heroin,
40 per cent; pot, 20 per cent, and
LSD-25.15 per cent.

Dr. lrwin makes a strong
distinction between drug use and
drug abuse, Having made this
distinction, he says, “Drug use
is no problem.” In reference to
pot use, he asserts, “It‘s a shame
to deprive people oi these ex-
periences.” l-le continues,“1n the
times we live in we need drugs,
or else we’d have a lot mure
suicides.”

A drug has no meaning apart
from the dose taken," according
to the scientist. Pot is extremely
safe in low‘dosages, but at six
times the normal dosage it his
duces more bad trips than LSD.
This is the basic problem with
the blackemarket drugs. says Dr.
Irwin, that one can never be sure
of the dosage. He refers to black-
markel drug use as “playing
“Russian roulette.”

in reference to drug laws, Dr.
lrwin asserts, “They cause
problems, they don’t solve any.”
He believes enough research has
been done on grass to justify its
legalization.

Dr._ lrwin discussed problems of drug use and abuse, as well as
legislative and political problems involving drugs, after his ar-

rival on campus last Wednesday.

solo.

However, he opposes chronic
drug use among students and
tries to suggest alternative ways
of broadening experience, Highly
concerned politically, he sums up
his drug philosophy this way:
“Don’t get hung up on drugs, be
activists."

Dr. Walter N. Pahnke, whose
field ranges from the psychology
oi religion to LSD psychotherapy,
made his debut on campus
Wednesday afternoon when he
introduced and answered
questions on the film, “The
Spring Grove Experiment,”
which explores a project with
which Dr. Pahnke is very much
involved at the present time.

in the evening, Dr. Pahnke
delivered his formal address,
entitled “Religion, Mysticism,
and Psychoactive Drugs,” in
which he compared spontaneous
mystical experiences to drug-
aided psychedelic experiences,
finding in many instances a very
great similarity between the two
phenomena.

Dr. Pahnke established nine
categories for describing a
mystical experience: unity,
transcendence, emntiunal mood,
the “knowetic't quality, a sense
of sacredness, alleged inef-
ability, paradoxical images,
transiency, and long—lasting
changes in attitude and behavior.

Dr. Pahnke did research with
two different groups of people
using psychedelic drugs to
determine how often they had a
mystical experience which
closely resembled the spon-
taneous experience. He found in
the first group that 70 per cent
had a mystic experience. and in

'the second group the incidence

was 35 per cent, Thus the results
were very positive.

Dr, Pahrike believes that an
acid trip is not for everyone;
“LSD is a powerful tool and can
be dangerous,” a “freak-out” is
a very real possibility, he warns.
As for pot, he believes that more
research is needed: but in the
meantime, “All penalties should
be removed, I’m upset about
what the laws do, I‘m opposed
tocriminalization.”

Dr, Pahnke ended his Speech
by asserting, “We’ve got to steer
a middle course between the anti-
drug hysteria, which inhinits
even research and the pro-drug
abandon, which will result in
psychological damage,"

When asked about the
possibility or dealing with bad
trips, Dr. Pahnke said that it
would be very easy and very
desirable 7 “even the college
health center could do it.” He
emphasized that this service
must be conducted in an at
mospliere devoid of fear 7
especially fear of being turned
over to police.

Editorial

Alas, with the departure of two of its members,
that august governing body, the Senate, has ap-
parently lost some of its burning zeal for moral and
intellectual virtue. Last week, they deigned to do
nothing more monumental than appropriate $300
for the establishment of a coffee-house. Recalling
their past history of unflagging service to needy
causes, one would have expected them, at least, to
have found it in their hearts, and in our pocket-
books, to 'assist ex-student Larry Frank in his pros-
ecution of Mr. Bowers.

Let us recall the appropriations made by the
Senate for the Pterodactyl last year. One wonders
whether the Senate would have been so eager to
subsidize an independent publication if, say, that
publication were a journal of right-wing opinion,
We recall the oration of one Senator last term on
the political virtues of his dog. Perhaps he had in
mind the fact that the Emperor Caligula saw fit to
make his horse a Roman Senator, It is hard to tell.

Few people realize that there are no apparent
laws which regulate Senate expenditures. This fact
was confirmed by President Leggett, Dean Walker,
and Andy Brill, Chairman af the Senate Finance
Committee. As a result, the Senate can do as it
pleases with our money. It can, say, use a part of
everyone’s money to send a few people to the
moratorium in Washington. Or, indicative of its ex-
pansive humaneness, it can appropriate money for
the construction of a dog house. Or again, it can al-
locate funds for the legal defense of demonstrators.

Lest anyone think that we are speaking of only
a few stray dollars, consider this: last semester, the
Senate had approximately $26,000 to spend as it
chose. The figure for this semester is slightly more
than $25,300. This means that the Senate’s open
checking-account contains more than $50,000 a year.
It is true that a large share of this money is sup-
posed to go to the Social Coordinating Committee.
Even in this case, however, the Senate has the
power to considerably reduce this sum. Perhaps it
will, if and when Pterodactyl comes-a-begging.

We are chary of pointing out the legal impli-
cations of this situation, for legality, as we all know,
is a minor consideration. In virtue of the Senate‘s
contributions to Pterodactyl, the college is eminent-
ly vulnerable to lawsuits by students who can claim
that their money was put to use outside of the
college‘s jurisdiction.

Although you might simply like to ignore the
Senate, that would be like ignoring a man who is
ransacking your house. We suggest that President
Leggett appoint a committee of students to create
legal principles for the appropriation of student
funds in order that the majorit. of students be pro-
tected from the capricious activities of a few.

It remains to be seen what sage resolutions and
bold appropriations the Senate will make this se-
mester. Eventually, one would hope that the stu‘
dent body will realize that the children in the
Senate do not need a $50,000 toy.

Letters to the Editor . . .

Dear Sirs:

So the misuse of language is
dangerous to the sold, is it? i
kind oi wondered how you could
keep up the pace of sententious
pomposity set in your iirst
editorial, so i histed up my
galluses and read all the way
through the second one. The
effort was not unrewarding.
Heavyrhanded under-graduate
humor! now precious! “Arsenic
dialectic and frenetic
manipulation of previously en-
slaved Grinnell womanhood. . ."
You must have wowed them in
high school. You see, the bare
ability to parse a sentence is no
guarantee of virtue, or even of
robust common sense.

Line of the most consistent
tactics of the Schlemiel in the
public forum, for as long as i
can remember, has been the
equation oi pressing issues with
absurd [rifles of his own devising.
I am glad, sirs, GLAD. that you
can recognize a woman, in
public, even from behind, but it
has nothing to do with the
liberation of women that you can.
I will not attempt, here and now,
a man-to-man explanation of the
whys and wherefores of women's
lib., as there are many and ample
resources of information
available; should you really want
to know something. Allow me,
then, to address myscli scriatim.
to a couple oi the points men-
tioned in the above mentioned
editorial.

Oh, where to begin‘I", . .one
of the most “relevant" campus
issues. , Now why those quotes,
kids? You think, perhaps, that
something is wrong With the
word71t's a line word, you know;
latin root and everything.

I will overlook the Second,
third, and fourth paragraphs oi
the editorial. i must confess a
personal distaste for cheap sar-
casm, so perhaps 1 should
reserve comment until I can find

someone around here who likes
that kind of humor, In fairness,
all sides Should be heard.

Now about that big last
paragraph, Do you wish to
suggest that the main thrust oi
women‘s liberation is the
elimination of women as such?
What is a woman, dear editors?
You have quoted one liberated
woman's coniession that “some
of our ideas” run counter to her
nature. Which ideas? Eager as
you are to smile the heretics, try
not to be obtuse. Again, what is
a womani The only physical or
intellectual distinction that you
make or simply imply between
woman and man is that, when
all is as it should be, men lift
weights and women do not, Do
you lift weights? Do you wear
your jock a lot’! Perhaps a
“modern high school course in
sex education”wuuldbein orderr

I would advise that, in the
iuiure, you avoid humorous
editorials, You are not competent
in the genre. I would advise,
further, that you remember that
what you are working on is a

Historians Discuss
Black Studies

At the recent meeting of the
American Historical Association
in Washington two black scholars
raised the question of the value
of black studies programs.

John w. Blassingame,
assistant professor oi history at
the University oi Maryland, who
presented a “model" program in
AfroVAmerican studies, said such
programs were the “best way for
American colleges to add another
dimension to the liberally
educated man who has to live
in a multiracial society.”

In opposition to this view,
Andi-e55 Taylor, associate dean
of community education at
Federal City College, charac-
terized black studies programs
at predominantly white
universities as “attempts to co-
opt the drive that is coming out
of the black community."

Mr. Taylor further added that
most black teachers in the past
had been “racial traitors," and
that the “role of the black in
tellectual needs to be redefined. "

Mr. Elassingame argued that,
“It is important that American
college students be given an
opportunity to study a group
which has iormed so large a part
oi the population oi the United

*smies throughout its history,”

“The diversity and complexity
of American society can be
illuminated by studying its long
history of intolerance, the
reciprocal relationship between
the black subculture and
America’s dominant western
culture, and the unique historical
and contemporary position of
Negroes in American political,
economic, social, intellectual,
cultural, and artistic life.”

Mr Blassingam’e said that a

ON THE RIGHT

by WiIIiam F. Buckley, Jr.

The sun having entered Aquarr
ius, the Chinese New Year cannot
be far away. In fact, the date
is February 6. Better known, in
this part of the world, as Tet.

What will the enemy do? For
symbolic reasons, there is great
call on them to do something. The
great Tet offensive of 1968 had
profound political consequences
in America. It is (I believe) iris
conceivable that Eugene Mc-
Carthy would have done so well
in the New Hampshire presided
tial primary but for the general
despair about Vietnam generated
by that kamikaze assault on
American installations and South
Vietnamese cities. We know now
that it was a military disaster
for the enemy, but it looked for
a great, while as though it would
be worth it to them in poliucal
tender, which is the tender they
have mostly dealt in throughout
the course of the bloody war.

The Mekong Delta is the like»
liest area because it was there
that the war, in fact, began, in
part because the enemy coveted
the great rice bowl of the region.
It is useful to remember the
figure that as per cent of Vietnam
is in friendly hands, and that 35
per cent of the area that isn't
in friendly hands lies within the
Mekong Delta to which, however,
the enemy has had for the first
time to send North Vietnamese
regulars because their efforts
there can no longer be sustained
by indigenous revolutionaries.
This causes special problem
because of a historical antipathy
by southerners to the Prussians
from above the 17th parallel.
Still, it remains the likeliest place
for the assault.

It may be that the North
Vietnamese haven’t the military
energy to do something spectac
ular this time around; or it may
be that they Will decide to await
a more propitious season,
perhaps in the spring or early
summer. On the other hand, one
must prepare oneself, and it is
surely important to consider now
what possibly the enemy could
achieve, say in the Mekong Delta
where it continues to be stronger
than in the northern regions.

The answer, of course is that
over a short but melodramatic
period, a Very few people can
achieve a great deal, almost any
where. The analogy is strained
but useful, mat if the Black Stu-
dents Union can occupy Cornell
University, the Viet Cong can
probably take 2 ate town. or

even a small city, if it chooses
a) to concentrate its power in a
particular area, and b) to assign
soldiers to a suicidal mission.

As ever, the enemy would have
in mind a political rather than
a military objective. The goal
wouldn't be to hold down for a
few days or a week a few towns
and villages, but to suggest to
the world that Vietnamization is
a hallucination and that the mili
tary reserves of the enemy are
infinite.

It would appear to me obvious
that one should anticipate ﬂash
successes by the enemy in the
next weeks or months. The
military effect of them should be
calibrated, and will be. Their
political success should be
studied much more intensely.
Germany never seemed so strong
as during the winter offensive it
waged in December of 1944, and
the great Battle of the Bulge is
said to have prompted even Gen-
eral Patton to muse at a dramatic
meeting of Allied generals diat
the Germans might yet win the
war. Ninety days later. Hitler
had committed suicide,

General Giap is not likely to
commit suicide, although it is not
inconceivable that he will be shot,
even as some of his predecessors
were executed for miscalcur
lations. The General believes that
he knows America, and he has
every reason to excuse the
military casualties he suffered
two years ago at Tet on the
grounds that he came close to
paralyzing the American will.
Mr. Nixon, confident that the
stamina was there, gradually
roused it, and today it carries
us forward, towards Vietnamizas
tion towards an objective which
can truly be called national.

Can we be unbalanced again
by anything that is within the
power of the North Vietnamese
to do? It is a subject of much
political speculation.

The opponents of the Vietnam
war and, derivatively, of the
policy of Vietnamization, are
strangely quiet these days, as if
the conccrtmaster had taken a
leave of absence. They gorge on
bad news from’Vietnam (nothing
brightens their day so much as,
say, news of high American
casualty figures). But like the
VictCong, they are still capable
of spasmodic efforts which, even
like a dying battery, can make
great light, even if it is a terminal
effort,

For the past ten years at Ann
tioch College I have been able
to see something of the in-
teractions of young people with
educators and thus to form a very
tentative analysis of the sources
of adolescent unrest.

Over the years i have noticed
the evolution of three distinct
kinds of restless student
behavior. The first might be
translated into a statement: “I
am here." The second might be
characterized as a demand:
“Join my ideology.” The third
might be a request: “Help me
develop a new corporate struc-
tui‘e.H

An early experience with “I am
here” behavior came when we
had just begun , to discuss
modifying parietal rules — rules
about the way in which men and
women live together. i came in
one morning at a reasonable
hour»say nine o’clock and saw a'
girl and a boy in a sleeping bag
on the campus in full view of the
morning traffic. They even
created considerable disturb-

ance. when I talked with the
two students, it seemed clear to

me they were saying that, despite
parietal rules, they were
behaving Within existing com-
munity morels. This they wanted
acknowledged, not because they
were organizing an assualt on
pariental rules. but for very
personal reasons.

Similar behavior manifested
itself in the organization of semis
public nude swimming parties,
and when drugs first appeared,
in the aggressive public use of
pot, I remember a couple of
students who came to see me.
They were quite stoned. They
came to ask me, they said, what
i would do if students did come
andtellmetheyweiestczied,

The Antioch Community has
tried to deal with ideological
questions in a fashion that
enriches its ideological
pluralism. The effect has been
a steady reduction of negative
sanctions against particular
political and soctal behavior.

in the end new structures may
well be inevitable because youth
themselves, I sense, are in-
creasingly taking charge of
building the new structures.
while we are busy describing

A WORD EDGEWISE

by John P. Roche

The conservative justification
for isolationism lS coldly realistic
7 the United States In its con-
linental fortress can manage
very nicely no matter what
happens at most places in the
world. The liberal rationale,
while it comcs out roughly in the
same place, is quite different,
resting on a curious amalgam of
paleISm, anti»impcrialism, and
anti-capitalism.

Here is the central theme:
“The destiny of Europe and Asia
has not been committed, under
God, to the keeping of the United
States; and only conceit, dreams
of grandeur, vain imagiiiings,
lust for power, or a desire to
escape from our domestic perils
and obligations couldpossibly
make us suppose that Providence
has appointed us his chosen
people for the pacification of the
earth "

it has a familiar ring. it could
be Senator Eugene McCarthy or
Professor Henry Steele Com-
mager discussing Vietnam at a
hearing of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee. It could be
a resolution by Americans for
Democratic Action or an editorial
in'the Christian Century. It is,
in fact, an excerpt from Charles
A, Board's “Giddy Minds and
Foreign Quarrels” (1939).

The argument further suggests
that this arrogance will destroy
our democratic values: “If we
go in, decency, tolerance. kindiir
ness, truth, democracy and free
dam will be the first victims.”
(Norman Thomas, “Keep Amery
ica Out of War,” 1939.) in other
words, it is our mission to bring
the democratic ideal to fruition
in the United States 7 how can
we spend money to defeat South-
east Asia when there are still
poverty and discrimination at
home?

The appealing reality of
modern totalitarianism muffled
this liberal isolationist theme in
the first decade after World War
ii. The moralists took command
of containing Communist power,
much to the dismay of the chief
tlieoi-etician of containment,
George F, Kennan, who felt that
dealing with the Soviets was a
task for foreign service officers
and other gentlemen, not for im»
passioned crusaders. What
emerged was an alliance between
those who thought that checking
Communist power was a vital

American interest (conservar
tlves,) and others who believed
that the United States had a
moral obligation to oppose totali-
tarianism (libel-315.) This
inherently schizophrenic coalis
tion limped along through the 505,
but disintegrated under the
impact of Vietnam. The young
generation, which has never seen
at first hand the enormities of
totalitarianism, simply defected.
Ironically, Without knowing, it,
they went right back to the
positions that those of us who
opposed World War it had aban-
donedinDecember,1941‘.

There is nothing wicked about
this rejection of moralism (“the
tired cliches of the Cold War,"
etc), but, as 1 pointed out in an
earlier column. if one extracts
moralism as a component of
foreign policy, the conservative
isolationist position is impreg-
nable. What, for example. can a
rational analyst of national in-
terest make of a President who
would say “What do you do when
little lsrael calls on you for assis
tance and help? I’ll tell you what
you do. You do what is right .

. You stand up for freedom,
whatever the price”? Or of a ‘
President who announces that we
are the “watchmen on the walls
of world freedom”? Obviously
these men 7 Lyndon I3. Johnson
and John F. Kennedy 7 were
intoxicated by power.

Under the new realism, then,
a united front of conservatives
and liberals has spurned morale
ism, It turns up everywhere.
Clayton Fritchey, for example,
writes in his column: “It may
be that the United States should
not be in the Middle East at all,
but as long as it is, it has a stake
in Israel’s security.” Freedom,
in short, has become subject to
cost accounting.

1 would be the last person to
deny that moralism can get us
into trouble, or — on the other
hand — to defend indiscriminate
and nonrprudential efforts to
liberate the world. But I am
convinced that a United States
dedicated to isolation and af-
ﬂuence while most of the world
degenerated into squalor and
totalitarianiasm, would be a
moral monstrosity. Perhaps this
is arrogance, though I suspect it
is what the prophet means when
he Said, "where there is no vision,
the people perish.”

The Nature of a Liberal Education: Part I

by it. c. Apostle

One of the greatest difficulties
in solving a problem, whether it
relates to knowledge or to value
or to action, is a clear and
adequate understanding of the
principles involved. in a science,
without a clear and adequate
knowledge or the principles,
demonstration and richness of
theorems become difficult; in
politics and ethics, without clear
and adequate knowledge of the
ultimate values and the princis
pies in their understanding,
discussion becomes aimless and
even verbal; in action, without
the necessary proper habits,
along with the required knowl-
edge to direct them, a worthy
goal is not easily attained, Our
main concern is the principle
upon which colleges are based,
the one which goes by the name
“Liberal Education.” In this our
first article we shall make some
preliminary remarks about
principles.

Principles are the starting-
points of things or of knowledge
or of action, and they are the
hardest to comprehend or
choose; so it is with good reason
that the ancients considered
them as worth more than half
or the whole. The principle ot a
circle is its definition, and with
out this, knowledge oi the proper
ties of a circle is almost impos-
sible, The principles oi physics
as elements are the ultimate
indefinables (matter, time,
length, and the like), and without
these, definition of the subject
matter and the properties of
physical objects become im-
possible Now, while the prin-
ciples in the natural sciences are
quite accurate, partly because
they are iew, those in the
biological sciences are less ac»
curate, for additional factors
enter into the composition of
living things, and those in the
social sciences and politics are
even more involved for the same
reason. This, however, should not
deter us irom making the best
out of the situation, for while the
value ot one subject may lie in
its accuracy, that of another may

lie in its importance, and both
are desirable. The objects of
mathematics easily lend them~
selves to accuracy, and so
mathematics proceeds to deiinite
conclusions with little hesitation.
Historically, this science was the
iii-st to advance. The objects of
sociology and politics, on the
other hand, are complicated and
vague, Some men even refuse to
colistder politics asa science; but
the political and social upheaval
of our times aild the urgency for
the solution oi such problems
testify to its importance.

Lack of clarity and of
adequacy in principles is
usually reﬂected in the ter-
minology used. in sociology and
politics contrary terms are
usually employed to signiiy
objects with contrary values,
e.g., objects which are either
good or bad, either beautiful or
ugly, either true or false. Such,
for example, are the following
contrarieties: reactionary
progressive, conservatives
liberal, static-dynamic, absolute
relative, tormal-lntuitive,
toleranteiiitolerant, equal rights;
unequal rights. The most recent
colitrariety is the one advanced
by Professor Bowman: Ardent
Lcltist-Archtypal Aristotelian;
perhaps both terms of this can»
trariety are intended to signify
something bad, with good lyi'ng
somewhere in between, One often
condemns the reactionary, or the
conservative, or the absolute, or
the static, but praises what he
considers as progresswe or
liberal or relative or dynamic;
sometimes one does the opposite,
All these terms in the social
sciences are for from being used
clearly but they are often used
without hesitation; and they are
almost as bad as slogans, Their
usageto describe others amounts
practically to name-calling We
may illustrate.

Not all absolutes are false or
bad, nor are all of them true or
good, and the same applies to
all relatives The law of cons
ti‘adicticn iS absolutely true, for
if not, it would be possible, for

example, for a man to be alive
and dead at the same time; and
it you allow the derivative of x2
to be, say, 5x as well as 2x, and
water to have no hydrogen
sometimes, you will destroy
mathematics and chemistry, or
else be prepared to flunk both,
Further, it you want to live, food
and water are absolutely
necessary, and absolutely good.
On the other hand, the contrary
of the law of contradiction is
absolutely false. Total
deprivation or food and water is
absolutely bad [or the con-
tinuation oi life. The same may
be said of relatives, for
corresponding to an absolute
there exists a relative; but we
leave this as an exercise for the
reader, Those who admit only
relatives, we may add, are taced
with a contradiction because they
will have to admit as absolutely
true the statement “no absolute
is true,” for if they do not admit
it as true, they will have to allow
some absolutes, contrary to their
position.

As for equal rights (as against
unequal rights), something which
some students are inclined to
demand in colleges and
universities, this too is vague,
unless further qualified. There is
a political right, and a property
right, and a right based on
knowledge, and other rights; and
it is encouraging to see this
distinction made in this
semester’s first 5&8 editorial.
Now when the term “right” has
been sufficiently defined or
determined in its application,
there is still the problem of
whether the parties to such a
right are equally qualified. it is
the patient’s right to choose a
doctor, but the doctor's right to
deCide 0n the kind of medicine;
it is the student's (or his
parent’s) right to decide on a
college, but the college’s right to
decide on the various college
requirements tor graduation; it
is the citizen’s right to Vote for
a candidate but Coitgress‘ right

to legislate. This does not bar

communication and discussion to
the mutual benefit of both par
ties, nor the possibility of error
on the part of the party who has
the right to decrde. In general,
then, if A and B differ in their
qualifications and enter into a
relation, decisions by A and by
B which are based on the dif-
ferences between A and B and
which are required in that
relation cannot be based on the
same kind of right. If all citizens
are given the same right to
decide without qualification,
there will be no distinction be-
tween a doctor and a patient, a
president and another citizen,
Order will give way to chaos, and
the state will cease to exist.
Exceptions to good decisions will
always exist as long as man is
not perfect; and mough the at-
tempt to approach perfection is
a virtue, the expectation of
reaching it or demanding it
betrays alack of realism. Human
affairs do not possess the per-
fection OI mathematics. One who
deals with human affairs must
expect some deviation.

Similar remarks apply to the
terms in the other contrarieties

and in general between a good
decrsions and a bad decision.
and to other such terms. Such
terms, then, cannot function as
clear principles of what is true,
good, or beautiful; for a principle
is by definition a starting point
or a criterion for judging, and
a bad beginning leads to a bad
result, An initial error of one
degree in direction by an airplane
leads to an increasing deviation
from the target.

clear and adequate definition of
a liberal education. A definition,
as stated earlier, is a principle,
and though a liberal education
is admitted to he important to
students entering colleges like
Grlnnell, there seems to be
something elusive about what
such education is. Some of the
problems facing colleges today
are due to the lack oi a clear
and explicit statement of what
they are supposed to do: to give
the students a liberal education,
of course, but what this is and

47 per cent of the Grlnnell

when the survey was taken last
September, 12 per cent of the
national sample listed no

A larger percentage of the
Grlnnell freshmen than of the
national sample thought the
followrng goals were important:
to achieve in a performing art,
to influence the political struc-
ture, to write original works, to
create Works of art. The Grinnell
freshmen were about average in
their opinion of the importance
of the following goals: .to develop
a philosophy of life, to be an
authority in a field, to have
friends different from themr
selves, and to help others in
difficulty. A smaller percentage
of the Grinnell freshmen thought
the following goals were imr
portant: to raise a family, to
have an active social life (33 per
cent at Grinnell, as per cent
nationally), to be “ad-
ministratively responsible” (9
per cent, 23 per cent), to be very
wellrofi financially, to become a
community leader, and to sue
ceed m a private business (19 per
cent,41percent).

75 per cent of the Grlnnell
freshmen classified their
political preferences as “left” or
“liberal,” 25 per cent as
“moderate,” “moderately
conservative," or “strongly
conservative." Nationally 34 per
cent of the freshmen labeled
themselves “left” or “liberal,”
and 66 per cent “moderate,”
“moderately conservative," or
“strongly conservative.” This
seems to raise an important
question: is the spectrum of
political views represented on
this campus as fully as they
should be? Another: 0n the
whole, do Students’ political
opinions really differ
significantly from those of their
parents, at this stage or ever?
Is there a ”generation gap" in
political views?

One part of the survey asked
the students to indicate the
statements with which they
”agreed strongly or somewhat ”
Some of the results: that all
scientific findings should be
published (67 per cent Grinnell,
54 per cent nationally), that the
college should control students
ofi campus (7 per cent, 20 per
cent), that the benefit of college
is monetary (16 per cent, 47 per
cent), that student publications
should be regulated (12 per cent,
51 per cent), that marijuana
should be legalized (65 per cent,
24 per cent), that'colleges are
too lax on student protest (16 per
cent, 60 per cent), that divorce
laws should be liberalized (93 per
cent, 76 per cent), that abortion
should be legalized (93 per cent,
76 per cent), that courts protect
the ciminal too much (21 per-
cent, 53 per cent.).

For those who advocate the 19-
year-old vote, there are some
interesting statistics. Only half of
the Grinnell freshmen and 23 per
cent of the national sample said
they had discussed politics in the
previous year, a national election
year. How would this compare
to the over»2l’s? Other things
they had done during the
previous year: Attended a
religious service (76 per cent, 91
per cent), argued with a teacher
in class (79 per cent, 55 per cent),
arranged a date for another
student (29 per cent, 49 per cent),
protested racial policy (as per
cent, 13 per cent), protested
us. military policy (26 per cent,
7 per cent), protested against a
high school administration (43
per cent, 25 per cent), read
poetry outside of a course (78 per
cent, 63 per cent), visited an art
gallery or museum (37 per cent,
63 per cent), discussed sports (30
per cent, 44 per cent).

Provided the results of the
survey give a reasonably ac
curate picture, they provide
some valuable information both
to the college in framing its
policies and to students in
discussing themselves and the
college. It would be interesting
to compare this to surveys of
other freshmen classes that have
entered Grinnell and to See
whether and how these students
change during the next four
years. We might also raise the
question: Is the Grinnell student
body sufficiently diverse to
provide the best education for
each of its members?

Senate Appoints New Committee
Bureaucratic Octopus Flourishes

by Tom Greenﬁeld

Greg Vranicar launched a
thirty minute hoopla about
student power last Tuesday when
he denied the much accepted
notion that the student power
push of last semester had died
with Steve Schwartz’s grade
point. While perceptively
acknowledging that students
seemed apathetic toward the
student power issue, (why should
this issue be different?) he forces
fully asserted his own interest
inthe student steering committee
negotiations, and requested that
the Senate find out what has been
happening in the meetings, Andy
Loewi and Phil Mears defended
the closed meeting of the steering
committee and Mr. Betts’ faculty
committee. (“They have been
hacking out things for quite a
while and it Will waste time to
go back and explain things over
and over again to new people
sitting in.”) However, the Senate
decided to assign Jim Lew and
Frank Thomas to attend the
meetings and report back to the
Senate.

The student power discussion
grew out of a Senate report on
its recent dinner With President
Leggett. At the dinner, Dr.
Leggett announced to the Senate
that Dean Kimbo will take over
as Dean of Students next year.
The Senate announced to Dr.
Leggett that they were ”ticked”
at the administration for not
allowmg students to participate
in the selection of Mrs. Low’s
replacement. When Dr. Leggett
assured the senators that the
students would participate in the
selection of the assistant dean,
the students stated that they were
not'sure that they even wanted
an assistant dean per se. Con~
sidering the fact that Saga was
serving chicken and mushroom
sauce that night, one can only
surmise that it was a fairly
depressing dinner all the way
around.

In response to the procedure
of Dean Kimbo’s selection, (The
Senate was careful to note that
they were raising no objections
to Mr. Kimbo personally or
professionally) the Senate issued
an “offical protest” on the matter

and urged the students on the
student affairs committee to
start working on a system which
would allow students to par
ticipate in the “decision
making process“ of the Dean's
Office.

Andy Brill announced that he
is looking for a poobplaying
biologist With a knowledge of
lewd stories and Hebrew to fill
a vacancy on the finance cunb
mittee. The position is open to
allstudents.

In a surprise move, Frank
Thomas announced that as of 3: 00
yesterday, no posters could be
placed on the library walls or
doorways Without Mr. Alden's
approval. Although Frank in-
sisted that the.rationale for this
rule was that posters harm the
“aestheticbeautyofthelibrary,”
nobody believedhim.

Moving from the ridiculous to
the sublime, Frank called on

students to register their ar-
ticulate gripes about the foreign

language requirement with his
office, so the SGA can “do
something about it." (the Crowd
roared.) Further discussion led
to a motion to take an already
established committee of
students concerned with the
problem and make them (drum
roll) AN OFFICIAL COMV
MITTEE OF THE STUDENT
SENATE WITH ALL THE OF-
FICIAL POWERS AND
PRIVILEGES AND PRESTIGE.

Drunk with its own power, the
Senate took the student com-
mittees on grades, residents
halls, freshman curriculum, and
counseling and rendered them all
official committee of the Senate

Jayne West then proposed that
the Senate create three new
committees, thereby bringing the
total to 1649. Jayne said that this
figure represented a new ACM
record and that the money gained
from this prestige would help
defray the cost of the Physical
Education complex. Alter ap-
proving a committee on
residence halls, health center,
and (get this) the student hand-
book, everybody went home.

na, Swarthmore, and Oberlin,
Grinnell is presented as a socially
liberal, politically active, and
academically ﬂexible institution
whose primary goal is the
development of the proverbial
“wellsrounded personality.”
Students who are “eager to test
their ideas" are encouraged to
come. The ideals of change,
growth, and (almost) enlighten
ment are suggested. And over
and over again the necessity for
“involvement" in the social and
academic environment of the
College is stressed. Grinnell
College in the eyes of a potential
student must seem an attractive
challenge.

The many remarkably un-
staged episodes of the movie
exhibit most aspects of college
life. Classes, of course. get their
share oftilm coverage. The many
scenes of Central Campus and the
Forum suggest a friendly and
relaxed atmosphere. Music,
dance, and art serve to em-
phasize the creative element of
education, Dormitory existence
is embodied in lounge parties and
cozy bedroom chats. By pres
senting a section on student
government, the film introduces

the concept of student respon-
sibility in dectsion making.
“Drugs, free sex, and drinking”
become symbols oi a new and
unexplored world of personal
freedoms to be found on the Grin-

E, King represent the tormal
social activity of the college. Two
surprises arise in the film. First,
the shots of the lowa countryside
are amazingly attractive, and
second. Grinnell’s relatively
small athletic department
becomes an asset to the college’s
scholastic reputation, Even the
problems of civil rights, racism,
radicalism, and student unrest
are touched upon. No one could
accuse this film of not showing
the view of almost every type
of usual college activity.

Mr. Turner would tell a group

is not a clever semanticist and
would never risk employing tact

as far as any public relations film
could ever be honest or accurate,
this film is both. The benefits of
the smallness of the school are
voiced repeatedly. Even the
advantages of being located in
Iowa receive much attention.
However, there are some things
missing, There are no “freaks,"
there are no unbeautilul, un-
diligent people. While there is
great importance accorded to the
demands students may make
upon professors. little is actually
said about changing curriculum.
Most of all, there is an expected
lack of anguish, of nonssuccess,
of failure. Life comes too easily
in the movie. The film conveys
only a very pleasant and
sometimes amusing picture of

Luienisf Plays to Capacity Crowd in Herrick

Considering the type oi concert
attendance that Grinnell College
frequently bestows upon its
visiting artists, David Harris
might have been mistaken tor the
Pied Piper of Grinnell Hamlet
when he presented his lute and
classical guitar concert last
Friday evening. Lured by the
promise of an unusual and his
teresting evening, Grinnellians
ventured fourth from their ivys
covered closets and ﬂocked to
Herrick Chapel. But similarities
to the tale of the “Pied Piper
of Hamelin” end there, as the
enthusiastic throng was not
robbed of its expectations. In
fact, David Harris did a very fine
job, presenting a concert con-
sisting primarily of unfamiliar
Renaissance lute music to an
audience that knew little about
the lute or the literature com-
posed for it, and he 1made them
enjoy it. The audience obviously
appreciated not only his music
but also his casual remarks about
tuning, the squeaky chair, his
instrument. and restless
children. He prefaced most of
selections with program notes.
and the only problem with this
was that his voice was barely
audible beyond the tenth row of
pews. Harris is probably ac-
customed to smaller audiences,
as the lute is an intimate in-
strument and is not easily heard
in halls the size of Herrick.

Harris’ performance was not
ﬂawless; his runs were not

always even and he visibly
flubbcd In a few places. But
considering the difficulty of the
instrument (several avid lute
fans have told me that even
Julian Bream has been known to
inuit a passage), one could say
that he maintained a high level
of performance throughout the
concert. I should mention that
besides being a performer,
Harris also has a scholastic in-
terest in the lute. He researches
the music that he plays, and, in
fact, several ot the works per-
formed last Friday had been
discovered by Harris himself. of
the three schools of lute music
that he presented, the English
school seemed to have the most
audience appeal. Its rhydims
were more interesting than those
of either the Italian or Spanish
schools, and the contrapuntal
play between high and low voices
easily captured one’s attention.
I also thought that the “Fan
tasia” by John Duwland was the
best-executed work of his lute
performance. Even though parts
or it were played to the ac
companiment of the 3:35 Rock
Island train whistle, he exhibited
more control over his instrument,
and his runs came through
clearly and evenly,

Harris began the second part
of the concert with three Bach
preludes, two of which were
written for lute. The first of these
he played on the lute, but for the
second the guitar was used. This

to guitar is frequently done,
because the strings of the
Renaissance lute are tuned in
relationships similar to those of
the guitar’s strings He remained
on the guitar for the third prelude
and the two works that followed.
His command of the guitar was
quite impressive, and his ren-
dition of “Hommage au Tombeau
dc Debussy" was very well done.
The three Villa Lobos pieces were
probably the most familiar works
on the program. and they too
were performed with skill, Of
these the ”Prelude No. 4”
presented the most difficulties,
as it contained a passage of,
chime-like harmonics which can
try the patience of the best

a strong possibility that he will '

performance but because he is
willing to spend time lecturing
about music and talking with
students. nis appearance at

introduction to an instrument

and I for one feel that we profited
much from having shared a few
days with him.

then, the significant variable was
the coffee. The question
becomes: had the printer not
offered a sampling from the
widely-renowned pot, would
Turner’s boys have raided?
Obviously, the answer is that Mr.
Turner would have confiscated
the materials in any case. Far
be it from this phlegmatic pur-
suer of crime to cease and desist
for want of a little caffeine.
Having perceived the disdainfui
ire imprinted on the face of this
distinguished administrator, I
refrained from pursuing the
discussion, for fear that Mr.
Turner might pursue me.

By this time, Richard C.
Turner had succeeded in Die

fact, Mr. Turner relented mer-
cifully and said“! hope you (the
students in the room) don’t

decency, along with his com-
mittant declaration that he had
been the first state official to
support legalized consumption of
beer for 18 year olds, and his
admission that he drank beer
when he was in college (most
likely for him some sort of ab-
struse puberty rite enacted to the
music of the Alley Cat hubcap
band), induced little solace and
many guffaws among our group,
One fellow was heard to say as

I consider it a matter of the
most general good taste not to
burden the reader of these pages
with manifestoes. Not, of course,
that good taste is necessarily my
inclinatio it being one of the
hack‘s ju ier pleasures to crank
out Ringing Declarations of
Principles every few weeks,
However, I find myself con-
strained by a certain verbal
chastity and its concomittant
desire not to be made a fool of
in print or anywhere else,

1 had thought that it might be
interesting tolearn a thing or two
about sports and to gain a
measure of fluency in the
language, (Lloyd also said that
I could read Paul Weiss's
Philosophy of Sports and say so
in the newspaper. But the library
didn’t have a copy, and Lloyd
refuses to talk to me anyhow, so
that will just have to Wait.)

Now it’s fine, when you‘ve got
a couple of columns on the
editorial page and a deiphic in-
scription on the mast-head to
think like Aristotle. Which I
don’t. I do, however, write like
Aristotle, to wit: dreadfully. So
it behooves me to follow some
of the Grand Masters of English
prose: c. s. Lewis, James
Thurber, Tolstoy (in translation,
of course), and the estimable Mr.
Bertrand Russell. In fact I had
planned to write a piece replying
to last week’s “Letter to a Young
Athlete” in his style (e.g.
“Although an admirable
scientist, Mr. Newton’s memory
is discredited by his pernicious
Laws of Gravity, a curse to all
rightrthinking humanists, which
just last week caused me to {all
down and sprain my ankle”).

Apart from leaving a con
siderable body of writings upon
which jock-scriveners can hone
their prose, Russell served
another profoundly useful pur-
pose: that of the reasonable man
with a big mouth, He was a
gadﬂy, which is a term Platonists
use because they don’t really
want to say “pain in the aft.”

It was remarked the other day
by a professor that the view of
politics and by implication other
forms of human activity seen as
a subspecies of theology is on
the wane. Many would hold that
this is a sign of our enlightened
times, Such times being defined
as those in which a gadﬂy is a
shrill and superﬂuous nuisance.

The following are excerpts
from a speech reprinted in the
NCAA News, the official organ
of the Collegiate Athletic
Association, of which Grinnell is

Way of Sports

amember.

Eddie Robinson of Grambling
College, speaking to the Houston
Touchdown Club:

“Football has made its con-
tributions to you, the new breed,
because the game of football is
like life itself; there are lessons
to be learned, responsibilities to
be accepted, obstacles. .ac-
cidents and even defeats to be
endured, sweet victories to be
savored and all played under the
rules of the game, .

“Football builds basic
character in boys. it gives them
strength enough to know when
they are weak and makes them
brave enough to face themselves
when they fail. . , to master
themselves before they seek to
master others (Sic). ..

. .the boy has ample op-
portunity to discover his
weakness of character and to
build them up. If he lacks
aggressiveness, he will soon find
out. He will learn, too, why
aggressiveness is so necessary
for success. . .

“Football’s greatest con-
tributions are yet to come. I
believe football will go on being
a tremendous inﬂuence for good
in American society, a constant
inspiration to American .youth. .

Now apart from the realization
that American football is not
played at all abroad, much less
to lose, I found this Whole piece
rather disturbing, Sports an-
nouncer Howard Cosell once
noted a tendency in this country
to look upon momentous events
as though they were sports and
upon sports as though they were
truly momentous; this in itself
is a disquieting observation, but
itbrings me around to my point.

Since it is fashionable at the
moment to sneer at all but
political forms of moralism, and
pietism, this is a little like
dentiiig a dead horse. Sports are
entertainments, pastimes, and
recreations: they are not subject,
it seemsto me, to moral analysis,
much less to Mr. Robinson’s. As

Our last two home meets are

this weekend. Today we face the
toughest dual meet competition
so far this year, Carlton College.
Their distance combination»
Arnessen and Davison, will be
tough in the 1000, the 500, and
the zoo. The first event, the med.

the greatest races of the day.

Adelman in the butterﬂy, and
Hancock in the backstroke round
out our days greatest threats.
The meet is at 4:00, promising
exciting races and good com-
petition.

Saturday’s meet against St.
Olaf should not be quite as tough
as Friday's. Bruce Rollins faces
Wemsen. last year’s conference
champion in the too They have
good medley and freestyle teams,
and a good backstroker. Mike
Keller, last year's runner up in
thc ccniercnce diving event,
should be tough competition if he
makes it to the meet

These are our last two home
meets. We are undefeated thus
far and have high hopes for
continuing to be so. Come and
see a winning team today at 4:00
and tomorrow at 1:30.

Previously forecast to be a
contender for the conference
title, the Lawrence Vikings
provided little competition for
our Grinnell swimmers. Even
John Fease, conference record
holder in the 500 yard freestyle,
was lapped in that event by John

200 by Mike Daley, whose 1:55.e
tied the pool record. After being

Women’s intramural Volleyball
byCilidyRoot

Although men's intramural
sports seem to draw all the
crowds, the action is actually
ovcr in the women's gym, where
the womcn of Grinnell are
waging their annual battle over
lM volleyball.

All forms of skill arc obviously
lacking. A one-handed punch is
the favorite technique, The
strategy is rather basic; just get
it back over to the other side of
the net, quick‘ Still, the en.
tllusiasm is overpowering 7 I
mean, how many people would
actually kill themselves to take
a swipe at a ball that was sailing
10 feet out of the court? The girls
do it all the time!

Smith is definitely the team to
heat with two wins and no losses,
They even managed to pull
through in a double overtime with
Langan, Their strategy seems to
be to lose the first game so badly
that when they come on strongly
in the next two the other team
ncvcr has a chance to get back
up Keep it up, Smith! The
college is also Iiclding a pickup
volleyball team to play with her
women‘s league in town every
Monday night. So come on out
and volleyball it up for awhile.

Alld for all you avid fans who
are sitting on pins and needles
to get the results of your favorite
tcams~we'l| keep you posted.

Scoring was slow in the first half,
but in the second half the
Pioneers began rolling in the
shots to build a lead that Cornell
could not overcome. Height
proved to be a great advantage
as Bob Burnett paced Grinnell
with 14 points and Greg Beckman
hit 12 Gary Johnson, Greg
Bombillski, and Scott Hanson
scored consistently from the free
throw line to enable Grilinell to
coast to a tenapoillt victory,

Half time saw one Building
Team pitted against another as
the precise shooting of the 0b
Squad and the Faculty set
basketball back ten years. The
Oh Squad introduced in
novations: 40 players per team,
totally unbiased refs, and dunks

riotous half time entertainment.

Grinnell continues its home

Friday and Knox Saturday, The
Pioneers have already equaled
their conference wins from last
year, and, if they can keep up
their momentum, may be able
to climb from the Midwest
Conference basement.

1000; Bruce Rollins swam well
in the 50 and the 100; Steve Ward
did a good job in the individual
medley. Daley, Ward, Jim Cams,
and Rollins teamed up to break
our school and the Lawrence pool
records in the 400 yard freestyle
relay.

Beloit provided little better
competition for us than
Lawrence, as we swept five
events there also, Ron Brammer,

good effort in the medley relay,
Chris Freebcrg followed with his
