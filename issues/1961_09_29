Some Answers . . . .

I have been asked to comment on the college’s admission
policy, especially with regard to two questions: Why was there a
signiiicant dect e in the proportion oi new students irom the
Atlantic states e.. from-24 per cent oi the new men and 18 per
cent oi the new women in the tall oi 1960, to 11 per cent and ti
per cent respectively, in the iall oi 1961?

Il admissions po icy looks to a wide geographical distribution
oi students. why is the proportion oi new students trom Iowa
about 25 per cent, and the proportion irom the Iowarlllinois area
about so per cent?

The basic iact regarding applications irom the Atlantic states
is this: the proportion ot' Atlantic states applicants representing the
“cream oi the crop" oi that section, in scholastic ability and in
talent, has been low relative to the proportions oi similar appli—
i-ants irom Iowa, Illinois and contiguous states.

This'is not to say that we tail to get numerous applicants
r, hin the high range oi ability and talent irom the Atlantic
states; but the proportion oi such applicants, measured against the
total oi all applicants irom that eastern area, has been relatively
low.

Ii we are to remedy this disparity, we must llavel a substan-
tially higher share oi the “cream oi the crop" oi Eastern secon-
dary schools. We can become more widely known as worthy
ci a substantially higher share, provided that our admissions
policy indicates what we seek. Temporarily, until our standards
and requirements are widely understood, the proportion oi new
students irom the Atlantic states will likely be lower than we
Lope/for in the long run.

why are the proportions oi new students irom Iowa and irom
the Iowa-Illinois area so high" The explanation largely is that
the college has long lived in t l area and his continually attract-
ed applicants at high scholastic ability.and talent irom this area.
The high proportions oi Iowa and Iowa—Illinois students grow
cut ol the relatively high volume oi applications inhcrent in the
college's history, location and reputation.

In addition, the college must maintain and cultivate its ties
with the communities irom which it derives its principal material
support and its historic good will. For that reason, among others,
we strive to encourage this high volume oi superior applications.

Over the years, moreover, the students irom Iowa, Illinois
cud contiguous states have proved themselves as capable as .those
irom elsewhere in contributing signiiicantly to the stature ot the
college and its nonprovincial character,

I should like to put my answers to the two questions in the

 

tontext of additional facts. First, whether we consider. geogrnplliml‘

distribution oi new students or other characteristics, proportions
(percentages) are otten subject to much accidental variation irom
year to year.

For example. the proportion oi new men irom Iowa was Is
per cent, and the proportion oi new women irom Iowa was lb
per cent. in the tail of 1961). Second, a desirable wide variety oi
characteristics in the student body depends on numerous iactors,
at which geographical distribution is one. These include distribu.
tions oi iamily income positions, nds ct community (urban,
suburban, rurall, parental occupations, academic interests and
achievement, extracurricular interests and participation, occllpih
tional interests and social interests,

Third, in terms oi these numerous jnctors; we have achieved

wide variety oi characteristics in the strident body, and we

1‘ ve accomplished this concurrently with a substantial impl‘n\'er.\

ment of scholastic ability and talent in the student body.

.1 . . . And Some Olher Answers

Dean Stiltlss' statement collcerllll :ltllni sions policy
marks an important step in the hives gallon of the admis-
sions question. It appears to tls that certain realities, un-
fortunate though they may seem, have to be accepted in
the policy, at least until someone comes up with a very
specific, and feasibly better plan.

The question which seems lundamental to the problem, i

”Are .the eastern schools in general-sending us tl lower

caliber student than Grinnell expects?" will be investigated‘

along with auxiliary questions by the admissions committee

of the SGA. What does come out of this initial statement

by the administration are some symptoms of confusion be-

Eetween those wllo make the policies and those wllo execute
lem.

We must be aware of the very difficult job the ads,

missions office has; however, we should not have to expect

ithat percentages will differ as much its five per cent be-:

tween the proposed geographical breakdown and its final
results. If an attempt was made to return the Iowa per-
centage to its expected high anti compensate for the former
low by turning down second-rate applicants from the East,
this may at least at this juncture appear reasonable.
What should not be overlooked. lion-eve . is the overs
compensation in the execution of the policl all efforts
should be made, and, we believe, now are being made, to
compensate, as it were, lor the over-compensation.

Each year when autumn comes‘gaingl the growing Colnnllmisl,‘

Huvuig done so for scvcral‘ sear
suns, I become ll'l‘ltable and dis
rout-aged, take to writing letters
to editors and almost lose sight
of the solid reason [or arguing
against such ioollshncss.

We lcnow these almost by
heart: the analogy which prev»
ping suggests between the halls
and Greek—letter tratcrnites is
misguided and misleading; the
,psychology upon which it is
lbused ~ that young lncu can
lsomehow be made more agree-
luble by subjecting thcln
,progrnm oi humiliationris false;
‘even prepping governed by
pietics about “orientation" allows
a more or less iree hand to up-

bled souls. And so on. 1

Everybody has heard the l

arguments. The only new is- ,

anybody with any sense of ;
group pressures in a society is

fooled by that. ,

things, simply corny, like the

NSA Congress—Lari lll

, One of the maior problems}
that currently faces the Unitcd‘
States National Student ASSOCiar
tion is the lack of contact, co-op.
eration, and cowrdinallon be.
tween the member college and
the region, and more serious, be“
tween the region and nationall
office.

The problem is especially acute
in the IowarNcbI‘aska region,
The reasons are varied: (1) pasli
officers have been very inactive
and uninterested in. the region‘s
progress, and (2) the region it,
self lacks interest and activities,
due to the number and type ol
schools affiliated with USNSA.

For the 1961762 school year a;
new type of regional program rel,
being initiated by the member‘

 

schools of the IcowEl-I\Iel)l"dska~
Region eniitled “Operation Ops
pol‘tuniliy." Originally it was

planned as an Iowa—centered re-‘
search program that would study
the question: Why do 50 per centl,
of the young men and women bee]
tween the ages of 18 and 35 leave
the state of Iowa. This program
has, ,already received a grant
from the Iowa Development
Commission to cover the costs‘
of conducting such a study and
also the holding of a regional
meeting concerning the finding.
of the, study.

However, Grinnell’s part in
the program is unique. Due to
the fact that Grinncll and
Drake University have large
out of state populations, the
program has been broadened to
provide Grinnell with that
chance to conduct local investi»
gation on problems that con-
cern the entire nation.

Orinnell may choose to inves—
tigate racial discrimination Ite-
cent events have indicated that
such discrimination is not unique_
to the South, Grinnell wouldl
conduct a study to\disco\ler~ii
discrimination does exist in eats
mg places, barber shops, sleepil
ing facilities, etc., in Iowa. ‘

In addition, the study of racial‘
discrimination in Iowa would
also be of interest to the state
government, At the present time
there is a law that declares raciall
discrimination unlawful in the
state of Iowa.

The commission that is set up‘
to carry out this law is under-

, staffed and consequently can
conduct investigation in only the
larger cities. It is readily evi—
dent that a report concerningl
discrimination in the smaller;
towns of the state would be read
with great interest by the Come,
mission,

The results of the study wouldl
be included in the regional re—
port and would also serve as re—
search information for commit
tees on racial discrimination at
the national congress of USNSA,

Two very important aspects o
the program. must be stressed
First, the choice of topics to
study is unlimited. Examples in-i
elude the migrant farm labor
problem in Iowa. the situation
concerning public housing and
the previously mentioned racial
discrimination question.

The second aspect of the pro-
gram is that it is designed to

PPESIONS

Felluw freshmen:

The president of this freshmen class will be con—
fronted with two important responsibil' ies. First, he
will represent the entire class in the Grinnell student
Senate, and second, he will have the task of stifrtulat-
ing the development of class productivity and unity\

Every candidate, as a potential officerWhas a re—
sponsibility to familiarize himself with the office and
the campus issues with which he will be required to
deal. This I have attempted to do by exploring the ,
issues now before the senate and by discussing them
with the s. G, A. president and a number of senators.
Thus, I feel prepared to represent our class in a sena—
torial capacity. _ _

Each of us must ask himself certain questions con<
ccrning class productivity and unity-What can we do
for the college?.What can Grinnell do for us? What can
we do for ourselves? ' '

' It is traditional and appropriate that each freshman
class undertake a. project which will load toward _an
adequate answer to these questions, In a discussion with
an upperclassman who has organized a freshman class
project (in this case to raise money to bring a foreign
student to Grinnell), I found that far too often a proiect
such as this results in an accumulation of work on a
few individuals, rather than being truly the response
of the entire class. Obviously, this freshman proicct
needs a fresh outlook, _ _ ‘

Soon the student Senate will be discussing the my
stitution of a program toward the development of an
better place to begin than with the incoming freshman
“honor code" system at Grinnell. I feel that there is no
class. This would be a worthwhile and stimulating class
project, and would benefit the college, the class, and
each of us as individuals. . -

The freshman orientation program has been the

-siibject of much criticism and discussion in many cir—
cles. Some of the aspects which require detailed study
this year by all of us, especially by the leaders of the
freshman class, are: -

1. Tire test required of women students upon cam-

pletioii of the program. . _

The notable lack of freshman representation _

especially for the men students _ in the Stun
dcnt Senate.

3. The rather high schoolish organization and pre-

sentation of orientation lectures, ‘

I have definite suggestions to improve this program,
one of which is specifically designed to give freshman
more signifignnce in student government. I plan to pre—
sent these programs at the mass meeting- Sunday‘ eve—

iiin .

gEvery freshman should attend this meeting and _
consider carefully the platform of every candidate so
that a wise choice can he made. This is your responsi—

hility.

 

 

 

 

Z.

Sincerely, ‘
Jack Hurwitz

Ford Gran’r

Cont. rrom p. 1
the Ford program for awards to
small private colleges rollows a
similar series or grants made
to private US, universities last
year.

Orinnell came into competition
101' one or the grants only att—
ei- Bowen had written Ford as
to "How 1 Would Spend a Mil-
lion Dollars,“ and a 125-pagc
application had been ﬁlcd with
the Foupdation.

Following a visit here last
winter by a Foundation reprc»
senlative, a meeting was held
between the Board of Trustees
and Foundation oilicials At this
time the possibility of a $2 mil.
lion grant was raised.

Official notiﬁcation as to
which colleges had been select.
ed for the awards did not come
until last Friday afternoon when
a rou page release was wired
to Gr ncll from the Founders
tion.

Bowen explained that Grin
nell received the funds because
it has excelled without great
endowments. Grinnell ranks, he
said, as a school wlnch will
produce the best returns in edu—
cational beneﬁts from the Founv
dation’s investment.

The President said the a.
ward will he used to launch
a sour-part spending program
which includes $450,000 per
year earmarked ror regular
operating expenses; $375,000
each year in addition to
permanent endowments, S400,-
000 per year for a special edu-
cational opportunity rund and
‘another sxso,000 per year to
ﬁnance a building program.

Explaining the educational op-
portunity fund, Bowen said it
would be used, as opportunit' s
occurred, to ﬁnance special prol-
acts or activities to enl'ich- the
college’s academic eiiort.
fund might be used roi such
purposes as the acquisition or
scientiﬁc equipment otherwise
out of reach, to expand the coin
lege’s collection or art objects,
to ﬁnance additions to the li.
brary, to employ distinguished
visiting professors and to back
studentefaculty research. All this
will be in addition to the al-
ready planned increase in fan—
ulty salaries and aid to stu—
dents.

Outlining the building pro—
gram, he said that preliminary

plans [or a new student union-X

recreation complex may be

started this rail. other building‘

projects which may be possible
are _an athletic ﬁeldhouse, new
dormitories for men and for
,women and remodeling jobs on
a number of campus buildings.
including Darby gym, Steiner,
Good'now and Carnegie halls.
The ice Skating rink now under
construction is also part or the
building program.
