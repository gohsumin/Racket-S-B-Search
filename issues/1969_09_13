' Deans Act On.

'A student who was dealing
In mescaline voluntarily withn
drew from the college Wednes<
day afternoon following a con-
rerence with Deans Alice Low
and Conney Kimbo earlier in
the day, the 5828 has learned.

Two other students were
placed on conduct probation by
the Deans earlier this week in
unrelated incidents involving
the use of illegal drugs.

Although the Dean’s Office
refused to provide any infor-
mation regarding the cases, the
S“! has learned that the ale
ieged dealer was given the
choice of withdrawing from the
college or racing immediate
Judicial Council action,

Once the student elected to
withdraw, the deans instructed
him to vacate his room immed-
iately. The student left Grinnell
early Wednesday evening.

According to fairly reliable
5&3 sources. the deans learned
that the student was dealing in
mescalina from an informant
who had purchased a capsule
of the .hallucinogen irom him.

As the result of another inci-
dent Sept. 2. a Cleveland
sophomore was placed on con-
duct probation after being hos-
pitalized for an overdose of
several types of drugs.

While under the influence of
a large amount oi hashisll that
he had smoked earlier in the
day, the student took a double-
dose of mescaiine late that
afternoon, Feeling no immeda
late ellects irom the drug, he
took another doublerdose of
mescaline about fifteen minutes
later.

Fellow students found hlln in
a very disturbed state and
attempted to calm him by ad-

ministering Thorazine, a tran-
quilizer, and some sleeping
pills.

The Student seemed to re-
spond and went to bed, but
shortly alterward he suffered
Violent convulsions. After stu~
dents notified the Health Cen-
ter, an ambulance was suiti—
moned. The patient was taken
to City Hospital in critical con-
dition by Grinnell pplice. (Grin-
nell has no ambulance service.)

The overdose almost resulted
in the youth’s death, doctors
reported, but he recovered and
was released from the hospital
the iollowing day. He was
questioned by the police. but
was not charged.

The student was called to the
dean’s office Sept. 3. Rather than
face the prospect of Judicial
Council action, he allowed the
deans to put him on conduct

1|“ng

probation for a year. The deans
also warned the Student to
aVOld future involvement with
illegal drugs.

in a third incident last Satur-
day, a Conference House
sophomore went to the Health
Center alter taking mescaline
and experiencing painiul side
effects. There have been some
indications that the mescaliile
may have contained strychnine.
a poisonous substance ii taken
in large doses. The student was
also placed on conduct pro-
bation aiter conferring with the
deans.

Administration actions appear

to conform with the revised col< .

lege policy on drugs which
states that ‘ “students are
Warned that they will be subject
to disciplinary action up to and
including dismissal him the
college, for distribution of dan~

SE5

gerous and unlawful drugs, and
that they may be subject to
disciplinary action for possess
ion or use."

The Student Handbook also
states that parents of students
placed on conduct probation
will be notified at the dean:
discretion.

The President's Office will
issue a clarification of the
existing drug statement in the
handbook next week, according
to Dean Low. Although she

,could not ‘discuss the contents

of the forthcoming statement,
she indicated that the president
would, in part, comment on the
necessity of maintaining a late
ltude or options ior handling
cases of drug use.

Convocation Opens New Year;
Leggett Calls for ‘New Limits’

 

By TOM THOMAS

A sparse crowd of several
hundred students and facility
members heard President
Glenn Leggett discuss the “Site
nation in which the small pri-
vate college finds itself" as he
addressed the opening convoca-
tion of the 1969-70 academic
year. Also speaking at the
Sept. 3 event in Herrick Chapel
were Dean Joseph Wail, Pro-
fessor John R. Kleinschmidt,
Chairman oi the Faculty, and
James Lew, President of the
Student Government Associa-
tion.

Referring to the small pri-
vate college as “perhaps the
one unique contribution at
America to higher education,"
Leggett traced the history of
such institutions and raised nu-
merous questions ior the iuture.
Leggett obliquely reierred to
the tumultuous experience of
higher education during the
past year, calling the environ-
ment of the collegiate system
“almost terrifyingly reflective
of national agonies,"

“Every institution . . . now.

faces daily not only the prob-
lem of raising money, educat-
ing students, and recruiting
and retaining faculty. but also
the anxiety brought on by the

FLAG AT HALF-MAST

The Grinnell College flag is

a resolution passed by the
student senate, President
Glenn Leggett authorized the

extra-legal aspects oi General
Hershey’s Selective s e r v i c e
System. by the long delayed re-
volt or the American Black, by
the confusion of pornography
and public obscenity with jour.
nalistic integrity and literary
merit, and by the nalvete of
our laws on alcohol and drugs."

The President told the midi-
ence that “the inevitability or
living with this complex or
problems is the prize that edu-
cational institutions have Won
by putting themselves success-
fully near the center of national
life.”

Wilhelm Sues College for libel

A $35,000 libel suit has been
ﬁled against the college by
Henry Wilhelm, a former Grin-
ncll student who now operates
a local photography gallery.

in the lawsuit filed Aug. 28 in
Poweshiek County D i s tr i ci:
Court at Montezuma, Wilhelm
alleges that because of actions
by Mrs. Ruth Prescott, DireCa
tor of the Information Services,
he was “exposed to public
hatred, contempt, and ridicule"
and suffered “irreparable dain-
age to his reputation as a
photographer.”

Wililelm charges that he was
“depiivcd of public confidence
and sufferer] osti-ization (sic)
from the community" because
the lniormation Service dis-
tributed to area news media

‘ “a false and derogatory state-

KDICVFM, the college-owned
radio station,

The editorial, coauthored by
Neil Fischer and Gregory
Schmidt and delivered by Fis-
cher, accused Wilhelm of or-
ganizing the Feb. 5 nude protest
against Playboy magazine so
that he could sell photographs
of the incident to news media.

Wilhelm charges in the suit

editorial ”was in part false and
defamatory” and that she “did
maliciously publish the mate-
rial with intent to defame and
injure the plaintiff in the eyes
or the public.”

in a cover letter sent out to
area news media with a copy of
Fischer’s statement, Mrs. Pres-
cott said. in part: “Our pro-

PPPE Sponsors Julian Bond

Julian Bond, a Georgia state
legislator who is rapidly gaining
national prominence, visited
the campus this weekend as
politician in residence under
the sponsorship of the college’s
Program in Practical Political
Education (PPPE).

Bond, now 29, gained national
exposure last year tlilringtthe
Democratic Convention.

As cochairman of an insub-
gent Georgia delegation. he
played a leading role in the
unseating of the regular
ceorgia delegation. Later in the
Convention. he was nominated
for the vicerpresident spot on
the Democratic ticket. He with-
drew his name because he
failed to meet the minimum age
requirement for the office.

Bond’s entry into politics was
surrounded by controversy. He
was elected to a reapportion-

ment created seat in the Georgia
House oi Representatives in
1965. However, legislators ob<
jetting to Bond’s statements on
the Vietnam War managed to

November, 1966, and in Dec-
ember of that year the u, 3.

was’ entitled to membership in
the Georgia House. He took the
oath of office and became a
member of the House on Jan.

laid, “it is possible to say

Dean Wall echoed several of
the themes of the President’s
speech, but from a markedly
different point of View. Wall,
too, commented on the “special

'it is as if the nation were pre-

t. Sumpter rather than for
that most typical of all autum-
nal scenes in America, the

Wail observed the calm that
has marked the nation during
the past summer and said
"there are many who feel that
it only we did not have students
to contend with, we would have
no problems at all.” Wall de-
cried such an attitude, because
"in reality, none of the prob.
lems that brought violence into
the streets have been or have
even begun to be solved."

Explaining the title of his
address, “The Mud Below, The
Sky Above,” the new dean said,
“man is a study in paradox,
every man stands in the mud
and reaches toward the sky.
But it is a little more complex
than that, {or although every

“What it seems to me a liber-

at education should be about iS‘

the correction of our sensoly
perceptions. We need to look
obieciively and purposefully at
the mud beneath our own feet,
and at the same time, seek for
some understanding of the

Wall touched on the dangers
of extremism, saying, “It is
the absolute certainty of the
extreme right and the extreme
left in their own righteousness

- that make them the antithesis

to'the liberal arts that they
are." Such questions were, in-
deed, the main theme of SGA
President Lew's remarks.

Said Lew: “Our own worst
enemy would be ourselves. We
often have what seem to be
good ideas, yet are unaware or
the consequences that our ac-
tions might have.”

Lew Claimed, “I believe in
logic.” Explaining mat logic,
not altruism is important in the
solution of contemporary prob
lems, Lew added that, “Even
more than logic I believe in
winning."

Pl‘olessar Kleinschmidt sound-
ed the most traditional themes
at the Convocation. He told of
being moved by the resignation
of over twenty [acuity mem-
bars at a Canadian university
because of strident activism,
He pondered the possibility of
such eitects happening here at
Grinnell. Addressing student
activists who would destroy the
college, Kleinschmidt said,
“Buzz oil!"

The taculty chairman re-
peated the theme, “This is not
your college," several times
during his remarks. Referring
to the wider constituency oi' the
college -— alumni, parents, and
{uture students — Kleinschmidt
commented that change must
not be ariccted lmpetuously,
but considered in terms of
“reverence tor the past and
relevance tor the present."

Concluding his address,
Kleinschmidt said, “Sio ’Emi”

 

B. B. King is Scheduled
For Darby Gig Tonight

By PETER KEEPNEWS

The Beale Street Blues Boy

Mississippi has been granted an
audience with the King of the
Blues. in other wordsias if
anyone out there had to be
told ~ B. B. King will be here
tonight.

B. B. King is almost certainly
the most iniluential guitar play-
er around. Twenty years ago
B. B. was playing things on
his guitar Lucille that were to
be picked up on, much later,

come blues classics. His sing-

At the Atlantic City Pop Fes-
tival this summer, heroic a

crowd that had been weaned

blues drew seven standing ova-
lions.

All [his talent, all this excite-
ment, all this blues will be
happening in Darby Gym
(sometimes known as the Fill—
more Midwest) beginning at
9:30 pm. and going on, most
likely, until B. E. completely

through the years and years or
one-nightstands, he has pro-
bably never given a perform<
ance that was less than sensa-

B. B. King is at the height

Gifts to College

Despite last year’s wide-
spread fear that sensational
publicity about Grinneli would
discourage wealthy donors from
making contributions, unre.
stricted gills to the college
amounted to more than in any
comparable previous year.

Unrestricted gitts to the col-
lege from all sources during the
10 months ending last June 30
totalled $660,790, a 51 per cent
increase over the 11-month ﬁs-
cal year of 1967-68.

“Why there was an increase
is a question on which anybody
could have an opinion,” Pres
ldent Glenn Leggett said last
week. "Certainly the Develop
ment Oiiice ought to get some
credit for it."

“it could be that at a time
when colleges are in linancial
trouble donors and friends are
responding," Leggett added.

Donald Lambie, Vice Pres-
ident and Treasurer of the col-
lege, attributes the increase to
the Academic improvement
Masterplan, the ”AIM
Program” under which the
Development Oiiice is soliciting
donations.

“We're in a major campaign
that has put more concentration
on alumni responsibility to the
college than in normal years.”
La‘lnble explained. "It would
have been disappointing ii there
hadn't been such a response.”

Both Leggett and Lambie be
lieve that the sensational
publicity surrounding the
Playboy protest resulted in
some loss or potential donors
to the college. “We had several
speCliiC instances oi individuals
withdrawing pledges," Lamuie
commented.

College lunds stem irom three
major sources—student rees,
endowments, and gitts, Gilts
are given mainly by trustees,
alumni, corporations and busi<
nesses, and religious denomin-
utions.

Both the president and vice
president expressed pessimism
about the financial Outlook for
the college this year. “We
aren't going to be as well on -
as we were a year ago," pre-
dlcted Lamblev

"The inflationary trend oi the '

economy is causing all ou «

out. “The declining stock mar}

ket will be very detrimental to 37%;“

the college, since donorsoiten

”And a. downtrend in ih

even it donors are considerin

“Good business conditions ilk.

The structure, designed and
engineered by the Chicago
architectural firm Skidmore,
wings and Merril was orig-
inally planned for completion

caused by bad weather and
spring rains have moved the
tentative completion date up to
September 1, 1970 tor the gym-

tor the swimming area.

The architectural iirm is also

The contracted price for the
33,463 square foot building, let.
to Gilbert Construction or Iowa

however, will be tor the general

will be four enclosed handball
Courts, The whole ﬂoor surface
or the gymnasium area will be
covered with Minnesota Mining
and Manufacturing’s new "Tar.

a 220 yard track.

The pool area will contain a
5 lane x-sliaped pool, 50 meters
in one direction and bit yards
in the other. This is to.aliow
the pool to meet both AAU and
Olympic regulations.

Since this complex is being
built with assistance from the
federal government it will be
mainly, in the words or Mr.
Walden, “an educational Iacil-
it ” Its use will therefore be
limited mainly to physical edu-
cation classes. This is demon-
strated by the absence oi any
seating for spectators in the
gymnasium and limited seating
or approximately 250 in the
pool area. Because of this fact
all varsity basketball games

the drug situation at Grinnell
has mounted during the past
few years. Early this tall
during the student advisor
workshop. Dean Low predicted
that there is a greater potential
tor drug arrests at Grinnell than
in recent years, citing recent
multiple arrests in lowa City
and Des Moines. According to
the Dean, law enforcement
agents will not notify the college
administration it they plan to
crackdown on illegal use oi
drugs here.

"it we don’t clean up our own
house, somebody else will clean
it up for us.” the Dean said,

Assistant Dean Kimho told the
son that "there should be a
concern about the use or drugs
on campus." Kimbo cited the
need for better education about
drugs and pointed out that
resident advisors are trying to
organize discussions in the halls
on a personal basis.

“These are areas or prob—
lems, although students may
not consider it as such,” Kimbo
added.

Students have also expressed
c'oncern about the drug
situation Cleveland Hall pres-
ident lra Eolnick is presently
working with several students
and resident advisors to develop
a drug symposium'at Grinnell.
The purpose of the symposium
would be to eradicate the pre-
sent ignorance about the legal
and medical hazards of drug
use.

Drug Policy
Needs Revision

During the first two weeks of the new semester, two students
were placed on conduct probation alter seeking medical attention
It the heaith center while on “bad trips.” Another student who
was dealing in illegal drugs “voluntarily withdrew" irorn the
college at the request of the administration. .

Tho deans displayed poor judgment in their handling or the
ﬁrst two incidents. According to the Student Handbook, the col<
lege recognizes “the serious possibility oi damage to the mental
and physical health of (drug) users” By disciplining students who
visit the Health center with problems stemming trom the use or
drugs, the deans are discouraging students from seeking medical
attention when their lives may depend upon it.

In the case of the student who took an overdose of mescaline,
untrained fellow-students —- rather than seeking immediate medical
attention — administered drugs that seriously endangered the stu-
dents life, presumably because they feared disciplinary repercus
oions, it should be obvious to the deans that disciplinary handling
ol medical problems will only increase the dangers of drug in-
,volvement at Grinnell.

Although professional ethics may require that the details of

rsonal cases handled by the deans remain Confidential, the

recy surrounding the probation incidents is indefensible. All
ynernbers of the College community are entitled to know when,
and why, the deans discipline students. The college has recognized
Bimilar rights in the past by requiring the disclosure of judicial
council proceedings

in the case of the student dealing In mescaline, the deans Bib
orcised better judgment. A student who is so blatantly indiscrere
that the deans are aware of his drug involvement is a danger not
only to himself, but to the entire community, and it is perhaps
best for all concerned that he withdrew from the college.

The mistakes made during the past two weeks point out the
urgent need for the creation of an adequate drug education pro-
gram at Grinnell. Such a program will be worthless if it consists
ol nothing more than the goverment propaganda nlrns previously
used to scare students away from drugs,

Grindeil needs a drug education program that honestly ap-
proaches the physiological, psychological, social, and legal conse-
quencea of experimentation with drugs. It must examine not only
the dangcra of drugs, but also dieir positive potential.

A statement clarllying the college drug policy is expected trom
the President next week. He can no longer ignore the many deli«
Gate questions integral to the solution of the drug problem,

Is the college reverting to an in loco parentis policy in its
handling of drug cases? Will continued disciplinary actions dis<
courage students from seeking needed medical care? is the drug
policy consistent with other college regulations oi student conduct?
These are only a few of the difficult questions that call for lm<
mediate answers,

Poor iudgment in the past has precipitated the current drug
problem at Grinnell. Necessity demands a realistic reappraisal of
The situation now. -- M.B., TIT.

card last spring. He was re<

duction Sept. 2.)

To the Editor:

Today i and other young men

the process of being inducted
into the Armed Forces of the
United States of America, Ten

illegal and immoral. At the

other American soldiers are
being used around the world to
protect the American Empire,
to protect the economic inter-
ests oi the giant corporations

I reiuse to be inducted into

to do so would Violate both my

I leiuse to be inducted in

interests of a group which
continues the violence of living

poverty, doing this by at-
tempting to suppress any move-
ments challenging a status one
which is built on oppression.

To enter the armed forces of

Off-Campus students seek sacs option; Vote probable

By MOLLY MCGUIRE

l Off-campus seniors may be
able to forego their board fees
this year, thus giving up their
"privilege" to eat SAGA food
in the dining halls, If an all-
Itudent referendum proposed
Tuesday by the Student Affairs
Committee (SAC) indi-
cates support for the measure.
The referendum will determine
it the majority of the student
body is willing to pay a alight
increase in board fees that
would enable their offrcampus
peers to say goodbye to SAGA
and fend for themselvesi

The recent action by the SAC
is only the latest in a series of
measures taken to explore the
possibilities of giving students
options to the present policy of
mandatory board fees. At the
present time, all students must
pay for board except married
students and those originally
mm the city of Grinnell.

Last spring, alter complaints
by future off-campus seniors
and in light of the response to
the SAGA committee’s ques-
tionnaire (where students indi-
cated a desire to be able to
forego the blanket board fee),
the SAC issued a list of sug-
gestions to the administration,
asking them to find speciric in-
formation about various pos-
sible options. About a month
later, on May la, the commit~
tee issued a recommendation
to President Leggett for a tem-
porary plan tor the tall semes—
ter: they asked that “students
not in college housing be given
the option of not paying the

board fee, and thus not eating
in the campus dining hall."
this proposal was for the loss—
70 school year only, until a
more satisfactory plan could be
worked out, The committee
malized that there “may be
some problems in the imple-
mentation of the recommenda-
tion. ”

Problems there were. Be-
cause of the late date of the
suggestion and the illness of
one of the key personnel in-
volved, nothing was done about
answering nr approving the
proposal until this 1811. Mean-
while, about seven offrcampus
seniors decided to refuse to pay
their board fees at registration,
hoping to put pressure on the
administration to do something

immediately about the recom-
mendation. After being sent to
talk to six diltereht adminisr
traticn oliicials, the students
were given an ultimatum to

pay their board fees by Mona ,

day, Sept 8th, or they would
not be considered students at
the college. (All have paid;
students they still are.) They
were also told that the deans
were currently considering the
recommendation.

Considering it they were. On
September 5, following otiicial
procedure, President Leggett
sent Professor Edgar Mullins,
chairman of the SAC, a re-
sponse to the suggestion of last
spring. in it he stated that he
saw problems in the implemen-
tation of the request, and that

he had asked the deans to take
certain measures to “begin the
necessary analyses that would
provide us with descriptions of
Viable options for long- range
food service arrangements for
all students. ”

Leggett cited the possibility
of a rise in board charges next
semester and thereafter for
those excused to make up for
those exempted from paying
board (the fewer students pay-
ing, the higher the individual
board cost will be), and the
possible need of a checking
system In the dining halls, He
felt that because of these pos-
sibilities, every student should
be informed and be able to
have a say in the issua.

One of Leggett's requests to
the deans was to find out exacts
ly how many seniors presently
living off-campus would take
advantage of the option now
under consideration, so that the
business office and the SAGA
business manager could figur¢
out the difference this would
maké'in the SAGA proiit and
thus compute the possible risé
in board charges next semes~
ter.

in accordance with this, Data
Low held a meeting Mohda
afternoon (Sept. 8) of the Stu:
dents interested in the option,
Nineteen seniors signed theii
names to a statement saying
that, if they had the chance
they would choose to forego that;
board charges. Mrs Low prom
ised that when and if the op.
tion went into effect they
would be refunded their board
lees with the price of the meals
that they had already (presum-
ably) eaten deducted.

With some 20 students (mar.
Iigned the list later)‘ not pay-
ing board, the fees per student
would go up about $5.00 a set
mester, it was reported at the
SAC meeting. The administra-
tion would absorb the cost thil
semester, but since next se~
mester the board fees of those
not excused would be attected,
the committee believed tha|
students should be able to have
a say in whemer the option it
instituted or not. The matter
of checking procedures in the
dining halls might also be u
problem that would affect the
rest of the students, who might
be asked to show an ldenilﬁrv
cation card at all meals.

“What a Drag”

‘Frosh Views Orientation

by Edward Levine

Having tlown eight hours to get to Grinnell, I had hoped to
ﬁnd a rather dynamic New student Days program. Alas, whata
dragl I could [ind no redeeming characteristics. The faculty-stu-
dent colieehour on opening day was not unlike that unfortunate
occurrence in college life. the mixer.

The next two days contained some of the more horrible exper-
iences in my young liie. Most or my time was spent either stand-
ing in lines or listening to very standard rhetoric on such topics
as race and drugs. The college seems to think that ireshmen come
to the campus ignorant and unaware. So the people running New
student Days have mediocre speakers address the students, as
coming that this' will satisty the “preps”.

But the biggest crime committed by New student Days is that
it does not correctly depict lire at Grinnell. Lite is not ordered
and dictated on this campus, yet time during New Student Days
is taken up by scheduled activities. As one sophomore pointed out,
some ireshmen are scared to go to the john because that activity
Is not on the New Student Days calendar.

The solutions to these problems are not simple. One answer
might be the midsummer orientation many colleges have initiated.
If this is not feasible, at least the high schoolrlllte atmosphere
which now pervades New Student Days should be eliminated
'Presently the only way tor a treshman to beneiit irom New Stu-

dent Days is to throw away the New Student Days calendar.

Saturday's Francesco Chamber
Trio Concert you missed the
stunning premiere or Grinnell's
new musicians - in - residence.
The trio played Mozart, Ravel.
and Schubert to a “standing
room only” crowd at Roberts
Theatre. The concert was a
great success, and the group
was called back for {our cur-
tain calls by the audience.

The Mozart Trio in C Major
K. 548, which was the trio’s
iirst selection, was good over»
all, but not at all up to the
standards set by the remainder
of the program. Pianist Nathan
Schwartz had difﬁculties with

a on isolated soit runs. How-
ever, this certainly does not

detract trom his overall playing

ability and probably was a re«
sult at his uniamiliarity with

the action of the Baldwin SDrlU
concert grand. Throughout the
rest or the concert his playing
was superb, especially in his
sensitive treatment of the deli-
cate work in the Ravel trio.
Cellist Bonnie Hampton had
virtually no chance to show her
skill until after the Mozart trio,
since it is very nearly a piano
solo, containing very little
writing tor the cello. But in the
Ravel her sound. was very
warm and delectable, and in
the E»Flat Major trio oi Schu-

bert she turned the most diffic-
ult passages into effortless cas-
cades or sound.

David Abel coaxed marvelous
sounds from his violin all night
long. Even in Roberts, where

they do agree on one ideal: “do

words have been espoused
previously, this class seems to
put them into effect. They see

Nearly 50% al‘ Registration
Miss the Point

By A STAFF WRITER

Although 666 students took the
intluenza injections oiiered dur-

ly one halt of the students who
registered ﬂew irorn the ilu
shots. ,

According to a Health center
spokesman, “the biggest chicke

students, While the largest block
of “takers” were in the 94 1b..
female, freshman category.

An iniormal poll oi students
sneaking out the southwest door
at Darby Gymnasium to avoid

tioned at the northwest door
yielded several interesting com-
ments.

“I wasn't going to let them

stick some bi'g needle To me,"
and “l deterred upon religioul
grounds” were typical respon5s
es, but it was also learned that
many students had moral obe
jections to what they calledﬂ‘an
obvious attempt by the college
to lorce somahzed medicine."

A poll of students who had just
taken the shot was less reveal-

, in the resolution of black stu.
'dent problems on college cam-
puses, Grinnell has been as ras
inarkable in its calm as others
have in their turmoil. Changes

that have been accompanied by
yiolonoe on scores or campusol
have occurred at Grinneli quiet-

and seemingly without prob.
‘ms, These changes are the
result of black student “recom-
riendstions" made to a Ma
0 meeting of the college trus -
oes in Chicago.
» A resolution paged by tho
trustees at that time stated the
intent of the college “to deal,
in all reasonable ways, with tho
hhallonge of developing a goal»
ity pmgraiu of higher education
{or black students and . . .
to approve such budgetary de<
iiciencies as may be deemed
by itself and the president to
be necessary and appro note
to implement this policy.’

“Specifically, the Board en-
dorses the president’s present
Intent to continue the axlstin
scholarship program [or black
students and to recruit necess-
pry faculty and staif preferably
black, to develop a studies pro-
gram (both academically and
extra-curriculerly) so as to im-
prove and make more relevant
the intellectual and emotional
environment of the Grinnell
College community tor all stu-
dents, faculty and stall, both
black and white.“

The recolilnicndatlons, which

both black and administration
sources preferred to term “ile-
clarationsoi need," were, in
addition to mose stated in the
trustee resolution: additional
black professors in all fields,
black advisors and counselors
in both Admissions and Deans
offices, special consideration of
black students from poor secon-
dary education backgrounds b
the Admissions cities, an of
campus Black Culture House,
a minimum at sixteeon black
freshmen in the class of 1973
and future years, and college
supplementation of tho Rockoa
teller Foundation grants to min<
ority students (the Rockefeller
grants had been scheduled for
a complete phaseout in two to
three years.)

Changes Underway W

Implementation of all these
recommendations is under-
way, although each ls in
a diflerent stage of devel-
opment. Additional black pros
icssors and a comprehensive
black studies program are still
in embryonic stages due to keen
competition for “qualified" per-
sons. At present only a "Specia}
General Education Program1
exists in AtroAi-narican Studies,
but it is hoped that by second
semester is tentative major will
be available.

A lectureship series in Black
Studies is planned for this sem-
ester, and possible speakers
will be Saunders Reddillg, a
Morehouse College historian.

Both the Dean's and Ad-
missions Oiiices have under.
gone changes since last spring,
the result being greater re-
sponslverless to black student
needs. There are two new black
faces ill the Dean's ofilce, Con-
ney M. Kimbo, Associate Dean
of Students; and Mrs. Dorothy
'P. Guy, counselor to women
students.

“Dean Kimbo was hired be-
cause he is highly qualified, not
because he is black." asserted
Dean Alice Low. Kimbo's duties
will coincide with those of for-
mer Dean 5, Eugene Thompson
(except for the editorship of tho
Grlnnell Magazine, plus soma
additional responsibilities. Hil
blackness is not being emphas-
ized, and he wants to be seen
as an all-campus advisor.

“I doubt if the black students
knew l was going to be hired
until it. happened," said Dean
Kimbo, smiling.

Counselors Appointed

Mr. and Mrs. Charles R. any
will be Grilmeli's black couple
in residence. Before coming to
Grinneli, the Guy's taught in
Mississippi. Guy will work in
the Admissions oriice, Mrs.
Guy in the Dean's Office. Her
title is listed in the catalog as
“Advisor to Black Women Stu-
dents," but Mrs, bow assures
that she will be available to
all women students.

Mrs. Guy will fill a real
vacuum in student advising.
Whereas black men have at
least had a few black professors
with Whom to identity and seek
adVlce, black women have had
no one. M. Charles Seller,
Associate Dean of Administra~
lion, put it this way: ”women
who are black have had no peru
son with whom they may disa
cuss their situation. They feel
particularly isolated."

To serve in a general ad-
visory capacity to black stu-
dents, there will he a joint.
Black Student Coordinating
Committee, representing the
Student Government Associa-
tion, the Concerned Black Stirs
dents (CBS), the Student Coord-
inator's office, the faculty and
the administration.

in regard to self»advisillg, the
black student organization on
campus, Concerned Black Stu-
dents, has also undergone “134
jor restructuring. Instead of a
president shoulderillg the ad
ministrative burden as in past
years, there will be a governing
triumvirate, c o in p o s e d of
sophomore Linda Copeland, and
seniors Frank Thomas and
Gregg Coggs.

“Protectorate oi! the People"
This new governing body for
CBS will be called “kotol-ro,"
on African term of unknown ol'<
igin meaning “protectorate or
the people”, when asked if he
thought black students at Grin-
nell need protection, Thomas
replied, “I think Black students
everywhere need protection."
With all of their requests
acceded to by the adminis-
tration. CBS's future policy is
uncertain. Asked what specific
plans they have for this year,

nest Weston said, “we don’t
know yet.” Frank Thomas says
the most immediate. though
less tangible, probleln to be
solved by black students “is to
develop a better understand“:
of ourselves and our potential.‘

The most visible of the new
developments millteting toward
this ideal oi pride and sell-con-
fidenco is the Black Culture
House. It is located on the
corner of Tenth and Park
streets, adjacent to the soccer
lield.

its focus will be, simply,
black culture, and all that it
entails. A library, artistic dis-
plays oi all kinds, discussion
groups and seminars are
planned to explore the cultures
of black people in America and
elsewhere. Two students will
live there as caretakers, and
presently sophomores K a r e n

serving in this capacity.

dent spokesmen emphasized the
“openness” of the new house.

KDIC Resumes

Peg Morrison, manager of
KDIC, looks forward to the
campus radio station's second
year or broadcasting. KDIC,
Grinnell's lorwatt educational
radio station at 89.5 on the EM.

dial began broadcasting early
last week,

KDIC’s broadcasting history
began in May, 1968, when it
presented a brief schedule of
programs, going all the air im-
mediately alter Alumni Week-
end. Continuing last; school
year, under the managership
of Al Cloud, it completed its
iirst full year of broadcasting
in the small studio built over
Darby gym — a waiting room,
record library, and Z-room

studio, KDIC’s first broadcast'

this school year, from this
studio, was on Wednesday,
Sept. 3, at 4:00 pm, when
sophomore Pat Corbett went on
the air,

Peg Morrison and executive
board member Paul Lewis
agree that there are some for-
tuitous changes in station pol-
icy since the last show of last
year.

Miss Morrison summarized,
“it’s no longer a new station;
it should concentrate on being
a responsible and reliable sta-
tion,” .

Paul Lewis is KDIC's Pro‘
gram Director. He is eager.
and vocal, about the potential
role at the radio station as a

creative outlet for the student

body.

“The radio station exists by
and tor the student body," he

Broadcasting

said, “it can and should be a
creative outlet, particularly in
the formal areas of music and

drama. but also in the informal
areas, like the talk shows.”

Student personnel last year
numbered nearly 100, or 1 out
at every 17 or 18 students. it,
is expected to remain at this
level during the year.

The disc jockeys and newsu
casters work on a 7-day-arweek
programming schedule, from 4
to 12 each afternoon. Their prlr
grams are divided into several
categories to provide’a cross-
section or campus listening i
terest. Reviews and previews
at events Will be interspersed
in a format leaturing rock,
classical, blues, and country-
western music.

Plans are underway for a
more campuscrlented approach
in broadcasting than last year,
with emphasis being placed on
campus news and talents. Use
of “distributive services” will
be reduced. Services such as
the BBC, Radio Fairs, and the
intercollegiate Broadcast Serve
ice with their prerecorded
shows, may be largely re-
placed by presentations or the
viewpoints of faculty and ad‘
ministration. “it's a thrust to
im p r o v e communication," a
staff member remarked.

Commencement Disruptions Reviewed Six Trustees Are E'ected

To New Terms On Board

Following student disruptions
or lost May's commencement
ceremony, President Leggett
has asked SGA President
James Lew to appoint a strident
committee as soon as possible
to begin planning early for next
year's commencement actiVit-
ies.

“One at the duties oi the
committee would be to poll
seniors as to who they wont

to speak at commencement,"
Leggett said last week,

Last May's Celemony was iii-
teri-upted several times by dISr

gree was conierred on Tarr by
President Leggett, sophomore

Force."

Gllck's appearance drew
icers irom some oi the 1,000
parents and alumni present.
Leggett led Glick cit the plate
iorin as shouts of "Get him
out oi there" and “Drag him
away” rose from the crowd oi
parents and alumni.

Eight oi the graduating
seniors walked out at the cere-
mony alter Torr received his
degree. They returned several
minutes later, strode onto the
platiori-n, and stood silently as
senior Dan Cheitetz harangucd
the audience about “the Wi'DtigA
side priorities of the Gi‘ililiell
education." Cheifetz, too, was
booed and jecretl by some in
the audience.

Cheitetz also awarded I
“Doctorate oi Lite” to senior
Bonnie Tinker, whom the col-
lege retused to give a degree
because she would not take the
required comprehensive ex-
umination in theater. Miss
Tinker wrote a 23-page critique
of the comprehensive examin-
ation program in place oi her
exam.

Miss Tinker picketed the
commencement ceremony and
also made some unscheduled
remarks when Cheifctz intro-
duced her: After the ceremony,
she explained that she was pl'n<
testing “an educational system
that reduces education to con-
ditioning, which equates intel-
Iectual doubt with moral neu-
trality, and which reinscs to
actively participate in the
world."

More than one-third oi the 255
graduates and numerous pro.
iessors wot-e white armhands
over their black gowns to
symbolize their opposition to
the war and the awarding of
a degree to Tarr. The wives
or two faculty members

picketed the ceremony with
signs saying, “Griiinell College
honors another cog in the war
machine."

u. 5. Senator l-iarola Hughes
(Dem., la.) delivered the come
mencement address, in which
he called tor "a continuing
dialog between the older and
younger generation” and slip-
ported students’ rights “To
lawiul, non-Violent protest."

“The vast majority oi dis-
senting students do not want
to destroy the American dream,
they want to redeem it,”
Hughes said.

H u g h e s condemned insur-
rection and illegal Violence by
protesters, but warned that
“the argument that the only
way to maintain order is to club
the innocent along with the
guilty is both ialse and danger-
eous," .

The senator also told the
graduates: “Truly eiicctive
social and institutional change
will occur only from the appli-
cation of trained intellect,
spurred on by commitment and
guided by the values of liberal
learnhig’."

I mean, what would you do if

their beer, go to Burling and
scale maids and get trapped in

in the eiiort to be understood by
somebody, anybody. it s a super
identity crisis for cncketsi

All the time, these people ask-
ing why crickets 'don’t stay on

don't stay in the kitchen or
something. And then when you
do stay on the hearth, like in

Mr. Kenneth Christiansen, of
the Bio. department, is an en-
tomologist, and he is probably
closer to the cricket scene than
most people here. Black iield
crickets, he says, don't do much
harm to plants, so iarmers
don't even spray them. We
passed several on the way from
his ofﬁce down to the insect-
rack, or whatever that thing is

“Why so many crickets this
year?” I asked

either abolish crickets or wear

‘ Faculty in Meet. '
Agenda Uncertain

The faculty will meet in their
ﬁrst regular meeting or the year
this coming Monday. A possible
lupic of debate will he student
attendance at the prﬁenily
closed meetings.

A 5-man special committee
has approved a proposal to deal
with the student attendance
question, according to Raymond
Bells, chairman or the group.
“This means very little. it is
up for discussion, amendment,
and ultimately to rejection by
the members of the iaculty,”
Belts said.

Grlniiell will continue to grant
academic credit for Reserve
Oiiicer Training Corps (ROTC)
courses until the Air Force
completes the phasing out-oi

the Grinncll unit on September
1, 1972.

P r e s i d 9 it t Glenn Leggett
announced the decision in a let-
ler sent to all members of the
faculty on June ll His decision
iollowed a discussion or ROTC
accreditation at a icgulatly
scheduled meeting of the board
of trustees the preceding week.

“The effect of this decision
is to permit Gl'innell students
of the classes of 1970, 1971, and
1972 now enrolled or eligible tor
the program (presently 29 stu.
denls, diVided among the three
classes) to take nrnorc
courses for credit in the estab~

.lished sequence until they are

graduated and commissioned,”
Leggett stated. “The 1972 class
will be the iinal commissioned
class at Grinnell, tor on Sep-
tember I, 1972, the AFROTC
unit at Grinnell will be com-
pletely withdrawn irom the
campus."

The president continued:

“It is my own belief, whlcl’i
1 suspect is shared by many
faculty members, that it is
pedagogically unwise to com-
press or tamper with the se-
quence oi ROTC courses so as
to permit sophomores or juniors
to get all or most oi the requir-
ed courses out at the way by
1970 or 1971.

Dr. Leggett reiterated that

the college, in agreement will:
air Force directives, will or
continue the recruiting of so
dents for the Grinneil ROT
program and that no new slut
dents will be enrolled in hJ
program unless they can co
plete the program heiore the

"The passing attack should be

is the big question mark be-
cause of inexperience. The de<

in the backﬁeld and should im-

Bowers says he sees St. Olaf,
Monmouth, and Ripon as the
conference powers with Coo and
Gl’innell as darkhol‘ses. He
believes that the team will be

Fischer also said that at the
time of the broadcast both the
low: Attorney General’a Office
and Mrs. Prescott "indicated
to me that they had some evl<
denoe that What I said in the
editorial was true."

In his request for $20,000 gens i
oral damages and $5,000 spe-

cial damages, Wilhelm allege:
that the statement distributed"
by the college “through Ruth
Prescott" made it clear that he
was being referred to in the
editorial, and that he was “oo-
cused oi the crime oi conspiri-
ocy to commit a misdemeanor,
oi advocating or inciting crime
for his own profit and that the
plaintiff is operating a rolling
business.”

Wilhelm charges that as a

“suiiered o c o n o m l 0 loss

Wilhelm’s enrollment at the
college was terminated during
tho lessor year tor academic
reasons. At that time he was
co-editor oi the 1966 college
yearbook which the college res
fused to publish after legal ad-
visers round that a variety of
material for the book was po.

’ tentially libelous. Wilhelm said

Wednesday that he is "still
working toward publishing the
yearbook, but money is a prob<
iem.”

Asked whether he had helped
organize the Playboy protest so
that he could take photographs,
Wilhelm replied, “That whole
notion is absurd."

Wilhelm admitted being pres-
ent when the protest was or.
gallized, but denied that he par-
tlcipaled in planning the dem-
onstration, He said that neither
Fischer not Mrs. Prescott ever
contacted him to Verify the al-
legations in the editorial, and
that “no one has ever apole
