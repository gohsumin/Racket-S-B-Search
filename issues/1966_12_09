“Every sane person knows
that it is a better thing to
build a City than to bombard
it, to plow a lield Ihan to
trample it, to serve mankind
than to conquer it, And yet
once the armies get loose, the
terrific noise and shock 01

The issue coming out next

Jones, said that he hopes that
the papers will spark enough
crillcal interest to merit formal
replies (in the form at essays
of 500 words or more) from
the student body or Ille iaculty.

The staii intends to put out

Editorial

The last line

In the last two years I have participated directly in
the production of over sixty issues of the Scarlet & Black
. . . some 500 pages altogether. This is the last and I am

lad, but it it were mine to do over again, I would not
esitate. Sixty weeks . . . maybe 1,000 hours. Perhaps, I
nan best conclude by trying as best I can to tell why.

Why? is seldom an easy question to answer. This is
no exception. I could as easily tell why live, for the answer
is much the same.

It goes beyond a commitment to journalism. Journal-
ism is no sacred cow of mine. It goes beyond a desire to
correct the failures of Grinnell College. Though this is per-
haps part of the answer. Ultimately, I suppose, editing the
8&3, is part of search. A search which I share with my
classmates and probably with every other generation that
was once young and idealistic. A search for harmony and
meaning in the lives of men.

In a world like all human worlds, filled with hypoc-
racy and hate, is there no way in which men can live in
honesty and love‘.7 Is there no way in which individual
good is compatible with common good. Cannot commun-
ulism and nationalism give way to humanism. Must some
men always die that others may live.

The particular tool I have brought to my search is
a typewriter. There is no end to other approaches. The only
absolute seems to be that the search must he made. In
a nuclear world we canot share Frost’s unconcern:

A111 worry about is the sun ‘
We’ll be alright if nothing goes wrong With the
lighting
If we continue to fail in our search, Bob Dylan may have
come closer to the truth:
It’s a hard rains a gonna fall.

Editor Needed Again

Due to the resignation of editorelect Suzanne Gelber, the
5&3 again needs an edllof [In the next two semesters. Interi-
estod students should submit a letter or lppliuilion giving
qualiﬁcations and suggesting improvements in the son to
Henry-York Steiner, English, by Wednesday noon.

 

Educator Decries Grades

Two recent studies indicate there may be no direct relation-
ship between high grades in college and later professional success.

Dr. Eli Ginzberg, a new York researcher, studied a group oi
842 Columbia University graduate students who had won ieliow-
ships to the school between 1944 and 1950. Findings showed that
students who had graduated with honors, won scholastic medals
or had been elected to Phi Beta Kappa were more likely to he in
the “lower professional perlormance levels” than Students who had
not so distinguished themselves while in college.

In another study, a learn of University at Utah protessors
toiintl almost no relationship between the grades a medical student
gels and his laier perlormance.

petty rewards 7 names on honor rolls, medals, gold keys ——

else." it's usually 8 combination of grades and extracurricular
participation that indicaies success in later lire.

Faculty Comment

A Crime" Dilemma

By EZRA MENDELSOHN
Hlslory

I have been asked by the Scarlet and Black to
comment on the question oi student sexual moral<
ity. 1 claim no special knowledge which would al-
low me to speak with certainty on this complex
subject. but I believe that my recent arrival at:
Grinnell gives me a iresh perspective. I welcome
any response to my observations and suggestions,
for it. is clear that a continuing discussion is nec-
essary lot the establishment and maintenance or
hamiony among some students, faculty, and ad-
ministration.

One response to the debate over visitation and
women’s hours is simply to condemn all student
premarital sex. it is imitlcss to argue with
people who sincerely hold this position, just as it
is fruitless to argue with sincere Moslems that
Mohammad was not the prophet oi Allah. it is my
assumption, however, that premarital sex is not
necessarily harmful or immoral; it is likewise my
assumption that students who engage in such ac.
tivities at Grinnell should not feel that they are
committing an illegal act which, it brought to the
attention of the authorities, will result in severe
penalties.

To be sure, the problem is greater here in a
small, midwestem, Christian Community than it
would be elsewhere. I have been part of academic
communities in New York, Philadelphia. and
Israel. At each of these places either the institu<
tion was more liberal with regard to the sexual
behavior of its students than Grinnell, or the lo-
cation itseli provided the opportunity to enjoy a
relatively free social lite. But it is just because
Grinnell is what it is that we need to be more im-
aginative in solving our problems. On the one
hand, wo-‘have intelligent and, i think, tairly so
phisticated students, attracted to Grinnell because
ot its high academic standing. 0n the other hand,
we live in a narrow social environment. Concerts,
athletics. the occasional touring theater or opera
company are commendable in themselves, but we
all know that we ultimately spend a very small
percentage of our leisure lime attending these
iunctions. What most of us want to do (and I as-
sume that Grinnell students lire no exception) is
to talk, eat, and drink with our friends. We are
not going to sleep with every person with whom
we become friendly. We may not even wish to
sleep with those whom we love. But we are all
made to feel guilty in a system which treats visi-
rations as “occasions for sin," and we are all
made to feel uncomfortable in a system which im-

poses strict regulations and then tacitly ag es not
to enforce these regulations as long as iscres
tion” is maintained. 1

1 know that the common reply to the accusa-
tion that it is hypocri 'cal to have rules which are
discreetly ignored is. “You have more freedom
now than you would it the rules were enforced."
And I am aware of the criticism made of the
students that. by their protest, they only impeded
the eventual relaxation of regulations. The tirst
statement can scarcely be defended. As for the
second point, it seems to me that the students, by
making their teeiings known in a restrained and
responsible fashion, achieved lar more than they
lost. 1 take their action to be a sign of maturity,
rather than the reverse, and I think it is a highly
encouraging sign that Grinnell students are think-
ing not only of their exams and papers, but of
other problems as well.

Assuming that the students are sincerely up<
set by the lack of freedom which characterizes the
Situation at Grinnell, can We hope that laculty
and administration will be more responsive to
their needs in the future? Can’t we make a lasts
ing contribution to this whole question by think-
ing in terms of building new dormitories, which
would provide decent sitting room: for small,
informal parties? Can‘t we allow more upper
classmen (and women) to live oftcampus, it
they wish? Can’t we relax visitation regulationsi,
And can’t. we think in terms at establishing
oil-campus social clubs, so that students might
occasionally escape from the familiar (sometimes
all too familiar) atmosphere of the College?

The essential question, perhaps, is whether
Grinnell is to follow, or to lead. A“! we of the
iaculty and the administration prepared to take
certain risks in order to create a more healthy
situation at the College? And, no less important,
are the Students prepared to accept new respon-
sibilities (after all, greater freedom implie‘
greater responsibilities)? We know, in these post~
Freudian days. that sex cannot be swept under
the table. or snblimsted by means of fifty mile
hikes through scenic Iowa. We know that a
healthy attitude towards sex, one which recoga
nizes its tremendous potential lor both unselfish-
ness and harm, is dependent upon attitudes to-
wards authority, hoth parental and institutional.
Let me close wlth a plea that the whole ques~
tion or student sexual morality be explored anew
in the true spi 't of iniellectualism.

I stand with a iamous 19in century thinker,
who appended to one of his treatises: “Dixi et
salvavi animam meam.”

intonnally with student lead-
ers and deans, and that he
values student opinion, as
shown in the formation at the
credit~tail system and the in-

concluded by saying that the

This Week We Got letter

EDITOR’S NOTE!

Never in the recent history
of the 58:3 have our readers
turned out so much yardage
of “letters in the editor" as in
the last week or two. Nor, we
might add, has so much or
what they have had to say
been quite so relevant.

Nature of lhe Problem

so the Edith"

A curious incident occurred
last week which, in view oi the
actions oi some students, may
be regarded as almost amusing.
Mrs. Low, Dean oi Wonien, ap<
parently not satisfied with only
an administrator’s view of the
student problem, aised a num-
ber of philoso hical issues in
the hope of gai ng some philo-
sophical insight into the causes
and the principles involved in
the Grinnell College student
problem. i say amusing, because
there we have an administrator
with perception, intelligence,
refinement, sociability, execu-
tive ability, and a successiul
career who shows humility be-
fore the great problems oi hu-
man nature and is not airaid to
seek more knowledge and un-
dcrstanding betore translating
it to action; and in contrast, we
seem to have a number at stuv
dents on this Campus who, not
having yet begun to earn a liv-
ing and iace the hard realities
oi lite, have already decided
and therefore think they know
what is right for Grinnell Col-
lege. So, since what is right is
good, it lollows that these stu-
dents know what is good for
Gl'innell College; and if so,
they must know the nature oi
the Good.

0h Socrates, 0h Socrates,
where art thou Oh Socrates!
Alas, you have lived behind the
times. for here at last we have
found youths at. Gril'lnell Col-
lege who have once and for all
caught a glimpse of the nature
of Good. But peace be with you
in your grave, Icr your mission
has finally ended in triumphant
fulfillment,

Easy to end it with “Amen“,
yet too easy a solution. A care-
In! reading oi last week’s sail;
reveals an abundance oi honor-
liic, condemning, emotional,
and other such terms, dense
with heat but void oi light; tor
example, such terms as ”pro-
gressive," "initiative,” “signiﬁ-
cant r e i o r m," “liberalized
rules," “new ideas" and the like,
not to speak oi phrases taken
out oi context and used to sup»
port a theory. Progress or init—
iative may be towards a good
as well as a bad goal, and the
same applies to the others. or
course, this is not altogether an
indication oi wrongness or
rightness. What’s behind the vi-
olationsl

Generically, the usual Cams

plaints by some collegc stu-
dents. Times have not changed
The general terms are “rules"
and “morality,” and the species
are premarital relations, no
hour restrictions or almost so,
a place in the sun, an outlet for
discontent and frustration, a
slight amount of radical agitaa
tion, and many others too nu-
erous to mention. A note or
sympathy tor you dear students:
I too participated in a general
student strike at Columbia Col-
lege in the 1930's tor a reason
I never knew, and my share oi
“rebellion" throughout has been
more than average.

Specifically, there seems to
be some justiiicstion for the
student's violation. It may run
thus: hour restrictions are main.
ly ior preventing premarital re-
lations; some students have
such relations without penal-
ties; others have been caught
and heavily penalized; this is
an injustice; besides, morality
is the student’s business, and
he is mature enough and wishes
to practice responsibility; ergo,
away with restrictions, it justice
is to be equally distributed.
There are other minor assump»
tions. Now let us consider the
general problem,

in deiimng a liberal educa-
tion, it is well to state its pur-
pose iirst. We may restrict it
only to getting knowledge, but
does this take in the “whole
person?” If good living (or hap-
piness, or enjoyment, whatever
you wish to call it) is the end
or lite, is mere knowledge
enough to assure us of this?
Knowledge may be used also for
evil ends. Should a College al-
low this? Certainly, there are
many aspects to the whole mart:
mental pleasures, physical pica.
sures, social pleasures, good
health, perhaps others, and the
instruments which lead to them.
such as ciiective habits and
money. 1i the college restricts
itselt to knowledge, aren’t we
iorgctting something? who will
make the integration? The stu-
dent? This presupposes a big
assumption. Good living or hap-
piness is to some degree a mat-
ter of art and hence of learn-
ing, and ii so, act involves both
knowledge and certain habits.
Again, it morality does not en»
ter into the picture, or it it
does but is strictly a personal
matter, then either no one has
a right to condemn another, or
such condemnation is meaning
less. it morality does enter,
should the student be allowed
to detine his own morality and
act in accordance with it?

Certainly not, ior contradch
tions arise. Morality is deter-
mined partly by wishes, and two
wishes may contradict each oth-
er. Both A and B may want C,
but can both get it? We cannot
let the thiei or the gangster
have his way in the College.
one wish may destroy another.
it the student’s wish is allowed
to t d that of the administr

tion may have to fall; and i
am not sure the College can sur»
me. if the girl students want
no hour restrictions at all, the
parents (probably the majority
in the ease oi Gl‘innell College)
may object. and they pay the
bill, Certain students want noise
in the halls, others suiier and
object; hence there is compro-
mise and rules, whether by the
majority or train above. Any-
way, the College should have
rules and should pay at least
some attention to morality. The
absence of any rules spells cha-
os, the absence oi morality
spells jungle life, and society
cannot exist without one or the
other.

who should make the rules?
Too broad a question, tor there
are rules and rules, and there
are fewer rules and many rules.
As a whole, the faculty make
the academic rules, though now
and then they change them,
cg, ironi percentage grade to
letter gradc, anti back again
(you sec, we too are restless,
only human you know), but at
least, once we make them, we
stand by the majority or else
we are ﬁred. What about rules
concerning unkempt hair, no
haircuts, lousy dress appear.
ance, no shoes, and the like?
Well, when you seek a job af-
ter graduation, necessity knocks
at the door. so not much iuss
by us, even it the sensibilities
oi some oplc are offended;
and sensib ity comes under the
heading oi appreciation of beau-
ty, and beauty is good, of course
(even the ltussians are begin-
ning to see this, now that the
revolution is over). Anyway, a
small matter. so no fuss, as long
as you do not parade naked in
the streets (and please do not
call such parading a “personal
morality”), ior this would be
overly disgusting. There are
rules, then, which the students
are willing to abide by, mostly
because they themselves suifer
by their absence.

As for morality rules, natur-
ally, some students want no
dormitory rules which, among
other things, tend to prevent
or make difiicult premarital re.
lations, So to have their way.
most at them use such reasons
as “responsibility," “the m tu -o
and intelligent student,”
gressive morality,” and the like.
Few are irank about it. So the
problem: should the college
abolish hours restrictions and
rules ailecting premarital re-
lations? But we are back to the
original theme, the problem oi
conilicting wishes.

Assuming that morality is a
good thing, then good for what?
Out of sense oi duty? Duty for
what reason? Kant does not con-
vince me. But if morality con-
tributes to the total enjoyment
oi lite, then the questio by
what means can such liie be
tamed? a relevant question,
deed. Sexual pleasures do con.
tribute, but so do other kinds
oi pleasures (and we may bunch
them all under Truth, Beauty,
and Goodness), and not under
any chance circumstances, tor
serious conﬂicts may arise. So,
using the Utilitarian Prinn' le,
there is an art oi maximizing
(as the mathematician would
say) the set of all pleasures,

e alive:

You’re in the Pepsi

and such maximizing calls ior a
harmony oi pleasures, and this
requires an art which presup-
gases knowledge and certain

abits. One may get pleasure
out oi both friendship and i
sulting everybody, but the lat-
ter pleasure destroys the iorm.
er. Thus, this art calls ior an
analysis oi the kinds and weight
of pleasures and oi harmonious
habits (the concern ot many a
philosopher), and such analysis
and the attainment oi harmoni~
ous habits are indeed no easy
tasks.

Must we go on? The story is
very complicated, and students
who claim superiority in this
field should better reexamine
their thinking. Simpliﬁed aSs
sumptinns are a sign at little
and inadequate thinking, toi-
ethics, like politics, is a very
complicated and ditlicult field.
Most presidents of colleges
would welcome a change, it it
is for the better; but a change
based on simpliticd assumptions
may be risky. Some students
told me that they wish to make
Grinnell College a testing
ground ior their “new morality"
and ior tree premarital rela-
tions, approved by the college
administration, but this would
probably be too risky and per.
haps the death oi the college.
There are many wishes to be
reconciled, and vast knowledge
of how these aflect the total
weliai-e oi the college is re-
quired.

Turning to an item about
rules mentioned earlier, justice
is better served if rules, wheth-
er strict or liberal, are eniorced
strictly and hence evenly, The
student is inclined to look the
other way (for various reasons),
and perhaps someone else
should be assigned. A similar
situation exists in the socallcd
Honor Systems; they work it
all are honorable. But since you
almost always get some who are
not, in such cases there is more
injustice than ii, say, tests are
strictly supervised. I would
rather have a liberal set oi rules
strictly enlorced than a strict
set badly eniorced.

I also think that an adminis-
tration should be quite explicit
as to its position concerning
rules and spell them out to
avoid misunderstanding; and
even beiore the student enters
college. in this way, the student
may take it or leave it at the
start. This should not prevent
inter-discussion by the students,
iaculty, and administration for
possible changes. But the iti—
mate authority in determi ing
changes should rest with the
administration, and tor obvious
reasons. We all have to iollow
rules made by others; the lamb
ty iollow those set by the ad-
ministration or president, the
president iollows those laid
down by the Trustees, the Trus-
tees by their majority. ii so,
what Divine Authority has given
the students the privilege of

petty 1551195 and became martyrs
when rebuffed. We make (tour

and Consider it a victory, re-
gardless oi the damage to the
college. X am not sure this is
a sign of maturity. Perhaps it
is better to take a cue from
Dean Low and open up discus,
sion {or deeper knowledge and
understanding regarding the
greater problems we are facing.
Neither the faculty nor the
president here are discipline
rians. So, during your four years
here, working together rather
than against each other would
he the better way.
This is a personal View.

To the Editor:

Some weeks ago I had tho
pleasure of dining with Presi-
dent Leggett at a Frair’s dinner,
When the conversation turned
to the question oi North Cam-
pus living conditions, our guest
replied that the problem had
been greatly exaggerated and
that he was fairly pleased with
the situation. i was truly
shocked, tor the living condi-
tions are, in tact, absolutely
wretched. Hall life is often con-
ducted on a mean and vulgar
level which is incompatible with
serious academics and social
maturity. It is one thing to
curse and tell bawdy jokes on
occasion, but it is another when
the way of life is permeated
with obscene behavior, ungen.
tlemanly conduct, and intellec-
tual stagnation. One tires oi be-
ing known by dirty names or or
watching cigarettes being ilip-
ped at the TV. One also iii-es
oi seeing his supposedly mature
friends ostracize and humiliate
some other person because they
think he is diiterent. Happily,
I have escaped this way of life
by moving oil-campus, but I
haven’t escaped the problem.
My iriends in the hall say that
disruptions are yet worse this
year. eiiectively preventing
serious studying. Just the other
day, I walked through one floor
oi my ball and iound it covered
with water, dirt, newspapers,

izza boxes, cigar and cigarette
utts, and two or three dozen

beer bottles and cans. Thebath-
room was swamped with trash,
including clothes and bedding
maten'als covered with lilth
and vomit. The administration
has been told all this beiore,
but Dr. Leggctt told me that ho
attributes such complaints most-
ly to a iew good, but weary and
disenchanted, students. Well, i

and disenchanted students, and

hall officer, trying to enforce
rules in a manner compatible
with both orderly hall life and
the freedoms of responsible,
adult students. However, the
liouse councils on which 1
served received no help from
students, faculty, or administra—
tion. Last year, frustrated and
disgusted, l withdrew from the
race for the ball presidency. My
hall now has a very fine presi—
dent, but many members, in.
cluding some hall officers, are
fiercely opposing his efforts to
enforce the rules. Weary and
trusted himself, he has found
that the administration will not
take sides, yet they expect him
to maintain his respect and
authority in his hall,

The tragedy is that the in-
transigeoce and ineptitude of
tl administration severely in.

h‘ it the efforts of such re-
sponsible students to remedy
this situation Most of the men
on North Campus are good stu-
dents, but they need help. How
can student leaders enforce
rules when administration poli—
cy is undefined, arbitrary, and
shrouded by doubletalk? How
can student leaders enforce
rules when the administration
undercuts their position by not
respecting their opinions and
suggestions? How can student
leaders enforce rules which we
all know are unreasonable and
too restrictive? They cannot!
Some have certainly tried, but
when the hopes for needed rule
changes are exhausted, when
the administration ignores the
pleas of good students and im~
plicitly insults our integrity,
then even those few find the
cause a hopeless and thankless
one.

Whether they will admit it
or not, the administrators base

their policies—whatever they
happen to be from time to time
—on the supposition that all
students are basically irrespon—
sible. They seem to think that
some moral depravity underlies
our cries for changes in the
system. They think we have no
commitment to the community,
that our behavior, if there are
substantial rule changes, will
prove intolerable. i am damned
insulted by this, True, some
students will abuse rule chang-
es, but must the majority be
penalized? Most students here
are fairly mature and respoii-'.
ble. These students are now be~
ing alienated from the present
system. As this happens, there
is no immediate check on the
behavior of the deviant few.
They will seek to violate the
rules under any system. The
administration must therefore
better accommodate the good
students and enable them to
handle the unruly few. Give us
your confidence and a system
that we can respect. and we will
prove that we can make this a
good and stimulating place in
which to live and study.

Of course, this requires that
there he a Grinnell community
in which students. faculty, and.
administration are socially and
academically integrated, resolv-
ing community p r o b l e m I
through a deliberative process,
There is not now such a com-
munity, as the recent incident
of student suspensions proves.
The specific case brought to
the surface and reflecled im-
portant community problems
and tensions. Yet, the faculty
abrogated its community
sponsihilities by remaining pi -
fully silent. Far Worse, the ad<
ministration destroyed the most
important elements in such a
community’s social (abric ﬂ
mutual trust and respect. Our
student Government is clearly
the best one we have had in the
past Iaur years. Steve Kent and
his colleagues have distinguish-
ed‘themselves in their respon
his and dedicated efforts to cm
operate With the administration
and to reﬂect programs and
changes conducive to a better
Campus community. Even so,
their thoughtful arguments and
pleas in this case fell on deaf
ears. Now then, how can the ad-
ministration expect students to
abide by unreasonable rules
when respected enforcing offi-
cers have no hope of evoking
understanding from school affi-
cials? If the student leaders
cannot effectively communicatu
with these officials, how are the
rest of us to do so" How
We possibly accept the adnli
tralion as part of a closelyrkuit

Problems arise?

What makes the outcome of
the suspensions so intolerable
is the arbitrariness and vindic~
tive nature of the decision. For
four years, a member of my
hall received tacit permission
to have an illegal car, engaged
in a malicious form of prepping,
physically attacked our hall
president, and frequently eu-
gagcd in illegal opens, The ad
ministration finally suspended
this mediocre student [or a few
days. And now, three good stu-
dents are suspended for a full
semester for a first offense of
much less infamy. Where is the
justice or rationale to this7 I
don't know. My point is that
contrary to the administration’s
pleas, the rules and stated pen-
alties are not so clear-cut and
rigid as to prohibit the milder-
ing or a more equitable penalty.
The hitch is that the apprehend
ed students defended them-
selves in the wrong manner!
they told the truth. Rather than
engaging in the farcical game
of tearful confessions and ex-
punging their consciences of
guilt, they candidly and honest-
ly stated their disapproval of
the present system and its rules.
This was certainly a tactical
mistake, but. the Faculty Com-
mittee on Student Aflairs and
the admlnistration should not
have been so petty and intransi-
gent as to exact an excessively
harsh penalty on this account.
They did, though, and the result

0 is that it is now ever more diffi-

cult to communicate with the
administration in an open and
serious manner, especially in

disciplinary cases. Further, the
apparent accent on retribution
rather than on understanding
and correction is entirely alien
to the ideals of our academic
community. Even the “real"
world, of which our administra-
tors have a passionate fear,
sympathlzcs with this ideal.

What we have, then, is a prets
ty damn good student body
which is indirectly being blamed
and held responsible for the
deeds of the unruly few, yet
we must live in the wretched
conditions they have created be
cause we are not given the con.
fidence and the system with
which we can demand adult be.
havior on their part. Even good
students cannot condone arbi-
trary policy and bad rules. Until
radical change occurs, our social
problem is going to persist as
an obstacle to a good campus
community and academic a.
chievement. The most crucial of
needed changes, however. is
less that of rules and more a
change in the administration’s
attitude toward students. Most
of us are mature and responsi.
hle. We must be treated as such.
We demand a community based
on mutual trust and coiifidenoe,
not on fear, misunderstanding,
and doubletalk. Only with a
community based on cooperat-
ion and consensus can the ad
ministration expect students
forcefully to maintain high
standards of conduct and order.
Good rules and the administra
tion’s confidence and support
would keep more good students
on campus and greatly faoilate
rule enforcement.

In the present situation,
however, even student leaders
can make little or no headway
in talks with school officials.
The student body must now
either resign itself to living
with the problem or resort to
civil disobedience. The former
is intolerable for all or us, the
latter despicable. Meanwhile,
the good students of this school
are disappointed and deinore
alizcd. 1 am so disappointed in
the unruly few and the intran-
sigent administration that, un-
til appr iable changes are
forthcoming, 1 can never recom-
iiiciid this school to other stir
dents or ever give it a penny
of my money. This is a harsh
condemnation coming from one
whu came here proud of Grin-
iicll College. So, beware, ad-
ministration, lest tliis disaffec.
tion with Griiincll spreads
throughout the student body.
Goud students who are well—
ctlucatctl and socially mature
are your product. You have a
fine faculty, but Without good
students you have nothing It
is time that you grow up and
join the adult academic coni-
mlinily and give your good stu-
dents a fair deal. We will wait,
for the decision to be made is
yours alone.

Unfortunately, my class which
will soon depart, leaving not
with anger, but with disillus-
ioiiinent and disappointment.

a social nature. But the suspen-
sions which be upheld were aca-
demic in nature. lie is willing
to see the students “enroll as
Grinnell students in another
college university” but he is
not w‘ ing to have them enroll
as Grinnell students at Grin-
ncll College. For one who was
"not too eager" to give these
students an academic penalty
{or a social violation, he has
forced himself to do an excel»
lent job of it.

What disturhes me about
President Leggett’s decision is
lhat it leaves unclear liis posi-
tion regarding punishment ior
this type of social violation. His
statement seems to imply that
he recognizes the ditierence be-
tween academic and social pun-
ishment, and further that he is
not anxious to mete out the one
where the other is required, But
his action. in upholding the
suspensions, indicates that he
was not willing to apply what
he evidently believes to the
ease in question. This, of
course, leaves open the question
oi inture policy. The president
had an opportunity to establish
a precedent ior tuture action on
cases oi illegal visitation. He
could have done this by issuing
a clearly defined statement and
acting in accordance with it.
That he chose not to do so, es-
pecially at a time when college
policy regarding a number of
social questions is becoming
more and more a matter of gen
eral concern, is regrettable.

Goals Need

Reexu alion
To the Editor:

in his letter last week, Mr.
Crossett raised an important
issue. He in eiiect stated that
we at the college should be
governed by practical reasons,
and l inier that the rules of
the college, and the moral and
social behavir oi the students,
should be to some extent based
on an attempt not to cause the
disapproval oi those who con<
tribute to the college.

Although agree with Mr.
Crossott that we need to con-
lider the practical consequences
of our actions, i believe that
we also need to reexamine the
goals or the college what type
of education is it trying to of-
iei- us? what are the purposes
oi its rules? Does the college
wish to iill our heads with (acts
or does it wish to help us in
our search tor the meaning of
our lives and in our attempt
to establish a satisiactory relac
uonship with society? Certain.
1y we need to he aware of

who ignores these considera~
tions is unequipped to iace so.
ciety. But telling us that society
would eniorce its disapproval
of a liberalization of rules by
decreasing its financial support
oi the college does not help us
understand the reasons for its
disapproval.

Leggett as having taken a stand

search for a moral system. and
have not iound satisfactory ans-

the administration could help

be much more helpful than
just stating that abolishing cer-

Blind to Sex

Says Mother
To the Editor:

The iollowing is part oi a let.
ter i received ironi my mother
this morning:

I became as excited :5 you
when 1 read the account of
the crisis that had arisen at
Crinnellt What a sad story tor
the three students! You may
have guessed t! at my sym.
pathy would be with the stu-
dents. 1 think that the “sys-
tern” is unrealistic and not
completely honest. I tend to
agree with the Editorial irom
your paper, that I am ret
ing ior you to read agai
The students, it seems to me,
are being punished tor being
caught and not really tor the
“act”. Surely the “authori-
ties” know that the students
explore sexual contacts, and
it would seem to me that
their concern should be with
helping the young people
analyze and frankly discuss
the psychological consequenc-
es that may occur with ex.
perimentation, the individual
responsibility toward such be-
haviour and the variety of
attitudes that exist toward
sex. and more and more and
much more, but to keep the
subject open and not to try
and push it under the rug or
pretend that it does not exist
and certainly not to “forbid"
it. in an institution oi learn
ing, and learning is not con.
iined to books alone, a policy
of enlightenment in all phas-
es oi living should be prac-
ticed and as a matter oi fact
encouraged. Students, 1 hope,
are encouraged to probe in
academic arcas, how can they
be so blind , .d rigid in this
particular area oi sex?

_Allanynwus Student

Supports Protest
To the Editor:

1 wish iully to support the
s.G.A. protest against the arbi-
trary suspension of three stus
dents for illegal visitation.
This action demonstrates the
glaring inadequacies oi existing
rules and the gross incompet-
ence oi present eniorcement
policies.

First of all, the administra~
tion rciuscd to consider the
previous record oi the dciend-
ants in exacting the sentence.
None of them hall been in-
volved in other oifenses; at
least one student had a high
academic average Furthermore,
since they were not allowed to
retulll next semester, an acn-
dcmic pllnlshm .it was given tor
a social violation.

Secondly, the administration
had reiuscd to question the ne-
cessity of existing visitation
rules. lt persists in conceiving
authorila-‘an directives as the
proper i~ ponse to human pelt
banality. At the risk or up ' 'ng
the Bilrling monopoly on thlcs,
i would suggest that this utti.
tulle is pl,= ly immoral, Most
oi us are not relativists. We be-

lieve that essential human
rights must be preserved, and
that loi- his purpose certain
rules are required But among
those central irecdoms are the
privacy in our homes and the
dignity oi our personal rela<
tioiiships.

An auth ity which restricts
our opportunity to entertain
guests and elevates private pre-
)utllce to college policy poses
an obvious threat to these hli-
exiles. The regulations intended
to uphold campus “morality”
have thus become a spectacle
of folly.

One would like to dismiss the
Burling Burlesque as a refresh-
ing intermezzo, an amusing
bracer tor the papers and im—
als ahead. The damage to the
careers oi three people renders
this impossible. The implicar
tions oi the sentence are also
bound to create a “credibility
gap" in the administration’s re
lationsliip to the student body,

The rigid eniorcemcnt of a
rule which most oi us no long-
er respect does little to pro
mote the spirit of dialogue and
graduated change. it genuine
communication is to be main-
tained, the authorities must
cease groping m a maze oi end-
less legality and relate to us
as human beings

Grad Comments
To tht Editor:

As a graduate of Grinnell
College I feel that I have both
the privilege and obligation to
comment on the recent events
reg drug the “open dorm"
policy.

I do not to debate wheth-
er the ndm istration's policy
regarding “open dorms” is good
or bad. i desire only to express
my opinion oi the student re-
action to this policy.

1 am entirely in iavor of aca-
demic freedom [or both faculty
and students. However, such
freedom is not inherent in an
in titulion. It must be built,
brl ’ by brick, Step b steDr 0n
a‘strung foundation 0 responsi-
blllty. For, without responsibili-
t)‘, freedom is only another
word for anarchy.

I strongly believe the recent
“demmstration” was the anti-
thesis of responsibility on the
part of those students who par-
ticipated. To openly violate a
policy. no matter how strongly
you disagree with that policy.
is a demonstration of irresponsir
bility not responsibility Not
only is it irresponsible. but it is
also self-defeating, It is selfrde-
(eating because it forces the
administration into an unten-
able posilion.

Any attempt by a group or an
individual to impose its will
upon another group or indivi-
dual must inevitably result in
defeat, (or if the attempt is
successiul you lose the respect
of the ”conquered," while if
the attempt is unsuccessiul you
weaken your initial position,

l implore the responsible stu»
dents of Grinlleli College to
assert your responsibility and
to seize control over your desti»
ny. it you fail to do so now
the grip of irresponsible stu-
dents \liil be too strong, and
such a grip must prove total
not only to you as individuals,
but also to Grinnell College as
an illstituation.

Deans Need

Reevaluation

To the Editor:

Now would appear to be an
excellent time to reevaluate the
traditional roles of the Dean oi
Men and the Dean of Women,
The entire college community
has had reason to be concerned
about the dual responsbllitieo
oi the deans as student counsel»
ors and law eniorceinent oiii-
cers. The recent dismissals of
three students makes all the
more necessary the clarification
at these dual responsibilities.

1 would suggest that a work-
able solution is within our
reach. I propose that the judi-
cal, law enforcing duties oi the
deans be negated. in their place
a council on student alfairs
comprised of faculty, students,
and tlle Associate Dean oi the
College be created. All viola.
tions (excluding petty oifenses
within the hall) at college regu-
latlons would be presented to
this joint body. Decisions oi
this community would be ap-
penled directly to the President
oi the College.

Judicial and law enforcement
duties are a tinlerconsurning
nnd wastetul use oi able coun-
selors oi students. The Dean oi
men and the Dean oi Women.
relieved oi these duties, would
be able to devote their entire
energies to the assistance of
troubled students. Students, no
longer having visions oi the
deans with a police whistle
around their necks, a judicial
mallet in one hand. and a bus
ticket in the other, would have
no fear of consulting with them
on personal problems. Any stu-
dents or iaculty members desir-
ing counseling services ior 0th»
or students would be encour-
aged to consult with the deans.
Students or taculty members
desiring disciplinary action
against students would be im-
mediately directed by the deans
to the disciplinary body, the
community council.

Law enforcement duties off
the campus would continue in
the hands oi public authorities.
The deans' role in cases involv-
ing public authorities would be
that oi advisers to the students.
They would continue in such
tasks as bailing individuals out
of Jail. The only time the Dean
or Men or the Dean oi Women
would ever report a violation
oi a student to the council
would be in an incidence where
they, as representatives oi the
College, were iniornied by pu
lic authorities or private ci
zcns oi a student’s offense. In<
iormation required by the noun»
cll would be obtained through
written or oral testimony oi the
public law enforcement ofii-
cials.

If this system were to func-
tion properly. it would be the
responsibility oi all students
and iaculty members to report
ottenses oi students to the coun-
cil. it would be the charge ot~all
hall presidents and ofiicers to
be eliective law entorcers on
campus, Hall oiiicers and resi-
dent advisers would, in efiect.
be the law enforcement arm of
the community council. In an
atmosphere of clarified policy,
precedents. and the existence of
one, respected judicial unit, we
could look forward to the utili-
zation of that one unit and not
the two or three campus courts
and twenty unofficial “hall
courts” we have at present.

student oiienses that demand
immediate action would be the
responsibility oi an executive
committee oi the community
council comprised of one stu-
dent. one iaaulty member, and
the Associate Dean of the Col-
lege. The President of the
College in such cases, as in all
council decisions, would havo
the power of the veto.

This proposal appears to hi.

to be possible and workable.
-Most importantly it provides
the hope oi an adequate coun—
seling program at Crinnell.
With the addition ofapsycliia.
trist or psychologist on campus
to two deans entirely devoted
to the counseling of students.
Grinnell would be in a much
better position to assist (Tour
bled students. This would no
accomplished, too, by merely
the more eiiectlve utilization
of present members at the com-
munity in roles which they
could ably pcriorm. At the same
time the proposal offers a sim-
pliiication oi iudicial proccdurc
and a community court. What-
ever the case. it is hoped that
creative solutions ulll come
irom these opportune conihcts
of opinion.

Offers Observation
To the Editor:

, l oiier the tollowing observa-
tions on the events or the past
two weeks as a member oi the
primary court. and only ailer
iaving spent nearly live hours
this last Sunday in both for al
and iniorinal discussions \ th
students, faculty. and adm'
tratloll particularly involved
with these events. I must Em-
phasize. however, that l speah
strictly for myseli, and not ne-
cessarily ior any other member
or the court.

It seems to me that the tem-
porary breakdown in coniniui
cation between the student lead-
ers and the administration was
due primarily to an underesti-
mation on the part oi both
sides regarding the integrity of
the other. The administration,
on the one hand. has been un-
iair in regarding the student
grotest as hasty, irrational ex»

ibitionism. The students, on
the other hand, were unfair in
assuming that their disagree-
ment over the administrative
decision regarding the recent
case on campus necessarily sig-
nalled a breakdown in every
form of dissent other than pro-
test. Both sides, it sccms to
me. must assume partial I
sponsibility for the conflict.
But more important, both sides
may now share the credit tor
the constructive results which
i hope may yet evolve from
this near-crisis.

The student demonstration
was in protest of an adminis-
trative decision regarding a spe-
citic issue 7 illegal visitation.
what these students in the pro-
test attempted to do was to
bring the specific issue of il-
legal visitation to the student
court in order that some type
oi guideline would be establish-
ed so far as student handling
ot illegal visitation was con.
cemed.

Two oi the most important
points in the court statement, I
think, deserve a bit of clarifi-
cation. First, these nineteen
student leaders were heard and
judged by the student court in
exactly the same manner, and
with the same attitude. as any
two, live. ten, iiiteen, or nine-
teen students at large would
have been judged; and second,
these nineteen students were,
indeed, given a very spccitlo

enalty — a penalty which has
geen used by the court in the
past, and which will now serve
as a general guideline tor the
student court to use in dealing
with iirst-oiiense. illegal via to-
tlon coming under its jurisdic-
tion in the iuture. The penalty
of a severe warning is vieued
by the court as quite serious,
and says, in eiiect. that ii the
student does not carefully re.
evaluate his relationsliip to
the Grinnell College communi-
ty, and his responsibility to
that community. then he is in
danger oi lacing a minimum
judgment or conduct probation

1 strongly believe that ottt of
the confusion and resulting con-
flict of feelings on everyone:
part these last two weeks, we
can extract something to build
on. Our student leaders’ single
act of protest, and hopefully
the debate over the question
of its advisability, is over. We
can gain nothing by brooding
over what is past; we can gain
much by now working together

Another Berkeley

To the editor:

in these last few weeks the
administration has frequently
suggested that those students
who disagree with their stand.
ords make plans to leave the
college. it would be unfortunate
if the students complied with
the administrations request. it
is often the case that those stu-
dents who protest most vehe-
mently against those policies
which they feel to be wrong are
the same students that care most
deeply about the college.

When one sees that someone
worthwhile is making a mistake,
is it right to do nothing about
1 . The college. an educational
institution, is as deserving of
our efforts. Why give money as
alumni to an institution that one
tailed to try to improve as a
student? Why prop tip an anach.
runism? _

if the administration’s “like it
or lump it.” policy is followed.
Crinnell will soon find itself
with a population of indifferent
students. students that are in-
different about college policy
are less likely to be excited
about anything else. from Dante
to thermodynamics.

In changing an existant pol-
icy it is best to work from with.
in the rule structure. Since it
is not given to the student to
be a dean, the participation of
student government seems called
for. Last week, in an orderly
and constructive way, student
government attempted to right
what they felt to be a severe
wrong. Unfortunately, the col-
lege did not see fit to reward
a Constructive attempt and so
other methods were tried,

students have exhausted every
method. It is to be wondered if,
perhaps the college administra-
tion wants another Berkeley.
One would find it very difficult
to place any other construction
upon their action,

Answers Crosseﬂ'
To the Editor:

In answer to John Crossett,
Associate Professor of Classical
Languages, I would like to
tiuote the words of fiichard T.
LaPiere, in his book, A Theory
of Social Control (p. 353):

. . . innovation requires an

atypical degree and kind of

social isolation, a condition
which might well be described
as social insulation, since it
does not necessarily mean the
lack of normal group mem—
bership. Unless the individual
is adequately insulated from
social controls, he will find
himself, as most men do most

of the time. preoccupied with

andhis time p cmpted by '

status-group acti ties, and he
will be unable to persevere
in the innovative quest. So-
ciety is for the most part
geared'to the maintenance of
routine forms of conduct. Ev-
en in organizations, such as
modern universities, which of-
fically encourage and spon—
sor creative effort, such effort
is often systematically it unin-
tentionally discouraged by
both official and unofficial
demands on the scholars
time and energies.

Perseverance in innovative
endeavor would seem to he a
function of atypical values,
especially those relating to
group membership and status,
and of limited sensitivity to
sympathetic and other normal
demands on the individual’s
time and energies. The illdir
vidual must to a degree at
least put aside the needs as
locally defined, of his wife
and children, the demands of
his occupation, and the inter-
ests of his friends and Her
qualntances, in favor of his
inventive project. lt would
seem that in general success-
ful innovators are character-
istically somewhat rude and
ruthless; but it does not fol.
low that an unteeling and
self~centered egotist neces~
sarily possesses the other at-
tri utes, motivational and otlr
erwisc, which are essential to
innovation. Sociologists have
observed that innovations ape
pear most frequently in those
societies that have a suffici-
ently high standard of living
to provide their members
with the leisure (freedom
from immediate practical
concerns) necessary to work
out innovations; however,
many societies have main
tained in permanent leisure
an entire Class — 8.3., the
scholars of China and the
priests of the Middle Agesi
without profit. Apparently,
therefore, it is not so much
freedom from material want
as freedom front group ohli
gations which, other and
equally essential factors be
ing present. enables an inn
dividual so to concentrate on

a given task that he may
eventually succeed in produc
ing something new.

What LaPicre has said leads
to the conelttsion that some of
“those . . whose vision ex-
tends beyond the problem of
lionlen‘s hours and cars and
open dormitories" must have an

an attempt to expose, honestly,

community. You, on the other
hand, seem to be saying that
differences of opinion should

support a continued policy of
hypocracy. Under this policy

treated as if they were rare
exceptions to the norm of cam-

are not. it is the rules which
represent a misconception of
what the Grinneli student is

Education is not Just the ac-
ceptance of doctrine — social
or academic — but rather the
development of critical and
evaluative abilities. Do you
really propose a system in
which prescriptions are given
and students dutifully gulp
down their medicine? if Grin-

The Two Harvards
To the Editor:

Harvard University seems to
me to faster two alternative
outlooks. In the first place, it
is an institution which prides
and bases itself upon the found.
ations of a timeless (but alas
tiniewornl tradition. It is the
Harvard which takes pride in
itself because it is Harvard and
therefore right (“as right as
right can be," according to w.
5. Gilbert). It is the Harvard
which looks forward to the past.
It is this Harvard which pro.
duces graduates who say,

Those of us whose vision
extends beyond the problem
of women’s hours and cars
and open dormitories can
diagnose the illness.

The approach ls smug, stodgy
and classical. The diagnostic
system is that of llippoerates.
The grammer is impeccable.
The concern is with preserving
this, the best of all possible
worlds. And even it it is not,
it is better not to reevaluate
anyway. since re-evaluation
kicks up ancient dust and fogs
up our spectacles And besides,
we already know what is 'lght
because we have already experi-
enced the world , . , and gone
to Harvard , . . and you haven’t.

There is, however, another
llarvard. This Harvard respects

bases itself not upon the firm
but childish foundations of
blindly accepted dogma, but up-
on a caravan toward progress

R'ucial Problem
T0 Cha Edilo

The events or the last tew
weeks have brought to a focal
point a crisis which has been
building inside us tor quite a
while. What we have to say is
no attempt to speak for all the
Negroes or any other Negro on
the Grinnell campus. Nor is it an
attempt to change anyone's at.
titude.

At this point what bothers us
most is the attitude of white
students who consider them.
selves liberal. We see their LL
heralism as either niisconceived
iiheralisni or h pocricy. The
great majority o the students
here are of a suburban and mid.
dleclass background in which
their contact with blacks is at
most limited. They present the
tact that they have “never had
any trouble with Negroes", as
proot of their liberalism, What
they really mean is that theK
have never had any contact wit
Negroes.

Occasionally one ot them will
have a Negro as a guest in his

Friday. Decemberq, not

hotne. This, too, is allegedly
proof positive oi their total lack
oi preiudice.

We at Grinnell form some
sort or uuasiintellectual elite.
The Negroes are readily “tac-
cepted” by the whites because
they are members of this cliteI
These Negroes are “dlflerent'
trom other Negroes because
they're intelligent and clean.

in the spans of time between
our periods of rapport, we ask
ourselves, “how can we as black
men identity with any of these
whites, while they cannot accept
each and every one'of our black
brothers equally as human
beings.”

Everywhere we look at Grill-
nell we see varying degrees or
racial preiudice in its most sin.
ister form. it is sinister because
no one realizes it, and atter all,
who is going to admit that in
an atmosphere or perpetual in-
tellectual stimulation that any.
thing but racial harmony exists?

As we said earlier, we do not
expect to change anyone's racial
attitude. We have attended ra—
cially integrated e c h o o is
throughout our lives, and this
Eatiem has been consistent. We

ave grown to expect no man
of whites than this racial hypoc-
ricy. what we do wish is that
they would realize their {Elsa
sense of liberalism. Gain
through the motions is no pruu
ot sincere liberalism.

We have been forced to re.
examine our position, the osi-
tion of the Negro in the rin-
nell community. We have come
to recognize our position as one
of implied inferiority which per-
vades every tacet of our daily

Science Prots' Research
. Covers Broad Spectrum

By CHARLES SMITH and ANDY ISAACS

How do Grinnell’s laculty go about fulfilling the college's hopes
that they will devote themselves to scholarly achievement? We
asked the members oi the science departments for this first art-

icle, and the answers were quite
impressive. Virtually every pro-
fessor is engaged in some re
search or writing projects

For example, in the physics
department, Roger Hansen is
currently on leave, experiment-
ing with nuclear specloscopy at
the University of Aarhus in
Denmark. Beryl Clotfelter, the

department head, is studying
conductivity in walls or glass
tubes during electrical dis
charge. He intends to publish
his ﬁndings soon. Bruce Thomas
plans to publish, in conjunction
with the Argonne National Lab-
oratory, a paper on the optical
properties of polystyrenes.
Wayne Denny, having returned
ircm a year in india, is work-
ing on solid state electronics

William Nevill, Chairman of
the chemistry department, has
written a textbook in general
chemistry which will be pub-
lished this winter. He is also
continuing his experiments with
pyrimido (5,4-d)-Dytimidines as
possible anti-carcinogens. Jo-
seph Daniorth, holder or over
thirty patents, is currently in-
vestigating organo—silicon alumi-
num compounds. Luther Erick-
son, with several students, has
been tor the past few years in-
vestigating the interaction of
metal ions with biological signi-
tlcant ligands. Several publica-
tions in nuclear magnetic reson-
ance spectroscopy hear his
name. Jack Swenson, another
patent—holder, is continuing his
studies on the reactions of bro-
momalononitrlle with bases Wil-
liarn Oeike has been studying
the elllects of various cations on
the crystal iormation or sodium
chloride. His laboratory manual
in physical chemistry will be
published soon

in the biology department,
Kenneth Christimsen’s primary
research interest is entomology.
He is currently studying the he-
havioural differences between
dliterent species of Coilembola
(a small arthropod) and the
evolution of some of Collem-
bola‘s cave forms He is also
involved in the revision oi Ne-
arctic members of the genus
Folsomia. Karl T. DeLong is
concerned with vertebrate ec-
ology. He is investigating the
population ecology of rodents,
using laboratory house mice.
Laverns D u r k e e, chairman
of the department and a plant
anatomist, is studying the me-

tory of vegetation since the re«

Petition Decries

Leoders’ Protest

STATEMENT—

Last week, in the turmoil and
confusion following the students
leaders protest, this statement
was circulated on campus ex-
pressing reservations about the
action taken:

We the undersigned wish to
express our reservations re-
garding the action taken by
the AWS Board and mom
on Wednesday night, Novem-
2ard. The tensions of the och
casion and the rapidity of the
proceedings did not allow for
adequate deliberation on the
part or either the student
leaders or the student body:
the facts of the case and the
issues involved were neither
well enough known nor clear-
ly stated; there was confusion
in the forms of the petitions;
and the meeting oi the stu-
dents held in Ann did not.
provide an opportunity for
tormal sanction of the pro-
posed demonstration.

Because or the absence of the
President of the College, all
legal means ol recourse had
not been exhausted. As a re-
sult. the President is being
iorced to deal, under tension,
with a situation which, being
unclear to the student body,
cannot help being unclear to
him.

We hope that this statement
will demonstrate to the Priest.
dent i more deliberative atti-
tudc on the part of the stu-
dents than that suggested by
the actions hitherto taken.

When given to the President,
the total number ol signatures
was 141, about a tenth of the
campus,

Yesterday afternoon two cola
lege classes studying Plato this
semester had a discussion of his
Sympﬂsium with an authority on
classical literature, While she
was sitting in her apartment on
Riverside Drive.

Using the College’s amplilied,
two - day, telecommunication
equipment, the students oi
Greek 312 and Philosophy 317
discussed with Protessor Helen
Bacon ot the Department at
Classical Languages of Colum-
bia University her unique inter-
pretation oi the Symposium.
Through the equipment, her
voice was amplified {or the stu<
dents, as were the questions
and comments they dizected to
her.

Professor Bacon viewed thi!
particular dialogue of Plato as
not so much about love as about
poetry and interpreted it as a
dramatic dialogue rather than a
discursive (realise. Miss Bacon
published this interpretation in
1959 iii the Virginia Quarterly
Review.

By uvm DENAVS
This description of Thailand is continued
from n previous issue of the 58:3. Miss
Dendvs, Grinnell, '65, spent last year teach-
ing in Thailand on the Grinnell Fifth Year
Abroad Program.

As we passed the booths, we were greeted by
shouts from our sludems, all urging us to buy
something ~— anything from them, My feeble
protestations were quickly drowned by their on
thusiasm. l managed to escape only after buying
some roasted nuts, a couple handpainted Christ-
mas Cards for the folks back home (showing View
log palm irees), a bamboo pin in the shape of a
butterfly, and an aerial View of Chiengmai.

We ﬁnally found an empty table where We were
joined by some more friends: Chaw Ying Seda,
a Shsn princess from Burma who also teaches
English at Dara, her brother and sister, and
another Shan friend. John. We all ordered satealr,
a meat dish made of pork or beef, The meat is
usually dipped in a sauce or peanut butter and
coconut milk and eaten with a cucumber.and
vinegar relish, 1 also had kwiiayd nam (noodles
in Water, with meat and vegetables, usually bean
sprouts). With the addition of a few extra ina
gradients such as sugar, soy sauce, mmplaa (fish
sauce), pepper, and crushed peanuts, the dish
was ready to eat. We topped off our meal with
some ice cream and hot Ovaltine, another Thai
favorite,

Jungjut glanced at his watch. it was nearly
nine o‘clock — time to get started it we wanted
a good view of the parade. After paying our hill,
we made our way through the noisy holiday
crowd until we reached the badge. The View
was magniﬁcentl To our right, through the cur~
tain of trees lining the river bank, we could see
the shimmering lights of Dara, Straight ahead,
at the distant bend of the dark n'ver, tiny lights
melted and flowed into a stream of gold. Elabor-
ate ﬂoats resembling miniature temples and
boats passed under the bridge, as well as simp-
ier ones made of bark, banana leaves, or paper.
A firecracker exploded nearby. We moved on,
and once more, became part of the surging
crowd.

Ying touched my arm and pointed to a cluster
of people on the bridge, Even at times of festivity
and fun, one can ﬁnd a note of tragedy. A small
boy had fallen through a hole in the bridge and
drowned. For one family, anyway, this Loy Kra-
thong was not a time of joy but of sorrow.

By now, we had crossed the bridge. The street
ahead of us — and the surrounding area —— wns
tightJy packed with people, all anxiously await<
ing the start of the parade. People, people every
where , . , 1 never knew there were so many
people in Thailand, let alone in Cbiengmai. Acts
ually, many of them were visitors who had come
just for the iestivnl. Loy Krathorlg (and many
other festivals) are best seen and celebrated in
Clllellgmai. Thousands of Tllélis from miles
around, even as for as Bangkok, charter buses
and jam uno the hotels (luring llic onuuul inn-s
and festivals, ll's hectic, bill “is Thais seem to
love every minute ol it.

1 spied a couple Dara teachers on a balcony
with an excellent View of the Coming parade.
After ii‘anlic motlolnngs, they saw us and waved
{or us to join them. The owner of the shop es-
corted \IS upstairs where we removed our slides
before entering the llvmg area and the balcony.

The parade, with its huge linens and various
native bands, is a high point in the two-day les-
iivities. Many organizations, clubs, and larger
shops compete in presenting the most beaulilul
and original float. These floats are than actually
launched on the Mae Ping River and float downs
stream past the judges’ stand _ one every 20 or
30 minutes. There were floats representing ani-
mals and depicting Thai legends, A Chinese tire
breathing dragon wound lts way down the street.
There were also floats of a more serious nature
showing agricultural machinery 7 and new wea-
pons, The armed forces contributed to the dc-
casion with a iloot dcpicling military prepared
ness, but also showing the determination of the
Thai people to stand for world peace. The huge
missile on the SEATO float actually fired its
“rockets", creating huge puffs oi billowing grcy
smoke and almost shattering n iew ear drums

along the way. Arid, as in parades everywhere,
beautiful young girls smiled and waved to the
crowds, and were greeted with whistles and
shouts of approval in return,

As the last float disappeared from view, the
crowds began to disperse in search of more an
terlainment and sanuk. Jungjut and his friend
went to play a game of ping pong, while Ying
and I decided to continue through town, heading
for the New Bridge further north. As we ducked
through the crowds, we were thankiul not to
have to ﬁght the usually heavy motorized traffic.
The streets are generally jammed with three-
wheeled taxis and pedicabs, buses, cars, jeeps,
tniclrs, oxcarts, bicycles, and hondas, which go
careenlng crazily down the street, paying abso-
lutely no attention to common sense rules of
safety. The pedestrian is just as bad. How any-
one manages to stay alive in Thai trafﬁc
(whether Bangkok or Chiengmai) is beyond my
understanding. During the festival, however, the
police had blocked off all the main streets and
roads near the river.

Quite a crowd had collected in front of the
government sold or pavilion where another show
was in progress. Half a dozen girls were dancing
the Chiengmai “Nail” Dance, while to the right,
on educational film on hill tribes was being
shown. Music from several bands filled the all,
and a singer crooned a popular Thai love song
into the microphone. Ying and I passed bright,
cheerful shops where customers could be heard
bargaining over goods. Young children played on
the floor, and friends passed the time in amiable
conversation. We were greeted by many of our
students and introduced to their parents and
lriends. They all wished us a wonderful Loy
Krathnng and hoped that l‘d be in Thailand long
enough to enjoy many more.

Ying Seda and I took a side street which looked
inviting, The alley was dark, save for hundreds of
small flickering candles placed around balconies
and on window sills. Here and there, a ray of
light shone from a window or slipped under a
door. I closed my eyes and could almost hear
the soft crunch of soft snow underfoot . . . the
tinkle of tiny bells , , . and the sound 01 children’s
voices singing “Silent Night”. As we walked
along, Ymg, a Buddhist, felt. an equal serenity
and beauty.

At last, we Came to an old Buddhist temple or
Wat surrounded by thick grey walls. We walked
through the gate, guarded by two ilerce lion-
dogs, and beheld a most beautiiul sight. Tiny
lights winde and flickered out of the darkness
like mischievous eyes. They sparkled on tile
chodi or reliquary and on the stairs and on The
naga (serpent) balustrades, They even danced
on the various some images or demons and ani—
inols which dotted the courtyard, Sevcral wor-
shipers were placing rheir candles on the billu-

c hciorc enlel'lng the w' an, the principal
n..t building where the public gathers on holy
tlnys. inside llie nihan, pricsls rll‘onctl their an-
Clellt, snot-ed Sanskrit and roll scriplurcs. To
this rlzly, their deep and monolouous cliontiug
never fails to send a slight slnver down my spine.
Ying bought a candle, sevcrul incensc sticks, and
a small bouquet of red and yellow gcl‘beras. Afr
ler removmg our shoes, we entered the \viharl.
she placed her offerings on the shrine already
blazing with candles and fragrant with incense.
As she prayed, I glanced around me. Upon a
raised throne in the center of the far wall, facing
the entrance, loomed the great gilded bronze
image of the Buddha, it seemed part of the
building itself. It dominated the whole interior,
peacelul, composed, and calm. To the lelt. upon
a low raised platform, sat a group or orange-
robed priests, oblivious to the comings and
goings or the worshipersJ tell under the spell of
the moment a the droning of the priests, the
fragrance of incense, the ﬂickering lights, and
the gentle, benevolent Buddha, smiling down upon
the prostratlng worshipers.

Ying and I slipped out quietly. Outside, we were
lreated to another pleasant surprise. A huge
lounialn oi sparks shot up into the air with a
“whoosh” and a blaze of light, It ﬂared and
sparkled in all its splendor and then, just as sud-
denly, died, leaving only a burned-out shell. We
nodded, and walked through the gate, We found

 

two taxis near the new bridge,
and said goodbye. People were
slowly returning to their homel.
after another beautiful My
Kralhong. This was to be my
last. The cold night air farmed
my face in a gentle farewell
caress. The palms swayed and
rustled softly in the moonlight.
It was 3 am. and, in another
few hours the dawn of another
new day.

Hebrew Taught By
Sophomore Student

“it's like 8 branch on a tree,"
said the instructor of 3 new
course at Grinnell. He was re;
terring to a class in beginning
Hebrew grammar which grew
out of Mr. Crossett's Bible
class. The teacher is sopho-
more student James A. Arietl
and the class membership is
based solely on interest. The re-
ply has been “more than eu-
thusiastic“ said Arieti. The
class now numbers about 15,

This course gives no credit,
being offered purely in the in-
terest of scholarship. Interest
in it developed because of prob-
lems which arose out of am-
biguities in translation. Goal of
the class is to develop the abili-
ty to read the Old Testament in

the language in which it was
written,

PPPE Book Tells
Washington Jobs

Attention was focused on the
possibilities for employment in
Washington, D.C. this coming
summer, in a manual prepared
and distributed by the Program
in Practical Political Educa-
tion this week.

'The employment opportuni-
ties both in congressional of-
fices and in Federal agencies
and installation in the metro
politan area or the Nation’s
Capital are outlined in the
PPPE manual.

The importance of early ac-
tion in making application for
such summer assignments in
Washington is emphasized, since
in the case of the congressional
internships there is intense com-
petition for a limited number
oi positions and since in the
case oi the positions with Fed-
eral agencies a passing score
on either the Office and Scie
ence Assistant Examination or
the Federal Service Entrance
Examination is required. And
the final filing date for ad
mission to both of these test:
is early in January.

A copy of the PFPE manual
may be obtained from C. Ed-
win Gilmour (pol. sci.), PPPE
Director in Room 213, Camegie,

ten request.

Pioneers Drop [age Opener

Meet Rugged Knox
Here Tomorrow

By STEVE CASEY

The Pioneers dropped their
opening tilt to Luther last Sat-
urday but coach Plitsch was
not terribly discouraged by the
game, Both teams made the
usual number of mistakes for
an early season game. but Lu-
ther's superior rebounding and
shooting gave them the 9142
Victory.

Coach Ptitsch mentioned that
Luther’s starting lineup of last
year that won the lows Confer-
ence championship was intact
and included two all-conference
performers plus a second team
pick. “We will not face a team
that is better personnel-wise
this year,” he said. “They were
too last and neutralized our at-
tempt at a running game. We
were also overcommittlng our-
selves on the offensive board:

which allowed them to get too
many iast breaks."

All the statistics tavored Lu<
ther. They easily outrebounded
the Pioneers 58-39 and Shot 44
per cent from the iield to 39
per Cent tor the Pioneers.

One thing the Pioneers must
improve on is their shooting.
Pfitsch mentioned that the Pie—
neers have to be shooting
around 45 per cent to make up
tor the deticiency in rebound-
ing. He noted that the Pioneers
stayed with Luther pretty well
in the second halt when they
shot over 40 per cent. Although
the Pioneers many times took
a long shot when they possibly
could have set up a closer one,
Pfitsch was not concerned. “We
are trying to gel the quick shot
anyway we can and all shots
the players think they have a
decent: chance on should be
taken."

0n rebounding Pfltsch said
the Pioneers rebounded well tor

their size but it should improve,
especially on the defensive
boards.

Considering all facets ol the
game, Piitsch was relatively
satisfied with the effort and
feels that if this team shoots
45 per cent, they will be in any
game.

Tomorrow night at 7:30 the
Pioneers will open the content
