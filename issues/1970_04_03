Facull'y Poll on S’ruden'l'

Representatives oi the Scarlet
and Black have conducted an
opinion poll among the faculty
of the college to ascertain the
reaction to the proposal oi the
Committee on Curriculum and
Academic Affairs, the text or
which appeared in the last issue
of the newspaper. These opinions
are presented here without
comment for the information of
the Griiinell College community:

Gerald V. Lalonde, Classical
Languages: “Basically it will be
a debate of who is going to run
the school, 1,] for one, still Credit
nie‘phlioso’phy underlying the
constitution of this College, and
any number of other institutions,
in delegating power on the basis
of certain credentials and ex
pcrience, Consequently I am
opposed to any measure which
will weaken or alter the present
status oi the iaculty in the
legislative process of the College.
One of the responsibilities of the
faculty in legislating curricular
and academic affairs is to
provide the most eiiicient
possible channels for student
opinion and to give this opinion
very serious consideration.
ironically, the referendum beiore
the faculty proposes to achieve
this rapport by abrogating the
very legislative power on which
this responsibility is promised.
But the proposal as i see it, with
the mutual veto power of students
and iaculty, and the possibility
ot a breach in the cooperative
relationship oi the faculty and the
President, is potentially less
efficient and more disruptive
than the present state of affairs,
Fortunately, these are not the
only alternatives, The proposal
in question has a number of
commendable points which could
be maintained satisiactorily by
the amendments to be proposed
by Mr. Goldberg i trust that this
will be theoutcome.”

Robert Grey. Political Science:
lam in essential agreement with

the proposal of the Betts come
mittee My support emerges
irom the proposition that
academic decisions should
reflect both the interests of the
educated and whatever special
competence exists in the come
niunity as to what these interests
are and how they may best he
realized Although there are
ditficulties in drawing boun-
daries between areas in which
various groups have competence
and areas in which they do not,
and comparable difficulties in
ascertaining who has most
competence in an area, I find the
Bctts committee’s distinctions
between departmental and allr
college curricular matters the
most satisfactory, albeit vague,
boundary line, Faculty members
have received substantial
training, done substantial
thinking, and conducted research
in their disciplines. This
background gives them a com-
peteiice in departmental matters
which should be reﬂected in
decisions at that level. They have
no comparable background, and
thus no special competence, on
all campus curricular matters.
Since our monopoly oi decision-
making at this level is unjustified
by special competence, and I
know of no other compelling
justiﬁcation, I support student
participation in these decisions.

Honorary Degree

Herbie Hancock is a former Grinnell student
and, though still a young man, one of the most noted
Jazz musicians in the country. He has accepted an
invitation from CBS to come to Grinnell to help
commemorate Black Martyrs’ Day. '

At their last meeting before spring vacation,
the faculty overwhelmingly voted to give Hancock
an honorary doctorate. There were only two dissent—

ing votes. Dean Wall, in presenting the motion."

said that the proposal had been brought to him by
CBS. It remains only for the proposal to be present-
ed to the trustees. .

The faculty vote leads us to question the value
of the honorary degree given by Grinnell College.
We do not dispute Hancock’s considerable accom-
plishments and talents in the field of music, Han-
cock, however, is barely thirty years old. Further-
more, though he spent four years at Grinnell, he
never earned a degree. Tile honorary doctorate
should be a noble token of praise given to a man for
a lifetime of service and excellence in a particular
field. The apparent zeal with which the faculty voted
to give Hancock the degree indicates to us that they
were perhaps more interested in pandering to the
desires of a minority than maintaining the high
standards of the honorary degree.

In the past, the College has given honorary de-
grees to presidents, congressmen, and distinguished
scholars. Several years ago, we also awarded an
honorary degree to the last great black martyr, the
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King. To give Hancock the
same honor as King is to either degrade the greater
man or exalt the lesser. Either alternative speaks
ill of the memory of King and the dignity of Grinnell

College.

Milovctn Djilos

We note with considerable interest the silence
on campus concerning the matter of Milovan Djilas’
cancelled visit. Djilas was unable to deliver the Ros-
enfield Lectures at Grinnell because the Yugoslav»
ian government, which has twice imprisoned Djilas,
has revoked his passport. This outrageous action has
as yet occasioned no official protests and no letters
to the 58:8.

The Committee on international Studies, the
sponsors oi the lectures, issued a bland statement in
which they said Djilas “is unable to come to this
country from Belgrade at this time.” The secretary
of the committee has stated that he was not officially
apprised of the reason for cancellation when the no-
tice was sent out. He said, however, that the com-
mittee had no plans to protest the actions of the
Yugoslavian government.

We deplore the repressive policies of the Yugo-
slavian government. And we cannot help but won-
der at the motives of those who condemn totalitar-
ianism on the right, while they rationalize or ignore
its existence on the left,

Editors’ Note: At the last moment we received a letter

from President Leggelt to the Yugoslavian embassy which
may be found in the Letters,

SCARLET AND BLACK

The Nature of a Liberal Education: Par’r 4 )Moiiyrs
The Development of Hie Mind is Discussed

in the development of the mind
we have included a Career, the
development oi the intellect, and
the appreciation oi the arts Each
oi these requires a discussion;
first, let us consider a career.

Some careers are purely
technical and require knowledge
and-or skill mainly within a given
iield, e,g,, surgery, physical
education, and the teaching oi
mathematics, or of a language
(not including literature). Others
require an added knowledge oi
a variety of related Iields for
their completion, e.g., drama,
economics, politics, law,
philosophy; tor a good dramatist
must have strong insights into
human nature and be somewhat
oi a philosopher; a good
economist must be sufficiently
informed of political theory,
practice, and tendencies; and a
good lawyer needs logic,
psychology, and knowledge of
human nature. In general, the
more a career becomes com-
prehensive, the more it requires
a iorm or a proper ordering or
its various elements tor its
completeness; and as it becomes
more complete, it becomes more
successful and so adds more
enjoyment to its activity, '

A career is a dominant or the
dominant part ot a man’s ac-
tivity; and since interest in a
career contributes a great deal
to one’s happiness, the proper
choice of it becomes a matter
of importance. Some students
decide early on a career and do
not change their minds. Others,
due to a variety oi interests or
a change or mind, need time to
get acquainted with a number oi
iields before making the proper
choice; and an institution which
allows them this time and en-
courages them to be exposed to
a number of ﬁelds is more likely
to contribute to that choice.
There are also those who do not
know what they want, and with
time these too may iind what they
want. The decision on a career,
then, should not be hastened by
iullilling requirements early;
and while most students decide
by the end or the second year
in college, a iew need more time
and should not be left to those
who know less (eg, to the
student), but should be deter-
mined by those who know more
(i.e., by the experts in each
lield). Such rhetorical phrases as
“relaxing or liberalizing the
requirements," “the student
knows what is best for him,”
“keeping up with thetimes,““it's
time ior change," are slogans or
coniusions and not arguments. So
while colleges may iind it ad-

visable to make changes ior
practical reasons, such changes
must be tactical and not
strategic, Strategic changes
must be made mainly because
of theoretical considerations As
tor the argument that
requirements should be lessened
to make a liberal education
possible tor a greater proportion
oistudents entering colleges, and
that the better students will
choose or be advised to choose
what is best ior them anyway,
this substitutes chance and
mediocrity for excellence and
may postpone what is needed,
thus cheating the able student.
So While some colleges with low
standards need this argument ior
survival or for bettering the
education of disadvantaged
students, the better colleges
should avoid it altogether if a
liberal education is to be such
as already deiined.

The problem of whether a
Career should be part of a liberal
education or not, is also resolved
by what has been said; tor the
more a career requires elements
from other fields for its per»
iection and proper eiiectiveness,
the more its own technical
aspects become only matter tor
a higher iorm. But the aim oi
a liberal education is happiness,
which includes an ordering of
pleasures, and one oi these is a
dominant or the dominant and
is present in a career. Hence a
career, especially when it
requires elements rrom other
fields, should be a part of a
liberal education.

The next problem is the
development or the student’s
intellect, or of his general in-
telligence, if you wish, and it is
concerned in a general way with
our present civilization, what it
is, how it has come to be, and
where it tends to be going and
should be going; and one might
call this “the history cl our
present civilization.” Man is a
political animal, to be sure, aiid
his “human vector” has (a) a
slariing point: the distant past
(1)) a quantity’ the orderly suin
tolal oi his development up to
the present, and (c) a direction:
an ideal goal or its promise in
the future, and to understand
himseli and where he is going,
in general he should have some
knowledge oi these parts, The
two parts of our present
civilization are its being and its
becoming. Its becoming is the
historical movement and the
ordered accomplishments up to
the present, with some intimation
of the future; that of its being
includes the general principles

and truths which we regard as
constituting the nature oi our
present civilization. The terms
“static“ and “dynamic,” or
“permancncc” and “change”
have often been used for “being”
and “becoming.”

Knowing nothing about the past
is to some extent like starting
over again and making the same
mistakes; and trying to learn
everything about it leaves no
time [or progress. So there should
be a sense oi proportion and a
golden mean, limited to what is
outstanding (truth, goodness and
beauty) and studied in a general
way and not intensively Man’s
becoming, then, is man's history
since the dawn of civilization, and
it should include its main
aspects: political, economic,
intellectual, artistic, and
religious; and the study oi this
should be part of a liberal
education, Part of the material
tor this should be direct sources,
ior works oi great men cannot
be achieved with the same
adequacy and accuracy by lesser
men The integration (ti-historical
sources, on the other hand,
always remains a problem, and
one may use what seems the best
available; tor example, Ranr
dall’s “The Making of the Modern
Mind” was Successfully used for
this purpose for a liumbcr of
years,

As [or the other part, the being
or our present civilization, it is
concerned with art, science, and
method, regarded as permanent
contributions or almost so, being
also to some extent good for
everyone to know. Every
scientist or artist should have
some training in the general
prerequisites of his special
science or art; and all others,
businessmen and lawyers and
bankers and the rest, would
derive some beneﬁts from such
prerequisites or “logical"
training Such a course may be
called ”methodology,” and it is
concerned with the principles of
any science (the nature oi
science, or logic and scientiiic
methods) and those oi any art
A scientist, tor examplc, should
have a deiinitc idea of the nature

The History of Henry Wilhelm and

PnrtOne

ByMarkSabieman
Five years ago, both Henry
Wilhelm and Krystyna Neuman
were students at Grillnell College
who pursued their studies and
other interests not too differently
trom other students, Henry was
a second semester freshman
when he went to Selma, Alabama
in March of 1965 to cover Dr.
Martin Luther King’s civil rights
march to Montgomery tor the
Scarlet and Black. Krystyna,
then in her sccond year at Grin

nell, shared with Henry an in '

latest in publications and a devo-
tion to liberal and radical causes;
in fact, she was to take the next
year off from school in order to
work with the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference in Chica~
go,

Yet all was not really so calm
in that spring term of 1965 as
it might have seemed then. For
when the FacultyStudent Board
of Publications selected John
Phillips and Henry Wilhelm as
the editors for the 1966 Cyclone,
the stage was set for a serious
conflict between Wilhelm and the
College, a conflict that would last
much longer than either would
have expected or hoped for,

That 1966 yearbook, as most
Grinnell students and faculty
know, was never published, ale
though Wilhelm put in a year and
a half of work into it, and flunked
out of school in the process. The
college refused to publish it,
because it was afraid some of
the pictures and copy in the book
7 for example, pictures at a pot~
party a might leave the college
open to libel suits.

Wilhelm did not leave Grinnell
after he flunkecl out of school and
after the college gave him back
the proof pages of the yearbook,
he stayed and opened up the East
Street Gallery of Photography in
his father's old house at 1408 East
Street. in 1957 Krystyna Neuman
joined him and they have been
living together there since then.

In the past lew years, Henry
and Krys, along with various
friends — Susie Kaeser, Richard
Schneirov, Steve Raitt, John
Phillips, Bob Hodierne, Larry
Frank, Kit Leder, and Ken Shai-
ness 7 who have lived at me
East Street Gallery with them,
have been involved in various
ways with the college and the
community.

Either Henry or Krys or both
has been a party to a civil suit
against the state or lowa, a civil
suit against Grinnell College. a

addition, they have filed com-
plaints when townspeople have
harassed them. For two indir
viduals who are often looked on
as “hippies” of “radicals," or as
Krys Neuman would say,
“freaks," they have an una
expected tamiliarityavith, and in
manﬁzways, a tali'th in, the
Amcrican judicial system.

Both of them — Wilhelm
especially a are very good ar~
listic photographers, although
recently they have tried to de-
emphasize their photography
except as a creative process
which gives them individual en-
joymentanosatislaction

They have a patent on a special
kind of photographic print
washer and another for a film
washer, designed especially forl
prolessionals who are interested
in print and negative per»
manence. Henry and Krys‘
produce these film and print
washers in their basement at the
East Street Gallery, and all of
the money from sales goes to run
the Gallery, which may describe
as a “noncompetitive
cooperative community.”

With respect to Henry and
Krys, the town of Grinnell might
be described a “non-cooperative
community.” Many townspeople
— and this includes a good
number of college professors 7
feel that Henry and Krys and the
East Street Gallery are a bad
inﬂuence on the community.
Many would like to see them
leave. .

Not all townspeople or college
laculty members feel this way,
of course Some, like Professor
Bernard Mergen (History), see
them as a positive inﬂuence on
the community and on students
and think it would be very un-
fortunate it the college and town
harassed them into leaving.

hence of the general nature of
a science, If a science is defined
as “universal knowledge which
starts from principles (concepts,
axioms, deiinitions, and hypo—
theses). arrived at by sensation,
abstraction, induction, etc, and
proceeds by reasoning to
theorems,” then a scientist
should have an adequate
knowledge of the terms of this
deiinition and their properties
and also oi the general
procedures in a science. A
lawyer, too, needs the principles
of logic to some extent. Similar
remarks apply to the principles
of any art, though little is said
about it in a methodology course
nowadays,

Now since the abstract is often
empty without the concrete, or

the importance of the accurate
selences lies more in their ac
curacy and their being close to
an ideal of whatascierice should
be, that of the less accurate lies
more in the fact that they are
concerned also with values. For
want of better terms, We may
call the more accurate sciences
“physical" or “natural" and the
less accurate “social." Then
perhaps two sciences should be
required, one physical and one
social, each presented in a
manner less technical and more
general than that for majors. A
student majoring in a natural
science need not take a course
in another natural science as a
requirement; and the same
applies to any major.

As for an exemplification of an
art, this comes under “the ape
precia'm of the arts,” which
lnclud a variety of ﬁelds
(music, paintings, sculpture,

since “the universal does not
exist apart irom the particular,”
some exemplification of the
nature of science and of art is
advisable. 0f the sciences, some
are very accurate (mathematics,
physics, chemistry, biology),
others are less so (the social
selences). The former use
relatively few principles, the
latter use more numerous. The
accurate sciences are concerned
mainly with matters at fact, the
less accurate sciences tend to
include values as well. sowhile

literature, drama, etc). A
foreign language as a
requirement should be limited to
its literature; for one who wishes
to take such a course as an
exemplitication of an art should
enter college With knowledge of

Edward Foster, English: I
believe the proposal is phil-
osophically and educationally
unsound Not only would it give
to students a power in decision-
iiiaking improper to their role at
the institution, but it would also
compromise the faculty’s present
power to recommend policy in
cooperation with the President,
Moreover, the proposal promises
to be unwieldy in practice. The
proposal committee seems well
designed only ior the speciiic
task of eliminating general
requirements. lwoulol regret that
functioll and can foresee no other
function with any prospect of
success,

L, H. Durketﬁtology: I am
in favor oi it, (the proposal) but

to give up part of my teaching
load to serve on the committee.
At llle same time I cannot think

Peter Bowman, Physics:

Who plight to determine the
general curriculum? The
President? The Faculty? The
Students? My thinking on this
question is swayed by my
thinking on another, closely
related question: On what
grounds should the first question
be decided? Precedence?
Competence? involvement?

Those who say precedence,
whether they cite local practice
or that oi our sister institutions,
are guilty oi fallacious reasoning,
it seems to me. For they are
inlerring from iactual situations,
what has been done in the past
or what is being done at present,
to an evaluative conclusion, what
ought to be done in the future.

Those who say competence use
sounder reasoning 7 but argue
from false premise. They assume
that the President and the

do not, But. is this true? recent
evcnts both near and iar argue
that it is not: the failure of the
Grinnell curriculum adopted just
two years ago, the WASP-
oriented ethnocentricity oi
curricula all over the country, the
overproduction of PhD s, etc. It
seems to me that the Faculty and
the President are no more
competent than the Students to
dccide on the general
curriculum.

What’s left? On what other

, grounds than involvement can we
decide the question at issuei
None that I can think of, The only
legitimate consideration is a
straightforward one at who‘s
involved in the curricular process
itself, the process of Faculty
teaching students. And to what
conclusion does this clone
sldel‘ation lead7 To the con-
clusion that those who are
directly involved in the general
curriculum ought to determine it.
That the Faculty ought to
cooperate with the Students in
doing so 7 not with the
President, as the Trustees By-
Laws currently allow, And that
the By-Laws ought to be modified
accordingly.

feel that the curriculum proposed
by that group and subsequently
approved by the faculty was,
although reasonably sound, ens
tll’ely too flexible, The document
itseli was a set of closely coor~
dinated proposals, each at}
companied by a corresponding
rationale. It attempted to solve
certain problems and answer
certain criticisms by setting up
appropriate detailed curricular
and administrative structures
(e.g., the Upperclass General
Education Requirement and
Divisional Educational Policy
Committees). The effectiveness
ot these structures varies widely,
but the whole approach was
entirely too legalistic, in my
opinion. I’m afraid that the
current proposal errs in the same
direction.

jective of the proposal; l.e., to
involve students more closely in
curricular decision making
processes, However, I do not
iavor the mechanism proposed.
In my opinion, the number oi
committees and other bodies
which must approve a proposed
change needs to be reduced
rather than increased, A
proliferation of committees will
solve no problems. Nor am i
convinced that the approval of
the entire student body should be
required for any changes in
general requirements. On the
contrary, i believe that the
desired objectives can be
achieved within our present
structures,

To achieve greater student in-
tluence in general curriculum
matters, [suggest the following
changes- (1) equal represen»
latlon by faculty and students on

include regular consideration of

role of the Executive Collnc‘i to
permit its members (especially
the EPC chairmen) to play a
more important role in
curriculum matters.

iii the objective is to achieve
specific curricular reforms, I
believe that the above changes
could substantially increase the
likelihood of such reforms. If the
objective is student power ior
student power‘s sake, the
preceding analysis and
suggestions are completely
irrelevant.

“Essentially my view is that
students have an appropriate role
in advising faculty on

responsibilty oi the iaculty to
make final decisions.

very much in favor of the method
that this proposal initiates, that
is, an attempt to deiine the areas

ministrative concern and
legislate functions accordingly.
This approach makes a lot more

proposals of having student

wanted to make the yearbook in
the style of a continuous photo
essay, done completely in “photo-
journalistic style."

In this way, they hoped to
convey an objective, “Cultural"
view of what Grinnell College
was like in 1966 7 a view that
would be intelligible to an out-
sider who did not know Grinnell,
and to the students themselves
when they looked back in later
years. To this end, Wilhelm and
Phillips spent most of their time
as students taking pictures 7
twenty thousand in all. They
devoted so much time to their
iobs as yearbook editors that they
were unable to keep up with their
work as students; Phillips
iiunked out almost right away,
and Wilhelm followed him some
whatlater.

Ordinarily the yearbook would
come out in October of the follow-
ing school year; however Wil»
helm did not have it completely
organized and ready to send to
the printer until April of 1967.
When Wilhelm finally sent the
manuscript to the printer, it
appeared to most people that the
long delayed 1966 yearbook would
finally come outin May of 1957.

There was, however, further
delay. The printer, the American
Yearbook Company, found the
content of “Grinnell College
1966” a “major departure from
what is usually found in college
yearbooks" and, possibly,
libelous. The printer notified

President Leggett and asked for
a statement from him releasing
the firm from responsibility if
any libel suits were to result from
the yearbook. President Leggett
then asked for the return of the
manuscript to him, and, when it
arrived, he gave it unopened to
the college lawyer, John F,
Bierman of Grinnell to look over,

According to Dean Joseph
Wall, then Chairman of the
faculty, no one at the college
looked at the manuscript since
they wanted there to be no basis
for anyone to say that it was
censorship. Bierman, after
examining the manuscript, found
that it did contain some grounds
for libel, and he advised Leggett
not tosignarelease.

The President then notified the
Committee on Publications, and
it met and told Wilhelm, who had
not known of the return of the
manuscript to the college, of the
situation. At a second meeting,
the committee approved a pro
posal that it would go through
the material with the lawyer
present, and, at each part which
was deemed libelous material,
would either redo the part or
delete it Otherwise, the com-
mittee agreed the college would
not publish the yearbook.

Wilhelm refused this offer; he
considered it nothing else but
Censorship, Instead, he made his
own after to the College, that his
lawyer would negotiate with the
college‘s lawyer. The college,

howeve , would not accept that
offer; president Leggett and the
Board of Publications though:
that Wilhelm had no preorgative
to have his own lawyer. In their
View, the Board of Publications
was the publisher of the yearbook
and Wilhelm, as editor, was an
employee ofthe Board.

Leggett told the site that he
did not think “censorship" was
the essential problem with the
yearbook. He said that, although
he realizes some people think the
college reiuscd to publish the
yearbook because it presented an
unfavorable view of the school,
this was not the case. Leggett
said that he “tried to keep the
thing on the ground of libel rather
than censorship," He said that
the committee’s offer to Wilhelm
did not involve censorship since
the committee was publisher,
and “a publisher cannot censor

his own material. 7' _
When the college finally

decided it would not publish the
yearbook, it handed the manu
script over to Wilhelm and paid
back the people who had bought
subscriptions at $6 apiece. After
this, Wilhelm said he would pubs
lish the yearbook independently
of the college, and he sold a new
set of subscriptions at $10 per
book The book has not as yet
been published, although all the
type has been set and photo-
graphic negatives for the offset
plates are made. Wilhelm was
not satisfied with the quality of
the first offset plates made, and
is planning to have them partially
made over when he gets enough
money, The work already done
on the yearbook represents an
investment of $9,000; all that
really remains to be done alter
new ofiset negatives are made
of the pictures is the actual print-
ing.

yearbook, altllough unavoidable
trom the college’s standpoint,
was unfortunate because it
deprived the community ot what
was a new, creative kind of year-
book and because it alienated
Wilhelm from the college. To
others, the controversy was not
only untortunate [or the college
and its image and Wilhelm but
itwas also unnecessary.

Willlelm thought that libel was
not really an issue in the year
book controversy; the lawyer
that he retained at this time was
or the opinion that there was no
libel in the yearbook. In Wil~
helm’s mind, it was a case of
censorship by President Leggett,
since the yearbook was, ac-
cording to Wilhelm, “critical of
Leggett personally,” and
because it. presented an “ab

iectlve, complete report oi the
college that wasn't quite with the
public relations image or the
college.” The college's action
then, Wilhelm. says, was “an
absolute smear to try to save its
own reputation, and absolutely
despicable."

There are apparently many
faculty now who, looking back on
the situation in 1967, would agree
with Wilhelm that the yearbook
should have been published as
Wilhelm made it originally.
These faculty members and
Wilhelm seem to think that, if
the same kind oi situation oc
curred today, the college would
be forced to act diiterently. Then,

Gap , Bu , and Mixed:
Winter Sports Wrap-up

Swimming:

The Midwest Conference
Championship meet wound up the
most successful season in
Grinnell swimming history and
was the most noticable feature
of a generally dull winter season
for Grinnell sports. Coach nay
Obcrmiller termed the team
performance in the loop meet
“ .the greatest team effort I
have ever witnessed,”

The individual performances in
the meet were of sufficient
quality to merit national at-
tention, and accordingly 6
Grinnell Swimmers were invited
by the NCAA to compete in the
College Division Meet in
Rochester, Mich. Four swim-
mers, Rollins, Daley, McBlain.
and Carns, came out of the meet
on March 21 with Alermerican
laurcls.

Rollins tied his own school
record of 22 2 sec, to cop a third
place finish in the 50 yd
freestyle. In a close finish, ht
took sixth place in the 100 yd
freestyle at 49 seconds even.

All four All-Americans com-
peted as a team in the freestyle
relay. The team came in ninth,
qualifying with a time of 3:193
in the finals.

Reggie Graham was entered in
the diving competition, but failed
to place. Steve Ward, scheduled
to compete in the freestyle relay
couldn't do so because of illness,

Obermiller looks forward to a
good season in the new P. a.
complex next year, in spite of
the loss of four senior lettermen.
Leaving are Co-captain Williams,
freestyler McBlain, and divers

THE LABOWITZ REPORT:

Basketball:

A weak Grinnell basketball
team ﬁnished with a season
record of 844 with a 7711 con-
ference record. Nonetheless this
represents the team’s best
performance since 1963-64, when
Grinncll came in withaB-B record
in loop play,

John Pfltsch lays much of the
team’s trouble to “Weak shooting
and a lack of speed. . ,” While
these were partially comr
pensated by hard defense work
and effective rebounding, the
team lacked experience and was
prone occasionally to fold up and
die in the middle of games.

The loss of Terry Holloway due
to a knee injury was detrimental

to team performance. Holloway
lcd last year's cagers in scoring
and rebounding, and many obs
servers felt that even the ex
Cellent performance of Bob
Burnett could not compensate for
this loss.

Burnett led in scoring and
rebounding this year, averaging
17 6 points a game, and sparked
some of the team's best perr
formances. This ranked him
third in conference scoring and
earned him a place on the Allr
Conferencesecond team.

Burnett and Scott Hanson, the
secondrhighest scorer (10.3 points
per game), will return for next
year’s play, as will Bombinski
and Beckman. This should be at
least a solid foundation for future

,teams and for a possibility of

reversing Grinnell's usually
dismal basketball performances.

Lessons to Survive By . . .

By John Nigel Pepper

Meditation is a pleasant, if,

sometimes useful occupation.
Folks like George Herbert,
Marcus Aurelius, and the
estimable Mr. Descartes would
sometimes start meditating and
become Immortal before they
properly knew what was hapr
pening. The technique reached
the apogee of the acme of its
Zenith in Saint Ignatius of
Loyola’s Spiritual Calislhcnics
(this, of course, was before the
invention of isometrics).

The technique is essentially to
concentrate all of one's attention
on a single object of com
preliension, and to unpack its
metaphorical implications,
consequences, prerequisites, and
so forth. The object could be a
thing; a navel, for instance, one‘s
own or someone else’s. Or it could
be a sentence, e.g. “Neither a
borrower nor a plumber be,” or
”Pomegranates will be
prosecuted to the fullest extent
of the Law." I found myself
struck with one such recently:

There is a scene in W. C. Fields’
film, ”My Little Chickadee” in
which Fields, having been shown
the door by Mae West, retires
to the sheriff's office of the small
western town in which the film
is supposed to take place. As he
sits down to eat there, a Hayseed
enters. Fields entices the
guileless Rube into a Game of
Cards.

“Is this a game of Chance?,”
inquired the nick,

“Not the way I play it.” Fields
replies,

1,0 Jokes and humor are not the
same thing.

from “Humor."

too.

1.2 Imagination is the essential
element of Humor.

1.21 Cause and eftect preclude
imagination.

1.3 Chance excludes cause and
effect.

1.31 The actuality of causality is
not in question. Chance militates
against cause qua caus'c. A
chance occurence is an unlocked

2.0 Providence depends

2.1 Providential acts are so called
because of their consequences
and are so conceived because of
their cause, '

3,0 The world of sports is a world
of cause and effect. (address of
Mr. Eddie Robinson to the Dallas
Young Businessmen's Asso-
ciation, 5&8, Feb.6,197ﬂ).

3.1 A good record in Grinnell
Sports is construed as conclusive
proof that God Exists.

4,0 Grinnell sports are about as
humorous as Newton’s Second
Law of Motion slipping on a
banana peel.

4.1 The above (see 4.0) is not
humorous.

4.11 It may be funny.
