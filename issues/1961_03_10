Last night the Grinnell Plays . 1.1mm»
er's production of Thornton wild-
er's "The Skin of Our Teeth"
went on the boards or ARH
theatre The play, a diiticult
one, was received by an enthw
siastic audience and provided an
emoyable evening oi "theatre”
in spite ot obvious shortcomings.

First. the play itself leaves
something to be desired. it is
otten "gimmicky,” sometimes re
dundant, and moves in such a
random manner as to render it-;
self, at best somewhat contusing,
at worst directionless and ob-;
secure, All this is to say that

the play is held together by at
very thin line. Much oi the pi‘o-' ,*

ductlon's weakness sprang from
the seeming inability of the show
to find this “line" and hold it.

In addition to this, ‘Skin’
demands a certain flare of
Showmanship, a quality often
associated with musical corn-
edy, to get off the ground

The acting was tor the most

A Hankie To Shipley

A handkerchief to Ml Shiplev so he can nipe the
mail from his eyes. Conti 1y to some populai opinlo: s
we think Shipley has done a satisfactory Joli. In spite of.
accusations of hanl1’_ panky, dealing under the table and
from the bottom of the deck. Shipley's last two concerts
have proved to be pleasant entertainment.

job. a thankless and most difficult one, has its
pi'lililem The student bodv is seldom pleased before a'
concert. To the social co—oldinatcl' falls the job of being
leader, educator and new—idea man, rather than the re-
flector (if all campus opinion (whatever that may be). We
have often wondered how Shipley has managed to retain
a mildrmannerecl (sometimes perhaps too mild-mannered)
countenance when faced by the good ole hummin’ an‘
strummin’ an’ singing" Josh White crew who have never
seen Anna Russell or the Gomez dancers, and “darn we”
aren’t going to!” Shipley is to be commended for rising
above the good-ole»let’s notetryea11ythiiig-henxcauseit’s—iiot~
sale tradition.

One thing which Shipley has done we would like to see
more (if. The correlation between concert enterdinment.
and other events on campus as in the Gomez t1'oupe»LAC-
e\pe1iment (and how they all screamed aliunt that one)
we thinkvl was most succe'sflll and deserve further consid-

in. This sort of thino’ might be looked into before
the spring fine-arts fe‘ i\al.

A second area in which Shipley was less succe 111 is
coiioeined with that much- Allietlv‘dlmlllrlnlt-neVel'rn'luCh-'
done -about suwgestion of securing cheaper, not so well-
11111111111 enteltainment. What ever happened to a second
Cene Bluestein concert?

The difficulty here, of course. 5 that we can’t have
our cake and eat ll.«t00. Right now there is only so much'
money; it's either a lot of small concerts or one big one.
Furthermore, this sort of approach requires of the social
eo-urdinator a wealth of experience and a good deal more
digging: than has previously been done.

One w v out could be the recently suggested laise in
the acti\lt1ts fee. We would favol 'uch an increase were
it kept well uithin leasun and new it used l'lil some 1eall
solid enteitainnient such as tli t Shipley ha‘ bloulg'ht. We
would not favor an incr which \\1iul1i lie used for more'
lounge parties. Union parties, women's gym parties, mens
locker room parties, boiler room parties et al.

much luck and suggest that perhaps he should lingin

Both Miss Dennington and
Miss Gissenaas gave quite
similar answers to the questions
put to them by the present

They both agreed that the‘

Miss Gissenaas suggested that
perhaps the AwS Board couldl
work with the CofHP to allevis

Miss Dennington. She suggested
that perhaps ot .r methods

Talbot View: Doctrine} Effects

By Judith Talbnt
When President Monroe sent

his annual message to Congress‘

in Dec, includcd
lilmuus Tolerance to
America: ~The occasion
been judged proper for
ing as a principle in which the
rights and interests at the US
are involved that the American
continents are hencei ~th
not to be considered as subjects
for iuture colonization by any
European power . . . we should
consider any attempt on their
part to extend their system to
any portion or this hemisphere
as dangerous to our peace and
satety . . . "

Thc Monroe Doctrine was a
statement prompted by concern
ior the security at the US, not
by concern for the fate oi the
newly independent Latin Ameri—
can countries; the statement
was directed at European, not
,at Latin American ears. The
US would be much saier with
small independent nations as
neighbors than with large
European colonies. Following
the proclamation oi the Doc.
trine, the relative "peace and
sa.y in the western hemis-
phere was actually guaranteed
by British control of the seas.

in the 19th century, two im-
portant and lasting attitudes
toward the Monroe Doctrine
evolved in the us. The iirst,
influenced by the moral over—
tones oi the doctrine: the big
brother attitude; the second,
given impetus by the policy
of hegemony and the senti—
ments oi Maniiest Destiny: the
interpretation oi the doctrine
so that it seemed to imply the
right or US intervention
Corollary aiter corollary
(Pulk, Hayes, etc.) demon»
striated the latter inﬂuence.
In Latin America there were

also two general attitudes ios—

tered by us actions and the

Monroe Doctrine. There was a

certain tear of European inter-

vention. which gave rise to an
appreciative altitude, an accept-
ance oi the original statement
of the Doctrine. The other atti—
tude, far stronger, was resent—
ment toward the Colossus oi the

North. Resentment deepened as

each corollary departed iarthcr.

iroin the original statement.

1823, he a

has

A good example or the con—
tradictory attitudes on both sides
is found in the study oi the
Venezuelan request for arbitra-
tion by the SU in the British
Venezuelan controversy over the
Venezuelan-Guiana border in
1875, Venezuela appealed to the
US to help her in a dispute
with Britain, but she was cer-
tainly also distrustiul or how
Pres. Cleveland might l-eintel‘r
pret the Monroe Doctrinc. Cleve-
land‘s use or the Doctrine in
the case, even though the
British logically proved that due
ing so was stretching the point
way oii base, led directly to
Teddy Roosevelt's corollaries
and the era ol Dollar Diplo—
macy.

Roosevelt's corollaries added
to the Doctrine the right oi the
US to exercise police power in
Latin America to make sure
that debts were paid, govern:
. ments were eiircicnt, that there

no “chronic wrongdoing"
which might “ uirc interven—
tion by some c ilized nation
'and that in_the western hemis—
phere the adhcren e at the Us to
the Monroe Doctrins may iorce
the US , , . to the exei oi

an international police force."

This new announcement was
made for Latin American cars;
such an extension oi President
Monroe’s phrases has since been
proved, notably by the Clark
Rcicreirdum. to bc cntirciy nne
justiiicible. it is signilrcant to
note that even in this lilo<l rme
per-rallstic corollary we rind the
traditional moral overtones
charactcristie of US attitudes
and policy; the phrase “chronic
wrongdoings" . .

Our neighbors to the south
were understandably outraged

by sucha policy and the ln- .

Lalin‘

asserts '

an economic rival

ierence that they were “un-
civilized” did not salve any
‘ wounds. There were numerous
interventions, military and
,- lrnonetary, during the Rouse-
vclt and Tait years.

President Wilson introduced a
new method of intervention by
reiusing to recognize the Huerta
lregime in Mexico. This policy
or de jurc recognition had the
‘unlol'lunate rcsult, in several
linstances, 01 causing the failure
‘of revolutionary governments
‘(unstable) and in Effect pulling
dictators back in power (order-
ly). This sort of intervention
has been typed “intervention by
apathy". A par-ado. is the {act
that Wilson is highly regarded
in most or Latin America.

l Coolidge, Hoover, and their.
,‘Secretartss oi State laid the]
lioundations ior the Good Neigh—
lbor Policy. Many historians be-K
’lleve that Coulidge's appoint
rncnt ot Dwight Morrow as amr
hassador to Mexico was the iirst
big step. However, his Secretary‘
oi State, Hughes, made it clear
lat the Havana Conference in
'1928 that the Monroe Doctrine!
was a unilateral policy. Thel
effort to make it a multr ateral
doctrine had been a major policyl
oi all the Latin American gov-
el‘nmenls.

 

l

Largely as a result oi his I
prcinaugural trip through
Latin America (the first by
a [is President), Hoover took
an active interest in Latin
America and made his Latin
American policy a iar more
conscious one. He withdrew the
Marines irom Nicaragua; the
Clark Memorandum condemn-
ing the Roosevelt corollaries
was published as us policy.

 

' The ciiect or the depression
on USrLatln American relations
was enormous. The economic in.
terdependence oi the two areas
became obvious to all; realiza—
tion oi the need for economic
cooperation played a great part
in the realization that political
cooperation was a must. Finally,
at the Montevideo Conierence in
1933, the Monroe Doctrine was
proclaimed a multilateral policy.
The OAS was born, In 1934 the
Flatt Amendment to the Cuban
constitution was nbroagated; the
US renounced the right to m-
tervene in Central America and
the troops came home irorn
Haiti in 1939 we ended the
Panamanian protectorate.

The rise of Fascism. a threat
common to all, proved a Valli»
able counter-movement to Penn
Amcricanism; it served as a
basic impetus for cooperation in
hemisplicric defense. During the
war our relations with Ai‘gene

tina were very strained. Argen»

democratic leaders an embrace t

It is easy to see why Dr. Cass
tro has such an easy time arous-‘
ing the ire of his fellow Cubans‘
by reieiring to the history of
US»ciiban relations, particularlyl
the Flatt Amendment. The point,
must be made clear that in suchi
cases the imperialism ot the US
was almost entirely economic,
not political, Although there
were several chances, and ab;
ways pressure to do so. the US:
did not annex Cuba, The case:
as many similar ones, has proved
.that this type ot tie is far sti'ongg
er than political ties.

The common Latin American

icture oi the US as the coir»
sciously imperialistic Colossus

or the North is as ialse as tho i

common Us picture of Latin

America as a barely civilized
jungle.

The history oi' the diplomatic
relations between the US and
the Latin American countries Vis‘
much more a story or neglect
than of conscious imperialism
en the part of the US. a story
of coping with diplomatic prob—
lems caused by short-range pol—
icies dictated by immediate self-
interest, a story of mutual ig-
norance and misunderstanding o:
the social, cconornic, and political
conditions which have giveni' e‘
to the historical. political pr :-
snrcs in the US and in Latin
America.

with the revolution in all oi
its aspects: the background. the
present and the future Come
rnunisin and Cuba, agrarian re—
ioin-i, toi ign domination and
presi‘cvolution miscry are taken
up. But because ot its (actual,
relative calm approach, “Anais
oniy" is by far the better of
the two as a study aid for the
Latin American Conicrenco,

Both books show an optimism
toward the progress or the
Cuban revolution. Mills and
Hubei‘man and SW y hold
great hopes tor the admittedly
uncertain future In spite of
this, "Anatomy” implies a rathe-
er disheartening likelihood. If
socialization and naiionallzationl
continue in Latin America, there:
is, according to “Anatomy,”
little hope that ilic United States
will take Cuba as a "lesson” in
bad policy and go on to lead
the rest of Latin America to
political democracy and eco-
nomic independence. ‘

“Big business interests
which are already sutiering
losses as a result of the
Cuban revolution and stand
to lose so much more irom its
spread to Latin America . . .
will not scrapie to use any
and all methods to attain its
ends." '

l
i

In other words. it. as both}
books insist, United States policy:
is strongly influenced or evenl
determined by the interests or
big business it seems that the‘
ideals and principles of demons}
racy have taken a back scat‘
to the probabilities of proiit, This‘
is a slanted opinion but that'
men such as Mills, Sweezy and

Huberinan believe it is reason
enough to give these views full‘
consideration. 1

Saed met me at the bottom
ot the hill to take me to her

time struggling to communicate
iii Turkish, liaiian. Spanish. and

She had 19' ned ltaliaii in a

, Hall an hour later Stied's
aunt and cousin Behan arrived.
Behan is a student at the col-

Their curiosity led to such div

I was not being paid, I think
tliev thought 1 was avoiding the
issue,

They were as direct about
giving direct compliments as
asking personal questions. I
ﬁgured out later, though,
that the reason they thought
I looked like an American

not that i looked like a model.

‘ As I was walking through the

main square in town today I
saw some boys playing soccer
with an orange, 1 mentally note
ed it as something 1 hadn’t. seen
beiore, The thought came to
me again that living in a for-
eign country and trying to cone
vey my lite to people at home
makes me more sensitive to the
dittercnces and unusual things
because they are entertaining.
Yet; taken collectively the una
usual experiences and aspects
a not representative of my lite
here, Much ol my time is spent
doing the. same things i would

lbe doing in the States. This is

particularly true because 1 am
teaching a school sponsored by
Americans.

I also realize, though, that I
have become used to lstanhul
enough to take many things toi-
granted that seemed ditterei-it at
first the donkey cart do

sible to believe that we were
walking down the street together
in Turkey and yet it was so
natural They only stayed two
