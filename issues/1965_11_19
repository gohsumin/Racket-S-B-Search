Congress Salvaged Great Society,
Carl Albert Informs Grinneliians

By DICK CHADY

“The day in which the Great So-
ciety was saved” was the first day
of the first session of the 89th Con-
gress, according to House Major-
ity Leader Carl Alberto

Albert delivered the 1965-66 po-
litical lecture Wednesday night and
took as his theme “Legislative
Leadership in the Great Society."
He discussed the role of Congress
sional leadership in organizing and
initiating Great Society programs.

Speaking to a crowd of only 300
in Roberts theater. Albert said that
willie President Johnson is “the
most skillful legislative tactician
of this generation” the key vic-
tory was “conceived, sponsored,
and directed" by House leadership.

Albert was referring to the
changes in House rules cheered on
the tirst day of the 89th Congress,
By adopting a “21-day rule” the
House was able to bring to the
ﬂoor certain hills which would
have otherwise been blocked by
the Rules committee.

And by changing the composi-
tion of the Ways and Means com—
mittee, the House leadership was
able to “control the character and

Wot Included in Decision-making'
Says 56.4 of Ila/I Reorganization

A student government-circulated
petition to President Glenn Leggett
was termed “thoughtiul” and
"gracious" by the college presie
dent.

The petition sought more student
voice in possible decisions about
reorganization oi the residence
halls and gathered 830 signatures.

“We don’t think we're being in-
eluded in the decision~making
about hall reorganization." was
the way Jerry Goddard, Student
Government president, opened
comments to the residence halls
Tuesday night. Goddard went
[mm hall to hall speaking to all
Al dorms. ,

. Goddard indicated that thq,£x-
Ocutivu Council ‘of the iaculty’had
recently been discussing the ‘pos-
tibility of reorganizing the hall
Iystem. He iurther saild that as
things stand now the Executive
Council would make recommem
Actions to President Leggett who
would make the final decision.

. Leggett said that the Executive
Council oi the iaculty was discuss-
trig the problem but that the com-
mitteo was “Very informal" and
that “we're a long way from a
decislon.”

The student petition complained
that the student “rule is going to
be one of objects oi consultation”
and that “students should have a
substantive participating rule be-
yond occasional consultation in

 

any decision on the organizing oi
the residence halls.”

Goddard then suggested that a
joint student - faculty e adminis
tration committee be formed to
discuss the problem or to discuss
it indeed there is a problem at alli

The petition went on to suggest
the joint committee, and rurther
stated that “this proposal involves
no preconceptions about what
changes, ii any, should be made
in the hall systemr The students
themselves are not agreed on this

problem We only ask that the
different opinions be allowed to
actively participate in the decision
process"

in his reply yesterday Leggett
said that he has “asked the EXeCLI~
tive Council oi the {acuity to in-
volve itself in the discussions, with
the hope that it will be able in a
iew weeks' time to construct a
statement at loose proposals which

composition of every committee in
the House"

“Without these changes, it is
doubtiul if any Great Society bills
would have been reported to the
ﬂoor of the House." Albert stated
emphatically.

He explained that even though
the membership of the House
changed considerably atter the
1964 elections, the membership on
the Rules and the Ways and Means
Committees would have been iden-
tical with prevrons years — ii the
changes hadn’t been made.

Albert noted that the Congress
passed 73 major bills, or 88 per
cent of the President's Great So:
ciety program, and that “these
relorms in Januarywere the most
important thing we did all year,"

Albert devoted the second part
of his speech to the misconcep-
tion that “Congress is incapable of
initiating or producing major
bills."

He pointed out that the legislative
process in a democratic country is
necessarily a slow one, often spans
hing as much as 25 years between
the need and the action oi legiy
lation.

But “legislation is not the ex-
elusive province of elected lead-
ers" and “the public orten Con<
(uses White House identification
with the actual initiation of a
bill."

He cited the Area Redevelop-
ment Act, the mass-transit bill,
the immigration act, Medicare, and
the tax reduction bill as examples
oi legislation originally conceived
and prepared by the Congress, and
later identified with the White
House.

Albert concluded by describing
the 89th Congress as ”the session
which has settled more persistent
issues than any other Congress"

Congress Initiates Most Legislation, ,
Asserls Albert of Press Conference

By PAM CLAY

Carl Albert, House Majority
Leader since 1962, willingly an-
swered questions beiore a small
crowd at the student press con-
ierence Wednesday. The out-spo—
ken partisan said that "we are
the aiiirmative party; we are the
party of action!"

He Was asked twice about Con-
gressional versus executive initia-
tiDn of legislation. He stood
strongly tor Congress and said
that in the last session Congress
did initiate most of the legisla-
tion and that Congress is the
only one who can put issues on
the statute books, Congress still
does the legislating; it always has,
and it always will.”

He said that in the next session
a District at Columbia home rule
bill will be passed; but it will
not be exactly what: was asked
for. In addition to the D.C. home
rule bill, be thought Congress
would pass a new minimum
wage bill, repeal ME. look into
the application of civil rights
laws. and perhaps pass an amend-
ment so the selection at jurors
could not be racially biased, He
said that the coming Congress will
be big in civil rights areas and
will go a long way toward easing

 

New Admissions Policy Aims

that in the past the admissions

ally true in the area oi alumni

Terry. “We are striving for effec-
tive use or alumni representatives
in interview situations ior students
at distant points and ior iollowing

activity, however. requires sub—
stantial organization."

Terry also mentioned that he is
interested in seeking alumni in
teaching positions in the public
schools who can help identify out-
standing high school scholars to
be contacted by the admissions
staii.

The interview itseli has a new
twist. Rather than have I stu-
dent raltle on about his board

ties, the unsuspecting scholar will
be expected to carry on a discus-
sion or a more intellectual nature

that politics in the South will get

that it was “a Republican who

said that he believes in a two

As for the child in the messy

is pretty materialistic. May 1 sug-

1 am setting out, lnolishly, to write that which
has never been rend. For as long a tilne as men have
been able to write, it has been written, yet never

plain that its authority is neither respected nor be-
lieved. As a lover's mistrust is the germ of gro-
tesque jealousies, so is this unbelier the germ or an.
other hind or insanity, an inverse reality so mon-
strous and absurd that the most exquisite gesture
of the mind is not equal to it. Rationality llees trom

therefore confess a bastard hope; that someone will

Charles Rutledge, a Small and wiry man nick-
named “Sneakers," was a soldier. An intantryman,
World War II and Korea. After his name, this was
the first. thing he told me about himself, Loothlessly
shouting as we bounced in the back at a pickup
truck through chilly early-morning mists. i met him
that morning in a pit; he was stooped over a shovel,
excitedly scraping loose dirt trom a ledge, as it high
rank were about to lay a foot there, while above us
on the edge stood the foreman, an exconvict, on in-
credibly base and brutal tyrant. Al tirst I admired
this laborer, who took on the most meaningless
task with the zeal of a high school football player.
Among these rnmhling beasts he seemed to display
one of the more elaborate human attributes: pur-
pose. But he was always the same, and the source
of his ambition bé‘Came obscure. it battled me; he
was drilting in some sort of illusion. This crew had
no cause but to waste time, no common objective
but 5 pm, no sense of camaraderie. He began to
irritate me, linally l despised him. He yielded
readily, and with pride, to the foreman’s most in-
sulting thrusts or authority. But my contempt tunied
to pity, One late afternoon I watched Charles
scramble up a dry bank of earth and knew: he was
not building a highway, he was lighting a war. These

ditches dug for drainage pipe were mockeups of the
trenches.

Charles had a brother, Alfred. Alfred also had
served through two wars. Alfred’s stooping shoulders
carried a great burden of Weariness. His face,
swarthy and grlmacing, was carved deeply with
years of woe. He spoke to me oilen, saying. "Do
you think you’re going to get to like it, Willie!”
with a comic New England cadence. Alfred, too, was
obedient, but not to other men. He was obedient to
the impartial advance or destiny and necessity, He
spent a week in jail, tor something he didn’t do. He
worked quiet and continuously all day. He knew that
time goes by no matter what. He were those in-
tantry pants, heavy with pockets, every day. I
guessed they were as old as the war, (or they were
strewn with patches. One alteration late we stood
together in the rain; we had been driving stakes
inlo the roadbed all day, and he turned to me with
a broken smile: “Do you think you're going to like
it, Willie!” And again I knew: the simple jest that
had preserved the sanity or soldiers {ell dead upon
me.

And so I remembered, a counselor at summer
camp, tall Johnny Nelson. A beautiful Albino, a Billy
Budd and an Odysseus, with a jaw that stood for-
ward with valiant strength. He wouldn't talk about
the war. (He was a marine in Korea; I once over—
heard him tell how he watched ten of his buddies
lose their . i .) Then one evening the camp director
insisted that he tell the campers about his war ex»
pcriences, around a campfire. He talked, about
starving and naked children, until he began to weep,
The little boys giggled. l was alraid the older boys
and men were ashamed. Al sunset the ﬂag waitzed
down the tlagpole to o bugle call. Johnny stood
on the hill and watched, motionless until the flag was
taken off the Chain, folded and was out of sight.
when we were running again he was still standing,
watching. Patriotism? Homage to a torce im«
measurable greater than himself, to an unfathom-
able mystery and evil worthy or devotion.

From these I have learned this about war:
nothing in heaven or earth can make it right.

Smiih: Bible Does Not Answer

That the Bible doesn’t satistac-

its value as a source in a religious
struggle, concluded Dr. John E.
Smith, Chairman of the Depart-

sity, at a lecture in Herrick Chap-
el Sunday night. in the lirst oi the
annual Gates Lectures, Smith
tackled the "Problem of God: Tile
Biblical Approach."

“The Bible is a chronology or

A demonstrative rather than a

passages becomes manifested in
its being rather than in its

1y.

explained. “Amidst these disclc»
sures may be found examples of
doubtfulness concerning the wis-
dom of God, as in this story of Job,
but skepticism never appears."

The Bible was never intended to
dispel! the doubts or a skeptic, he
continued “The questioning, prob-
ing mind introduced doubt; it
was not inherent in the writing
itselfi"

Thus, the task of Biblical writ-
ing is revealing God in an histori-
cal order by means oi concrete
events “The end of the quest is
not inlorrnation, but inspiration,"
Smith said. ”The inspiration orig»

Smith lectures 0n Kierkegaard,
Analyzes Existential Perspective

By IAN BAHL

Defining the existential ap-
proach to the problem of God,
Dr. John Edwin Smith says
the first task of the modern theo—
logian is to force a reexamina-
tion or positivist metaphysics.

Smith, chairman of the philoso-
phy department at Yale Univer~
sity, was the 1965 Gates Lecturer,
and spoke in Herrick Chapel Mon-
day night in the second of three
lectures on “The Problem of GM.”

“We have to plunge in with all
the risk involved.” he said, ”and
force a reexamination of some of
the truncated theories of reality
in which the problem of God nev-
er gets off the ground, and in
which the problem of God is al-
ready settled in a negative way."

Smith dealt specifically with the
Kierkegaardian approach to reale
ity, which begins With a presup-
position oi God's reality and sees
the meaning of existence In the
individual human purpose. This
purpose must be realized “through
knowledge of one's own being."
According to Smith, this is “the
shock oi being there without be-
ing in an the decision.”

Recognizing Kierkegaard's fond-
ness for driving the individual to
an awareness of the universals
present in his own particular case,
and to an awareness that man
may be speaking about himself
when applying universals to other

 

men, Smith said, “Most Individu—
als tend to move In the direction
of the universal vague rather
than to their own particular eye.”
In order to progress to a subjec»
tive state in which the individual
eye focuses on the universals,
people must be driven to (arm
their answers by drawing them
from their own questions.

Thus, according to Smith, be-
coming existential means recog—
nizing ”man's nature as a respon-
sible moral being who must act
and choose, and who can’t avoid
the responsibility or this free
dom.”

Smith cited Kierkegaard‘s dia-
lectic of life styles—a way of con-
ducting oneself on the basis of one
major principle There are three
basic life styl the esthetic, the
immediate satisiaction oi the pres.
ent; the ethical. a call of duty or
personal commandment; and the
religious, based on raith and trust,

“God appears on the scene as
a solution to the problems or the
first two life styles,” Smith Said.
The purely esthetic or ethical life
is inadequate, he believes, be-
cause “an attempt to live a life
of satisfaction of the present mo—
ment impels treatment at other
beings as objects, until the man
himself becomes an object who
can't please himself at all, and
an ethical call of duty is too
enormous a responsibility for man

 

to bear." Man Is propelled into
a religious lite style because oi
his awareness that he can’t live
the others

Smith saw the reality of God In
Kierkegaard’s approach as “not the
same as the problem of exis-
tence Dr non-existence of a ﬁnite
object. The reality of God is bound
up with the extent to which the
individual recognizes a change
within himself and his deliverance
from the esthetic and ethical life
styles.” If existence is to be re
served tor sense objects, and God
is not a sensible object, then
"God does not ‘exist’; he Is eter-
nal." Smith addedﬂ‘GeiHs real,
and exists in the individual, insu-
far as God furnishes a ground for
his subjective being."

The difficulties of Kierkegaard’s
View come because “confining the
problem to man’s existence runs
the risk of losing its relationship
to the rest of the world and the
Community of individuals," stated
Smith. Also, he said, “It is an ac-
cepted view that when I think
about something, it must be made
into an objectt There is nothlng
inherent in thinking itself that
makes what is being thought about
an object. We need to have not
only the truth of participation, but
also the truth of distance. Man

must get out of the throes of the
problem and think about I! in or-
der to see the point."

The greatest difficulty that
Smith found in Kierkegaard's view
was his acceptance of the doctrine
that existence “means only what
it means for sense objects; God.
emotions, human relations do not
‘exrst'.” This View of nature of
reality “excludes God at the out-
set, not just at the end. God has
to be dead if he does not exist,
and does not exist at the outset.”

Smith asked, "What is the jus»
tificatiim for the View that God
does not exist, but is real?"

“You Can’t begin with an intel~
lectual commitment [D reality by
excluding God at the outset and
expecting to bring him back
through irony at the end," he con-
tinued. Thereiore, this theory must
be questioned in open up a whole
new discussion to get into new
metaphysical problems,

Objectivity. Subjectivity Merge

During Lecture

Ky PAUL G. KUNTZ

John E. Smith delivered the
Gates Lectures on “The Problem
of God." The problem is the real-
ity of God. That. is, considering all
that is, what ground is there for
the whole system? All religion, ac-
cording to Smith, hangs on the an-
swer.

The earlier approaches led up to
the "Metaphysical Approach” in
the third lecture, SmiLh advised
his audience that his method was
dialectical as a Socratic search for
definition, moving from the inade-
quate to the adequate.

Biblical revelation discloses God
in and with events told in histori-
cal order. God never appears ex-
cept in circumstances in which
men act. Hence a peculiarity oi
Biblical theology: it retells the
mighty acts ascribed to God, but
does not argue. Herein is the weak-

on Metaphysics

ness or such a theology- it must
interpret, yet it professes to be
wholly objective.

Smith moved on from the posi»
tion of pure objectivity m the po-
sition of pure subjectivity — that
is, to Existentialism. The classical
existentialist, Soeren Kierkegaard,
wrote to shock us into awareness
of our unique privacy. The religious
existentialisi has a relation be-
tween two subjects, the human self
and the divine self. In this rela»
tionship, there is no world, in the
sense of nature or of society. The
Kierkegaardian drops the world
out of his scheme. in its way, this
is as inadequate as the Biblical
approach in its way.

In a subtle manner, the third ap-
proach, the metaphysical, pulled
the objective and the subjective
aspects of reality together. But the
third lecture was not a synthesis
of two earlier stages. Smith’s ar-

gument rests on taking the sen as
the model of reality. Only in the
self do we know the one and the
many together. Then by analogy
we move from the sell that has a
body to God that has the world.
This is no proof, said Smith, for a
proper hypothesis can be only
tested by absence Lil a condition
But God as ground of being is such
that it must be always present.
What is there that leads men to
recognize the presence of an une
limited knower? The Search for
knowledge in human experience
such as the history of science is a
search for an infinite goal. The
scientific quest can never attain
perfect tmtli, it can only approxi-
mate to a complete body of correct
answers. Hence human experience

of a world presupposes God, for
men mean by God an ultimate
consciousness, related to all, which
310118 is what Could be called the
consciousness ot pcriect truth.
Smith, when charged with hav~
ing assumed God from the begiiie
ning, accepted this analysis as
correct, But then he responded.
why he like Sartre, whn excludes
God from the beginning? Sartre
can't be Sartre if God is real. The
test between a [hEISllC and an lithe»
istic position is the adequacy to
all that we know. If you want to
try humanistic existentialism, go
ahead, said Smith, try to work it
out without me dogmatism such
as in a Biblical approach or the
confusions and inadequacies of the
Kierkegaardian approach.

The tie was soon broken after

gave the Pioneers a 146 lead.

while its pass defense was a little
less stingy. Carleton was only able
to gain 24 yards in 38 carries on
the ground but were able to pass
for 240 yards in 31 attempts.
These figures are slightly decopa
