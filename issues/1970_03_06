Bauhaus and Brechi‘ Fea’rure
Finish ofWeimar Symposium

A lecture about Walter Gropiu »
the architect, a presentation 0
selections iroin the writings oi
Bertholt Brecht, and a series of
films completed the Symposium
on Weimar Culture.

Protessor Marcel Franciscono
of the University of Illinois spoke
about “Walter Gropius and the
Founding of the Bauhaus,” The
Bauhaus was an expressionist
guild founded after World War
I with the intention of making
visual art an instrument of social
regeneration. Gropius did not
incorporate any radical changes
into his buildings, ior he thought
that art was above utilitarian
constructions oi any kind, He
Viewed art as a sort of “back-
wardrlooking, craftroriented
expressionism." Gropius created
very little in concrete terms, but
his vision has affected all lorms
of art expression ever since.

Selections of the different kinds
of things that Bertholt Brecht
wrote during his career were
presented' in the arena theate. oy'
Robert lngham and a group’ of
actors, This included selections
from Brecht‘s poems and from
two oi his plays, one the
Caucasian Chalk Circle, the other
the balcony scene irom a lustful
and socially instructive re-
working of Shakespeare‘s Romeo
and Juliet which Brecht never
completed.

After the periormance, Mr.
lngham lectured brieﬂy about
Brecht’s career. The writings of
Karl Marx, which he became
acquainted with early, appear to
have inﬂuenced his dramatic
works. Brecht took as his ﬁrst
principle oitheater that it should

instruct the audience about social
change. He thereiorc

itself. it it even iniurious to the soul."

Staff Voies To Lower Requirements

At the meeting of the faculty
last Monday afternoon, it was
voted to recommend to the board
of trustees of the college that the

requirements for the positions of.

Policies Committee, division
chairman, and chairman of the
faculty be lowered, The chair
manship requirements were
voted as three separate motions
in the above order, and passed
with ever-narrowing margins,
the last, iaculty chairman, by a
vote of only 38 to 31.

It the trustees accept the
taculty recommendation,
assistant pi-oiessors will be
eligible for divusional chairman-
ships and chairmanship or the
Educational Policies Committee
and associate professors with

chairmanship.

Yugoslav Government Revokes
Passport on Rosenfield Lecturer.

By The Editors

Milovan Djilas, Yugoslav
author and philosopher and
iormer Communist Party chiei
under Tito, was scheduled to
present this year's Roseni‘leld
Lectures on Sunday, March a
through Wednesday, March 11.
On Tuesday of this week the
Yugoslavian government seized
his passport and he is unable to

leave the country.

lllC Yugoslav government [or his

criticism of their refusal to
condemn the Soviet invasion of
Hungary in 1956 In 1962 he was
once again arrested' for
publishing a book based on his
association with Stalin.

Djilas has written numerous
books. including poetry, novels,
and short Stories. In 1968, after
his last prison sentence had been
commuted, he spent a year as
a guest lecturer at Princeton
University.

campus and dispense items such
as birth control pills. He also
strongly favors the establishment
of a ”Crisis center” for drug
users, “If that center helped five
students a year, it would be
Worthwhile.”

Loewi asserts that the faculty
student ratio is Grinnell’s main
strength. As {or academic im
provements, he is hopeful that
the committees on graduation re-
quirements, grading, and the
freshman year will have some
strong proposals. or student-
initiated academic changes, he
said: “The administration and
faculty are going to be impressed
with a proposal that’s well-
researched, weilrdeveloped. 1
think the lacts are in out favor.
Our education here is definitely
Out-dated. I think Phil Mears was
right to mention that there are
more students on academic
probation now than ever before."

Loewi had the iollowing to say
about the student body in
general: ”l think they are
strongly interested in getting
something concrete done beiore
they get out of school. They
showed this in the mass meetings
on the position paper. It is now
up to the leaders to get the
students activated. "

As for his immediate plans,
Loewi stated: “Right now I’m
looking for qualified people to iiil
the positions of student coordinar
tor, student auditor, and social
coordinator. l'm going to iind out
who would be good ior the Senate
and the house president positions
and urge them to run.”

The students appear to have
reacted quite positively to
Loewi’s program of specific
positive action. Mears. the other
“activist" candidate. received
the second highest number of
votes. “Jim Panzee", whose
campaign was predicated on the
idea that student government is
and always will be a iarce,
met with extreme diffidence at
the polls, failing to garner even
to per cent of the vote.

Cafe de] F oro

For the past three weeks, Grinnell students have
been blessed with an opportunity for relaxing weekends
such as has long been lacking. Jon Stein’s coffee house
in the Forum, appropriately named Cafe del Fore,
has provided us with a Weinstube contrast to the
Bierstube atmosphere of the Forum Grill. It is quite
a pleasurable diversion from study to be able to sit
quietly, sipping cider or tea, and enjoy folk music
or other entertainment drawn from the plenitude of
talent available among the students of Grinnelli

Jon has worked a long time to make this coffee house
possible He was one of many students who were
disturbed that no use was being made of the excellent
facilities available'between the Grill and the South
Lounge and aware of the need for a quiet alternative
to the Grill. He did something about it. He has garnered
the best performers from among the students to provide
entertainment, and they are of such quality as to have
surprised many of the students who were unawa
that such talent existed at Grinnell. He has gone to
Des Moines and Chicago to provide fresh pastry, talked
students into baking cakes and made tea, cider, coffee
and espresso available, Yes, Shirley, you can even
buy lox and bagels with cream cheese at the Cafe del
Foro.

Attendance has been somewhat erratic. It is to be
expected that the cultural events of a Grinnell weekend
will draw a certain number of students who might
otherwise spend much of the evening at the coffee
house. But they have managed to pack the place several
times. Jon has promised us that he will try to opEn
the coffee house during the week and for longer hours
on the weekends if response continues to be good. We
hope it will.

If you didn’t know about the coffee house, or if you
just haven’t been there yet for some reason, try to
stop by this weekend. You might be surprised.

 

We have gotten several comments, some favorable,
some unfavorable, on our policy in the letters to the
editors column. Some people feel that we should devote
less space to letters and more to news, campus or
otherwise. We agree with those who are glad we are
providing a forum for members of the Grinnell College
community. We feel that in many cases the availability
of this forum is even more important than the limited
amount of news which a college paper this size can
provide. Oh those occasions when we do not publish
a letter you wrote, you can be sure that it was because
01 space limitations, and not because you disagreed
with us. This should be apparent from the letters in
today’s column. We edit this newspaper because we
feel strongly about campus issues. If you feel strongly
about campus issues, we want to give you a chance
to make your feelings known.

Letters to the Editor . . .

To the Editor:

Having just returned lroni a
trip to the East Coast, 1 was
distressed to read Bruce N issen's
letter in the Feb. 20 $528. I find
it astounding that Bruce
disclaims ever having said ”. .
we're working for a society that's‘
above tree'speech." So Bruce
calls me a liar for saying that
he did make the statement, and
I say Bruce is a liar for saying
that he didn’t, ‘

I also find it rather amazing
that Bruce should claim that I
”admitted that it wasn’t a
genuine quote.“ I never said any
such thing, least of all to Bruce
who has never even talked to me
about the matter. He would be
better oil not using secondhand
information from his girlfriend
Sally Hamann when engaging in
such personal attacks.

But all of this isn't really
getting to the heart of the issue.
Bruce might have much better
written a letter about just what
are his political views vissarvis
the free press. I find it most in»
tcrcsting that the Bruce Nissen
who claims he is a supporter of
Cuba's present policy oi lack of
freedom of the press is also the
Bruce Nisscn that writes the Ann

To The Editors:

In the traditionISM of the
greatEST negatiVISTS of our
generationISM, n. R. GrossIS’l‘,
Strom ThurmIST, and Shirley
Temple BlackIST, we encourage
the Grinnell student body to
support the 5&8. In last week’s
stirs the editors promised us that
their endorsement would be the
“kiss 0[ death” to any candidate.
We believed the editors because
everything they have condemned
this year has succeeded. For
example, last week the editors
recommended that the students
boycott the election. We can see
no other reason for the stu-
pendous turnout. This can lead
to only one conclusion. It the
editors really believed that their
support would constitute a kiss
of dcath then it would only seem
rutioiiaLthat they should have en-
dorsed all the candidates. Fora
tunalely. they acted irrationally
To paraphrase last week's
editorial' we do not intend to
impugn the characters oi the
editors. Nor do we believe that
this negativisin is necessarily
reprehensible, but we do believe
that irrational negativism cx-
crclcs something which isn’t the
product oi a maliunctioning
pituitary gland.

To The Editors:

We believe it necessary to
correct the ‘tacts’ and, perhaps
more importantly, the con-
jectures of last week‘s sou
editorial. It is unfortunate that
this seems to beawcekly chore.

First, although your financial
statistics are roughly accurate
(after all, you got them from us),
the context in which you place
them is highly misleading. You
ncglccted to mention the close to
200 copies we distributc ircc each
week, you ignored the [act that,

pending legal negotiations, we
had yet to claim the $50 allocated
by the Senate; and perhaps you
didn’t know that we give a
commission of 10 cents per copy
to all stores and non-staff
salesmen who distribute High
and Mighty.

Secondly, High and Mighty is
not a profit»making enterprise.
High and Mighty goes into debt
each issue and manages to repay
the debt only by selling copies
across the state, no simple task.
individual staff members pay the
bulk of each printing bill out of
their own pockets. So far, all of
these loans paid back by.
our offrcampus sales.

The iinancial goal or High and
Mighty is to raise enough capital
to pay each printing bill without
borrowing irom individuals. The
economists call this capital in-
vestment, not profit. In addition
we are trying to raise enough
money to subscribe to Liberation
News Service (the UPIVAP of
undergrounds), Underground
Press Service (an exchange
network with other papers), and
other syndicated items, hoping to
provide a better newspaper for
our readers.

In explaining your editorial,
You told us that all ol the above
may be true, but “if you stopped
publishing after any issue, you
would have a profit left over.”
on the contrary, all funds go
right back into production of the
paper and if any money is left
at the end of the year, we would
try to put out a free issue.

We would like to add a further
concerning the finances oi the
student Senate. Although it may
be true tllat, as the student
auditor stated, the Senate is flat
broke, the special Senate budget
is only one small part at the total

President's Report:

The Structure 01‘ Student Power Committees Play

Toward the end of last term,
in response to the desire of
students to consider how they
might play a more effective role
in the decisionrmaking process of

students who had been appointed
by the Student Senate, and form
an Ad Hot: Committee to
deliberate what Considerations
and procedures it thought might
be most effective.

Counseling, established by the
recommendation of the com,
mittee of Student Affairs, was
charged with the responsibility
of evaluating the student and
resident advisory program and
working with the Dean of
Students. This committee and its
particular function will continue.
A parallel group, consisting of
members of the original come
mittee, plus two additional
students designated by the

Studentb/ Student Senate and Dean WalL

as a resource person _is now being
set up by the Ad Hoc Committee
The mandate of the enlarged
groups is to review the existing
decisionemaking processes, to
evaluate established procedures,
formulate recom-
mendations That is to say, the
function of the enlarged Comr
mittee on Counseling, within its
area, is procedurally similar to
that ol' the Committee on Social
Rules and Regulations and the
Committee on Counseling will
make its recommendations via
the Dean of the College to
“Committee A,” which will then
proceed to forward its recomr
mendations to me and the
trustees as will the Committee
on Social Rules and Regulations
and the Committee on Student
Services,

While these committees set

about doing their work, the
processes of the College must
continue, Existing decision:
making mechanisms must
go on, For instance,
the College must begin
almost immediately to interview

faculty groups, as well as staff
persons, are already involved
and will continue to be. Ideally,
I would prefer to wait for such
interviewing until the three
committees had made their
recommendations and the
trustees had responded, but the
rapidly approaching end of this
year, the need of the committees
to deliberate without undue
haste. and the supply of available
candidates are matters which
have to be considered
realistically and promptly.

Other student Senate comr
mittees which are more con-
cerned with short-range planning
will make their recom-
mendations through regularly
established Channels, It is my
understanding that the Student
Housing Committee and the
Student Handbook Committee
are now meeting with the Deans
of Students and making
recommendations which affect
planning [or this semester.

The Drug Committee,
established by the Student Senate
during the fall semester lose to
plan the drug symposium, has
been enlarged to include three
faculty members, two resident
advisers, and seven students Its
responsibility is to make
recommendations for an on-going
educational program (including
perhaps a “crisis clinic") ap~
propriatc to Grinnell College.
Specific recommendations for
the formulation of any programs

will be sent to the Committee on‘

Student Affairs. This Committee
will study the proposals and its
comments and recomr
mendations, and submit both
reports to me.

i believe you can all see that
the period between now and the
middle of May will be extremely
busy for all who are serving on
the Committees, for the in-
terviewing teams, and for all
those involved in the general
process of giving constructive
thought to how the decision

can be made more represen-

New York Brass Quintet

By Kathryn Heinze
The New York Brass Quintet,
performing under the auspices of
the Grinnell College Concert
Series, presented a concert last
Saturday evening February 28 in
l-ierrick Chapel. The quintet,
considered to be one of the best
in the country, played to an en-
thusiastic full house and even
merited a standing ovation from
a small number of Grinnell
students. The program which
included works from every
century since the sixteenth
presented an interesting sam-
pling of brass music from all
musical periods. Special em-
phasis was put on the twentieth
century, and for those (ﬁinr
nellians who have developed an
allergy to contemporary
music. the intermission provided
an excellent opportunity for exit.
To this writer’s way of thinking,
it is unfortunate that so many
people chose to turn chicken and
run away at the threat of hearing
something more modern than J.
5. Each; they missed several
very interesting and challenging
works and forfeited the op-
portunity to see an impressive
array of brass mutes which
ranged from a plumber’s friend
to a tuba mute that was so large
it reminded one of a footstool.‘
The concert opened with an
anonymous sonata from “Die

The Nature Of A Liberal Education: Part 3 Bmhﬁan Romeo‘ Didacﬁc
The Principles of Definition Are Discussed Lover. Poliﬁcizes Viewers

By Professor ll. G. Apostle

In framing a definition, one
may proceed (a) inductively or
(b) analytically; and each of
these methods has its advantages
and disadvantages. For example,
in drafting a constitution for a
nation inductively, one may
study the past and existing
constitutions, compare them and
contrast them, and then choose
what appears to be the best of
all, or else choose the best
elements in them and form What
might appear to be the best
synthesis of those elements.
History tends to teach us in-
ductively what is probable, but
otten it does not reveal all the
alternatives. Analysis, on the
other hand, tends to exhaust the
alternatives or possibilities, but
withouthistory and experience it
may not point to what is
probable. Older men tend to Cling
to what has been probable;
younger men, especially when
existing institutions fall far short
of die ideal, tend to direct their
imagination to simple alter-
natives and possibilities which on
the surface seem to be the true
solutions to problems. So a
combination of both methods
appears desirable. First, we shall
proceed inductively.

An examination of the
requirements and goals of a
liberal education as given by
Amherst, Carleton, Oberlin,
Williams, and Grinnell Colleges
reveals items which appear to
come under five general
headings:

1. Intellectual competence,
excellence of intellectual
training, breadth of un
derstanding, academic ex~
cellence, search for truth,
development of qualities of mind,
intellectual adventure, etc., all
come under ”development of
intellect."

2. Personal and social
responsi 'lity, moral integrity,
qualities 0! character, social
justice, service to others, etc., all
come under “development oi
eharacler.”

3. A third aim, suggested only
by Grinnell in the phrase ”to
achieve a personally satisfying
and worthwhile life” but required
by all, may be said to come in
some way under “appreciation of
arts."

4. Knowledge of some field in
depth, preparation for a useful
career, etc., may be considered
as coming under “a career."

5, Physical education (though
not explicitly stated, required by
all the above colleges) is for the
sake of health, and we may
consider this under “health.”

is this set of goals arbitrary?
Perhaps there is a prior question:
What is the ultimate purpose of
a liberal education',l If this be
happiness, and if happiness is
what is desired most, then we
still have to inquire what is likely
to make us most happy, Whether
we call this allrinclusive aim
“happiness” or “a most en-
joyable life" or “a worthwhile
life” or “a life with positive
response” makes no difference,
for names do not change the
nature of our desires or of their
fulfillment; so we may as well
use the term “happiness," for
this has been used most
universally.

Next, we may proceed
analytically. rirst, man is a
complex being, and as such he
is capable of many kinds of
pleasures.

Second, he cannot go on
throughout life with only one kind
of pleasure, for he has more than
one kind of need. For example,
he cannot eat all one time, or
drink all the time, or play
baseball all the time, or do
nothing but research work all the
time; the returns [If one kind of
pleasure are diminishing, and the
pressure for another kind of
pleasure by its corresponding
need necessitates a change in
activity, This being are case, the
greater the number oi things he
can take pleasure in, the more
likely he is to make a better
choice and so assure himself of
a continuous life of pleasure.

Third, the variety of needs and
their corresponding pleasures
call for a certain kind of choice
and hence of an ordering among‘
them. One often has to choose
one kind oi pleasure and let
another go; and if he is to get
“the most out of life," he must
think not only of today, but of
tomorrow and the year ahead,
or still better, of the whole span
of his existence, and so he must
reﬂect, make plans, use prin-
ciples of evaluation, and,
ultimately, impose a proper
ordering among the kinds of

pleasuresavailaole,

Fourth, the various kinds of
pleasures are not ready made to
be chosen at will; there are
pleasures, but there are also
pains, and certain pleasures
reinforce or are in harmony with
other pleasures, while certain
other pleasures also cause pains
and bar other desired pleasures.
You may take pleasure in being
rude to people; but you deprive
yourself of other ‘social
pleasures, such as that of
iriendship, and you cannot expect
people to be ready to help you
when you need them. A hare
monious set or pleasures
resulting in no pain may be
likened to a scientific system in
which all the propositions are
true. The analogy may be stated
in the form oi a proportion,
namely, pleasure:pain::truth:
talsity. ln the scientific system,
the principles are axioms, and
what follows from these are the
theorems; and if the axioms are
true, the theorems will
be true also, and the
whole system will be free
from contradiction. Similarly in
a man, his principles are his
habits, and what follows from
these are his actions which
correspond to those habits; and
if those habits are right or

In keeping with the Brechtian
tradition of instructive theater,
the Drama Department’s par
ticipation in the Weimar Symr
posium was both informative and
entertaining. The various short
readings were overshadowed by
the three complete scenes from
Romeo and Juliet and The
Caucasian Chalk Circle. The
scenes were not offered as
polished, finished products, but
as demonstrations of Brechtian
theater and as points of depar-
ture for discussion. Even so, they
were very well received by full
houses ior two nights.

The two versions of Romeo and
Juliet showed how Brecht in-
troduced an element of comic but
severe didacticism into the
usually straight, romantic in-
terpretation of the balcony scene.
This is a typical example of how
Brecht used drama, not to invoke
pity and tears, not to display

melodramatic overacting, but to
stir an audience to indignation
Over the fact that conditions
analogous to those presented on
stage exist in real life.

The scene from The Caucasian
Chalk Circle demonstrated
Brecht‘s theory of theater as a
selective description or dramatic
retelling of an accident, without
any pretension at convincing the
audience of the reality of the
illusion on the stage, either by
naturalistic dialogue, setting, or
lighting,

The discussion following the
scenes further Clarified Brecht’s
theories about drama, and
gave additional historical
background about the man, his
plays and his time. I would en-
courage more programs similar
to this, not only for their benefit
to the actors, but alsoito all who
would like to sample one par-
ticular author, his plays, and die,

”Sonatine" by Eugene Eozzia,
was perhaps the most technically
demanding of the periormance.
The faster movements were
lively and rhytlunic and were
contrasted by the largo and

position as in the others, I found
little to criticize. In brief, the
level ot performance was very
high and ‘nothing but the most
laudable terms could be used to
describe the New York Brass

The Senate Meets The Administration To
Discuss Grinnell's Financial Problems

By Tom Greenﬁeld

moth disruption or the natural

In the absence of Jim Lew,
Andy Loewi took over the chores
of ring master [or the Senate
meeting, This devastating politi»
cal shift touched oil the following
highly unnatural chains of events.

1) The Senate cut back on its _

spending. 2) Tom Thomas did not
ask the Senate to do anything.
He wasn't even there. 3) There
was no castigatiuns oi the SM}
or Mr. Bierman. 4) Art Knowles
was dragged into the Senate
meeting to [ill the one needed
chair tor a quorum, thereby
making him personally responsi-
bleior starting a Senate meeting.
5) The Senate, for the most part,
undertook important business.

Dean Walker asked to speak
to the Senate’s “collective
mind.” He was informed that this
was impossible because Steve
Schwartz is no longer in school.
However, he made do with what
he had.

Sounding not unlike Doug
Klein, Dr. Walker announced that
the College is hurting for money.
As a result the College is con-
sidering the lollowing proposals,
tor reducing student services
next year: the elimination oi
linen service (a savings at some
530,000) and ZLthe elimination
of maid service to the individual
rooms. (Dr. Walker believes that
a program can be instituted
whereby the students could have
a choice of using a commercial
service or providing their own
linen and doing their. own
cleaning.)

Sally Hamanrl raised the
question about the late at the
maids if the elimination of maid
service to rooms were to occur.
Further discussion raised the
following questions: Will the
maids be eliminated'.I Will they
be forced into janitorial work?
Will they be phased out? Will the

college community know the
administration's thinking on
these issues before the budget is
drawn up and approved?

Dr, Walker was not sure about
these questions as Mr. l-Iawn has
been responsible tor working out
all of these details Dr. Walker,
however, said that he would
straighten out all 01 these mat-
ters by volunteering to talk to
Mr, IIawn. The Senate was taken
aback by Mr. Walker's unbridled
masochism, but agreed that this
would hea good idea.

Kathy Heinze launched a den
pressing report on the Health
Center. The College is finding it
quite difficult to attract staff to
our fair town. Even substantial
linancial otters may not be suia
licient to entice the number of
people necessary. Dr. Walker
assured the Senate that the ad
ministration will keep working
with the problem. The College
urges students to try to stay very
healthy until the problem is
resolved.

Students concluded the
discussion by questioning Drs.
Wall and Walker on the general
state of the College’s finances.
in keeping with the College's
desire to compare itself with big
name eastern schools, Dr, Wall
proudly announced that Grinnell
is now deficit spending 7 just
like Wesleyan. When asked for
a comparison of diis year’s
budget and last year’s,‘ Dr.
Walker said that we were able
to come up with a surplus last
year by working on a ten month
fiscal year. This clips a iull two
months off the old ACM record.

Charlie Doherty openly
claimed that he caught some
iaculty members making "prer
meditaled prevarications” and
“frantic jestutes“ last Friday.
The Senate thought at first that
Charlie had busted another
iaculty party, They were relieved
to discover that he was objecting
to the tact that students were

of judging which is better and

know what is _meant by

almost straight. Similarly, to say

vague, capricious, varying from

into those which are pursued lor
their own sake and are ends in
themselves and into those which
are pursued for the sake of
something else and are means
or instruments to an end.
Evidently, the ends (assuming
they are good) are better than
the means to them. Riding to the
stadium and buying a ticket are
means to an end, which is watch-
ing the game. Similarly, we
buy groceries in 'order‘to enjoy
a good meal; we do not enjoy
eating in order to buy more
groceries. Other activities which
are ends in themselves are these:
listening to music, seeing a
movie, reading a novel, being at
a party, playing a game, in-
venting machines, doing
research, and sex. So students
go to college to get an education.
But why? In order to better
themselves, which implies: in
order to lead an enjoyable lile,
a happy life. This does notmean
that the pursuit of the means is
painful. lt olten is, though it need
not be, and whether it is painful
or not often depends on the
person’s attitude. Still, the end
is usually more pleasurable than
the means. What about health,
is it a means to an end? Health
is in men, and its absence
diminishes or obstructs the
pleasures ol die mind and or the
senses. Anyway, health is a good
thing, and the leeling of health
incrﬁses all the othJ pleasures;
and we need not be too academic
about its nature here. We might

also add this, that many ends
cannot be realized without the
means; so to disregard the

means towards those ends are
barred is to make also the at-

place you can‘t stand. Your prospective students
need your full attention and only if you're happy can
you give them what they need. it's your career, be
selfish enough to make it a good one.

There's no question about it—studenfs in elemeno

tor both kinds of pleasures and
usually is itself pursued as an
end in itself; for example, a
student chooses teaching or law}
or medicine as a career because
he considers it as an enjoyable
activity, and at the same time
he expects to earn a salary,
which is a means to an end. The
arts are required because the
appreciation of them is ens
joyable. Finally, physical
education is required {or the sake
of good health, and good health
contributes to the enjoyment of
life. In short, the inductive and
the analytic methods differ in the
manner of stating their goals:
The inductive tends to state the
goal more in terms of means;
the analytic does it in terms of
ends and is Somewhat more in-
clusive. And for those who
proceed inductively, this is
usually the case; for experienced
men who make no study of
analysis are good pragmatists
and have a general feeling of

what a liberal education should,

do, even though they do not spell
it out adequately.

We may summarize the results
so far as follows. An inductive
examination of the goals of a

liberal education suggests
development of intellect, a
career, appreciation of the arts,
development of character, and
health. An analytical approach

‘means happiness as the ultimate

goal and indicates as the means
to it the development of the mind
and of the character in a healthv
body. The phrase “development
of the mind“ here includes that
intellect, a career, and the apo
preciation of the arts. Both the
inductive and the analytic
method take as an axiom the fact
that the kind oi education we be,
defined here is the best of all
kinds of learning relative to the
happiness of a man; A sketchy
and provisional deiinition may
now be given.

A liberally educated person is
one who has acquired (a) a
developed mind (in the sense
indicated above) through learn
ing, (b) a good character
through the exercise or the
proper habits, and (c) the habits
necessary to maintain and
promote a healthy body, all of
these for the sake of a Continuous
life or happiness.

The elaboration of this sketchy
definition is our next concern.

The 1M Basketball struggle
saw a series of titantic clashes
of epic proportions, and when the
debris cleared, Read retained
sole possession of first place in
the overall standing This haps
penstance was due to a couple
of Read victories over the
Norrises, and also because
Cowles took two from Haines to
knock them from a tie for first.
Outside shooting by Bill Dicks
and Grant Little (3 timthonored
formula for IM victory) proved
overwhelming to Haines. The
Read machine rolled on -— what
can you say about a 12935 Victory
over West A team? This one saw
Read score 46 points before West
Read starters hit ior 20 points
or more, with Ed Hirsch (acV
curate. and yet humble) hitting
for 27, The West team showed
a lot of class by not givtng up

SCARLET AND BLACK

Returni

By Roger Rowe

The Grinnell Pioneers fought
back last Weekend after a
disastrous road triprto claim two
victories in basketball from their
Wisconsin rivals, Lawrence and
Ripon, In both games the margin
of victory was provided by clutch
performances in the second half.

Trailing by a single point to
Lawrence at the intermission
Friday night, the Pioneers
spurted ahead at the outset of
the second half to take the contest
73-64. It was about the same story
Saturday, as the cagers were
deadlocked 31-31 until they pulled
away in a bitterly fought contest
to take their first win over Ripon
in six years, 64-56.

Early in the second half with
the team trailing and with
scoring leader Bob Burnett
sidelined with four fouls, Greg
Beckman, a junior forward took
control of the game to swing it

accountaoly and permanently
lost to us. Our only meagre hint
as to his identity is that he
himself seemed to have been uns
certain of his identity, and that
he made it his subsequent life’s
work to discover it, Unfor-
tunately, The Man Without
Enemies never did find out just
who he might be, cwtng to the
fact that everyone he met was
too kindly disposed towards him
to let him know.

Friends, we live in a wonderful
Universe, chock-full to the beams

g Netmen Win,
Picking lip Two in Darby

in Grinnell's favor. Beckman
scored 22 points and hauled in
19 all-important rebounds to lead
the team in both departments.
Most importantly, to of these
points and 13 rebounds came in
the closing stanza. Burnett
finished With 18 points, Hanson
with 12, and Johnson with 10 to
round out Grinnell’s Well-
balanced doublerfigure scoring.

On Saturday, it was again
Beckman who provided the initial
impetus in the second half
againsta physically stronger and
more aggressive Ripon squad.
Pouring in eight straight points,
he helped the Pioneers pull away
from the 31731 lie to a 39735 lead.
Unhindered on Saturday by
personal iouls, Burnett claimed
a major part of the action with
19 points, most oi them in the
'second half.

Scott Hanson led the team with
10 hard-fought rebounds, but to

no avail: Ripon outgrabbed us
47-38 in this department. Beck-
man finished up with 18 points
and 9 rebounds, with Hanson
putting in 18 points and Burnett
3.

However, the most significant
difference between the teams
was in accuracy. Grinnell sank
50 per cent of its floor shots, while
the Redmen could only net 28 per
cent in the second half, The
stronger Bad Guys continually
got more than one shot on each
visit to the goal, but singly they
were unable to get their range.

On the strength oi their
weekend sweep the Pioneers
upped their record to 7-9 in the
conference and 8-12 overall. This
assures them of their best record
since 1964, when they went as
and 12-10.

Only two games remain in their
schedule as the Pioneers travel
to Cornell this Tuesday and then
to Knox a week later.

Tankmen Sink Cornell
Capture“ Billy The Duck"

By Reggie Graham

Last Friday’s meet against

defending conference champion
Cornell provided an excellent
iinish to a perfect season (the
first for Grinnell in eleven
years). About fifty Grinnellians
made the trip to Mt. Vernon to
watch us beat Cornell G7 to 37
and Win “Dilly the Duck” for the
best dual meet record.

/ ﬂ - e ~’
Reggie Graham

Our very own 0b Squad
provided entertainment between
events and managed to alienate
the Cornell team and fans with
its unusual repertoire of cheers.
The whole team thanks everyone
that come; we are glad we were
able to make the trip a rewarding
one,

Our medley relay (Ron
Brammer, Bruce McKean, Jim
Williams, and Bruce Rollins)
began the meet with its usual fine
performance, swimming a 3:565

for a pool record, just short of
our school record. Mike Daley
swam a good 200 freestyle
(1:54.41) and later broke his
school record and set a pool
record in the 5006.23.41).

Steve Ward swam a fantastic
2:116 individual medley for a
school record, Ken Glass of
Cornell (last year’s champ) won
the diving with a pool record oi
235 points.

Bruce Rollins won the fifty and
100 yard freestyle events, tying
the school record in the latter
(50.1). At 50,3, just touched out
by Bruce, was Steve Ward, with
his best time of the year,

I-Ial Dale won his year's best
in the butterfly, and Jim
Williams did an excellent ioh to
win the backstroke (he missed
every one of his seven turns, but
he won anyway, which was the
important thing)

This week, apprehensive but
confident, we travel to the grand
finale, the conference meet, at
Northfield, Minn. All ten Midwest
Conference schools will be there
vying for the coveted conference
champion title and trophy, Our
biggest competition will be
Carleton (whom We beat here,
Feb. 6). The team is in great
shape and ready for the big meet;
Carleton shouldn’t be much of a
problem. And the rest should be
easy.
