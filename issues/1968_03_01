DES MOINES, March 1 — A
windblown snowstorm swirled
into the state Wednesday, as
highways were painted with a
treacherous coating of ice

The Des Moines Register
reported Thursday that high-
ways in the Central and South-
central sections of Iowa were

“normal to 100
percent i c y
and snow - ca-
vered” — a
statistic cred-
ited to the
Iowa Highway Commission.

Three persons were injured
Wednesday when two cars col-
lided head—on after skidding on
o snow-packed stretch of us.
Highway 30, about three and a
shalt miles west of Jefferson.

Jodi Jensen, 11, or rural Hol-
stein, was listed in critical con-
dition with skull and facial frac—
lures.

Her father, Wendell, :il, sui-
fered a skull fracture of his
ﬁght leg. Cecil i. Oswood was
listed in fair condition with
head and face lacerations.

The U.S. Weather Bureau at
Des Moines told the Register
that weather conditions here for
the weekend are expected to be
similar to prevailing weather
today,

Asked by the 5&3 what the
record highs and lows for this
date were, officials of the Des
Moines paper (The Newspaper
Iowa Depends Upon) said they
ﬁdll‘l know.

High and low pressure cen-
ters met over Grinnell Thurs-
day ailernoon as fair and toul

LEGGETT PONDERS DORM CHANGE DETAILS
FEARS COLLEGE LACKS NEEDED FUNDS

By RUSSELL ELLIO'IT

It the College can come up
with the new finances needed,
we will probably be living in

.integraled campuses (a takeoff

on alternating dorms) under a
student ndvisor system this
tall.

Last September President Leg-
gett expressed the hope that
“when school opens next fall
the physical arrangement for
student living will at least be
started toward the promise of
being radically different"

Ron Cogswell, C of HP Presl-
den't, sees Leggett as being
“generally dissatisfied with the
present living situation."

The Student Affairs Commit-
tee (headed by the Deans of
the College and the Presidents
of SGA. the Coil-IF, and the
AWS Board) has been working
since September on problems in
the living situation at Grinneil
and possible solutions

on February 16, two weeks
ago, the Committee presented
Leggett with an extensive list
of recommendations which he
will bring before the Executive
Council of the Board of Trustees
early in March.

It Is expected that the T1154
tees will take ﬁnal action no
later than June.

PROPOSALS CITED
The recommendations included

"the integration of men’s and
women's Campuses, the initia-
tion of an allocampus room draw-
ing, the expansion at off-cam-
pus living options ior upper-
classmen, the establishment of
a student advising system, and
the continuation of an extended
resident advising system."

an integrated campuses the
Committee proposes that North
campus have women living in
South Younker, Smith, Langan,
Rawsou. Gales, and men in
North Younker, Cowles, Dibble,
Clark, and the Norrises.

South campus will have wo-
men in James, Cleveland, Main,
Mears, and men in Loose, Reno,
and ﬂames

Changes for which the Com-
mittee recommended that new
funds be allocated include en-
closure of the North campus
loggia trom south of Smith to
Gates, kitchenettes to be built
in the new women's balls on
North campus, and additional
lounge and recrroom furniture.

CO-ED LOUNGES

The Committee sees the com-
mon-use lounge between North
Younlier (boys) and South Youn~
ker (girls) as an exciting tiist
step towards “coeducational
halls at Grinnell."

The student advisor is to be
a paid worker who is responsi.
ble to his resident adviser and
who “should seek to work close<

ly with the da ~today function-
ing of the hal His main re-
sponsibility is to help under-
classmen in adjusting to college
life and its problems

A committee of resident ad-
visors, deans, and student gov-
ernment officials is to select
advisors for next year.

A weekend retreat and I
week of intensive preparation
immediately preceding the fall
semester are seen as opportune
ities for both student and resi-
dent advisors in developing
counseling skills.

These will be supplemented by
weekly sessions throughout the
school year.

STUDENT “ADVISORS”

A program incorporating in
student advisors is envisioned,
meaning there would be one stu-
dent advisor for every 15 stus
dents on campus. Also recom-
mended is the hiring of an ad-
ditional re5ldent advisor and
an intern, or part-time, resident
advisor, which would bring the
total number of R,A.’s to 10.

Another recommendation of
the Committee is “an all-cam-
pus raom drawing using a quota
system for fixing the number
or freshmen, sophomores, jun-
iors, and seniors in a given
hall.”

DETROIT, Feb 24 (LN§) -—
Members of the Wayne Statd
University Student Council rc.
signed Feb. 9 in protest of that
body’s powerless state in uni-
versity affairs,

The students believe that co<
operation between themselves
and the administration is un<
feasible while they are their

power.

The resignations stem from
the Radical Caucus held as a
counter-meeting to the National
Student Assn. conference last
summer. The caucus resolved
to urge campus disaffiliation
with NSA if NSA did not trans-
form itself into a student union
composed of individuals, rather
than elite delegations.

Predictably, NSA did not.

Students here especially want
control over ”student security"
—security files and the campus
police force.

cluding such implicating
data as “political deviations”
and “homosexual tendencies,”

were burned last year, students
here believe are still in exis-

In addition, students are pro-
testing the existence and ac-
tions of the campus cops, or
Department of Public Safety—

didates in Police Administra-
tion, who patrol the campus
fully armed with clubs and pis-
tols.

living the Committee supports
“the offering of more extensive
living options for students who
reside off-campus either in col-
lege-owned facilities or in pri-
vate homes and apartments next
year,”

Student members have indl<
cated, however, that it will be
up to the student seeking pri-
vate-owned housing to find it.

An attitude in which the Cola
lege does not aid students to
find housing in town was cited
as a major stumbling block to
the Committee’s recommddatlon
for “uncrowding” men’s resi<
dencc halls.

SECURITY CHECKERS

A ﬁnal recommendation of the
Commit e's report to Leggett
is the hiring of three “security
check women,“ one for the junc-
ture of men’s and women’s halls
on South campus, one for the
juncture on North, and one for
the Younkers.

With reference to the Com-
mittee’s recommendations, Cogs<
well said that “President Leg-
gett is in broad agreement with
the plan."

The President has serious
doubts, however, as to whether
the College can handle the fi.
nancial hunden that incorporat-
ing the full package of recom-
mendations would entail.

Consequently. he has asked
[Dr and received from the Com-
mittee a set of alternative plans
scaled from $65,000 to $14,000,
which in eltect sets priorities
on each of the items in the
original list of recommendations.

The Student Affairs Committee
has given the proposed student
advisory system highest priority.

HISTORIANS THREATEN EUROPE 1
MOBILIZE PLASTIC ARMIES '

By SUE MILLER
& ADRIENNE LEMMONS
5&1! Staff Writers

Students in Professor Terry
Parssinen's European History
338 class were asked to take
over Western Europe last week.

The class was asked to play
it game called Diplomacy at
least twice. The object of the
game—stated in the instruc-
tions—is to “take over all of
Europe.”

Diplomacy consists of a map
board of Europe and plastic
markers which slgully armies
and navles. The method of win-
ning the game is gaining con—
trol of territories and extend-
ing one’s own borders as far
as possible.

The player whose manifest
destiny is greater than his op-
ponents is the winner, Parssi~
nen explained briefly.

“By rational calculation of
expected benefits and expected
losses,” he said, "the game is
to some extent the way com-
petition with countries actually
works.”

“To play Diplomacy as a
game, one is forced to give
serious arm-chair thought to the
underlying factors influencing
decision-makers in the game
and in real diplomacy," he con-
tinned.

After playing Diplomacy, stu-
dents were required to read
Laforo’s The Long Fuse and to
write a paper comparing the
eisioomaking factors of the
board game and of those elm
cidated in the book about the
origins of World War 1.

The game alone, Parssioen
stressed, is “of course only an
oversimpliﬁed version or real
diplomacy."

In playing the game, a stu-
dent decides “not only the most
rational course to maleize his
best interests, but must cone
vince the other players that it
is in meir best interest to act
in accordance with that course.

In Diplomacy n player can
matte agreements with oppo-
nents prior to actually moving.
An element of reality is added
because there is nothing in the
game requiring agreeing par-
ties to keep their respective
words.

“To make and break alliances
. . . this is where the pro-
longed diplomacy takes place,
not in the moving of the plastic
markers about the map," the
professor further explained.

The game board represents

about fifty geographical areas,
most of which compose seven
countries: England, France, in
lily> Germany, Austria-Hungary,
Turkey, and Russia. Plastic
markers represent armies, and
havies which can capture the
geographical areas.

Each geographical area can
potentially “supply” either one
army or one navy, and to re«
main in the game a player must
retain at least one supply point.

lnilially each country has a
number of armies or navies
depending on whether they are
a sea power or a land power
and on the number of native
supply points within the coun-
Iry.

During the first turn forces
strike out and attempt to cap
ture neutral supply points in
order to increment their forces.

During subsequent turns the
nations form coalitions and a1:
liances in which each side
weighs in balance the eilect of
such cooperative, measures in
the spirit of Von Neumann game
theory.

Parssinen Said he got the
idea to use the game from some
fellow graduate students at
Brandeis University a few years
ago. Althoug1 some of them
now use this method as a teach
ing aid, the idea had not been
practiced at that time.

“The rage was Bogcy moviel
and Diplomacy games," Parss-
inen said of his grad school
days,

He added that the main idea
in having students play the
game was “to teach people to
understand things from the his
side out, not the outside in. , .
Books—l mean this in the best
Collingwoodinn sense of the
word—sometimes do not do this.‘

“Some games make you re-
think the situation in doing, not
in watching,” he avowed. “This
is the best value games can
hav

other Grinnell professor!
have employed games as teach
ing aids. Professor John Wor-
iey used “Wff ’n Proof," a logic
game originated at Yale Uni.
versity, in his Symbolic Logio
classes last year.

Parssinen said he found wo-
men make very poor Diplomacy
players. “They can‘t detach
themselves (from the game)
personally.”

stab in the back in one game,"

STONY BROOK

AFTERMATH OF A BUST

NEW YORK CITY, Feb. 28
(CPS)—Charges at nun~couper—
ation by university administra-
tors and “Gestapo-like police
tactics" were aired here last
week as two New York legisla-
tive committees began investi-
gating the use of drugs on cam-
pus.

The investigations grew out or
a Jan. 17 raid at the State Uni-
versity of New York at Stony
Brook in which 21 students were
arrested on various charges.

The Joint Legislative Commit-
tee on Crime heard Suffolk
County Police Commissioner
.lohn Barry testiiy that school
officials at Stony Brook had not
been informed of the impending
raid because "they had refused
to cooperate with the police in
the past.”

Stony Brook President John
Toll denied the charges of ham
cooperation and explained how
each example cited by police
was “in fact, an attempt to
work with police olficials."

Especially at issue was an in.
cident that took place in March
when the police received an
anonymous tip that a "put par-
ty" was taking place on the
campus.

President Toll testiﬁed that
the incident was an attempt to
frame an associate dean who

found a packet containing marl.
juana placed under his door.

Commissioner Barry claimed
that the administration warned
students at the alleged party
that the raid was to take place.
Retuting Barry‘s testimony
point by point, Toll claimed that
“I know -I can never catch up
with the impression that was
given . . ." by claims against
the university.

The committee came under
criticism for hearing testimony
publicly without ﬁrst determin-
ing its validity in private.

Senator John H. Hughes,
chairman of the committee, ad-
mitted the crime committee had
permitted heresay evidence to
be aired.

The Joint Legislative Commit
tee on Crime was also accused
of “smear" tactics by a lawyer
representing twelve Stony Brook
faculty members, who have ﬁg-
ured in a grand jury inquiry
into drug use by the Stony
Brook faculty, The lawyer ob
tained a court order to prevent
them from being subpoenaed by
the committee.

At another hearing, the Joint
Legislative Committee on Edu-
cation heard criticisms of police
actions used in the Stony Brook
raids.

American Civil Liberties Union

representative Hyman Herman
said that police violated a sec.
tion at the state penal code by
disclosing secret indictments
against students to the press be-
fore those students had been
taken into custody.

He also criticized the police
for allowing the press to accom-
pany them on the raid and to
take pictures of the arrests on
the grounds that most ol the
Students qualified for youthful
offender status.

Assemblyman Joseph Kottler
questioned Commissioner Barry
on the contents or a lM—page
mimeographed plan tor the raid
entitled “Operation Stony
Brook.”

The plan contained personal
information on each of the Sui)-
jects and was made available
to members of the press at a
brieﬁng before the pre-dawn
raid,

Barry explained that the docu-
ment had only been circulated
to police ofﬁcials, but that one
copy had been carried away by
a reporter. An unnamed news-
paper has since published ii
“book review" or the report.

Kottler claimed that Time and
Newsweek magazines had also
been furnished copies of the
documents.

A force of 198 dectectives in
72 police cars participated in
the Jan, 17 raid, They arrived
on campus at 5 am, armed
with pass keys and warrants.

FIRE DEPT SAVES HEDGER HOUSE

KATZ FETCHED FROM HOT HOUSETOP

By a Start Writer

Robert Katz (off-campus sen-
ior) suffered a narrow escape
Monday when men from the
Grinnell Fire Department had
to extricate him from the roof
of his burning residence at
1221 Broad Street.

Katz. who had been talking
on the telephone in his third-
ﬂoot rented room in the house

owned by Reverend John Hed—
ger, heard shouts about 4:30
pm, and tried to walk down-
stairs to investigate.

He was driven back by smoke
and heat [mm a ﬁre that had
already s p re a d through the
Hedger living room and hall to
the foot of the stairs leading
to his room.

After crawling out on the

FIREMEN BEGIN PACKING up their equipment after
quenching a blaze at 1221 Broad Street Monday. The ﬁre at
the residence or Episcopal minister John Hedger began when
one of his children was playing with matches. Senior Robert
Katz, who rooms on the third ﬂoor of the Hedger house, waited
on the ledge of his window until firemen put up the two lad-
ders enabling him to descend to salety,

ledge, Kat: waited until the
firemen arrived and set up
ladders. The Grinnell math ma-
jor then stepped down one
ladder to the root overhanging
the first story of the house and
down a second to the ground.

The blaze apparently started,
witnesses said, when one of the
Hedger youngsters began play-
ing with matches. “A fire
started," Mrs. Hedger told the
5&3, “and Luke (her son, 5
yeais oi age) came and told me
about it.”

Katz, Mrs, Hedger, tour of
her children, and a foster child
were all in the house when the
fire began. One or the children
screamed that there was a fire
in the living room. Mrs. Hedger
ran upstairs and carried her
babies downstairs and led the
other children out through the
back door.

Reverend Hedger is minister
of St. Paul’s Episcopal Church
here and has been involved in
discussion on campus of the
Town vs. Negro student Prob-
lem and the boycott incident
last month.

The fire department put out
the blaze in a few minutes, alter
an engine arrived at the house
and police cordoned on the
block. No one was injured, but
damage to the ﬁrst floor was
extensive.

Furniture in the living room
was destroyed, walls were
charred, and there was damage
from smoke to the rest or the
first ﬂoor.

Fire Chief Fred Taylor gave
no estimate of the damage, but
other firemen in the house com-
pared it to results of a fire in
Grinnell last week which totaled
$5,000.

he mused, “she wouldn’t Speak
to me for days."

The history professor revealed
that he had frequently played
the game tor six or seven hours
and “had never come to the
paint where a person does con-
trol most of Europe."

“It is the opening iive or six
moves that are important (in
the learning process)," Parss-
inen theorized. It is in them
that one “extracts the principle
involved."

“You can‘t read it like a
book," concluded Parssinen, “It
is only valuable when you re-
heat on it with something else,
like a narrative history of real
diplomacy.”

One major failing that Pat'-
ssinen noted among students
in playing the game is a lack or
knowledge of geography.

“At least it teaches them the
dillerence between Apoulia and
Tet-roliaiwhich they have to
know to play the game. It can't
be all bad."

Leggeit De-furreil
In ‘2600 Heist

Two turs valued at more than
$2,600 were taken last Friday
afternoon from President Glenn
Leggeit’s residence at 16130 Park
Street.

A coat and a cape of natural
b r o w n mink—both insured—
were stolen between 3 p.m..
when Mrs. Leggett left the house
tor a iaculty tea, and 4 pm,
when one or the Leggett girls
returned home from school.

Leggett told the 3&3 that
three metal file boxes—contain-
ing birth certificates, passports
and insurance policies—were al-
so taken.

Although the president origin-
ally estimated the value of the
stolen IUI‘S at $2,600. Leggett
told the 5&1; Tuesday night
night that he could not cite the
exact value.

“You see," he said, “they
took the insurance policies that
evaluated the turs." They were
apparently among documents in
the stolen ﬁle boxes.

Grinnell police have not been
able to identify the burglar or
burglars, who apparently en-
tered the house through an un-
locked door.

Police Chief Bill Peters re-
ported that no ﬁngerprints were
found although smudges indi-
cated that the burglar wore
gloves.

Disaster Strikes l in 52

This was a great week for local news here in
Iowa, enabling us to produce a great Iowa news-
paper. Disaster, it seems, strikes en masse one week
every year.

We had the opportunity to cover a robbery
'(LEGGETT DE-DEFURRED, see Page 3); a Grin-
nell professor apprehended for suspected drinking
under age (ALEXANDER PIX, see Page 3); a
quasi-obituary for a former 5&3 copy neditor
.(HECKER ENDIT, see Page 6); a real obituary
(LOCAL IOWAN BURI-
ED, see Page 1); and a
fire — shades of The Vi-
car of Wakefield »— de-
vastating a local minis-
ter’s h o u s e (KATZ
FETCHED FROM HOT
HOUSETOP, a l s 0 on
Page 3).

I o w a weather, of
course, is always a dis-
aster. And apparently it
is always deserving of a
banner headlinerat least
as far as the State’s larg-
est daily, The Des
Moines Register, is con-
cerned.

On the national
scene: Campus cops in
Detroit keep files on all
s t u d e n t s containing
“homosexual tendencies”
and “political de<
Viations;” they also own
a tractor that converts in-
to a riot tank (Page 1).
At the University of
Utah, campus police use
chemical mace as a
“purely defensive” measure (Page 7). We feel like
real live newsmen.

The proposal for alternating dorms (Page 1)
seems a disaster to the editors of the 5&8, but Mr.
MacDowell asked us not to comment on that this
week.

It really was a fine week for black humor.

So you think you've got problems? Things have
been worse, if not just 5 bad. Jonathan Routh’s A
Book of Disaster (available in paperbound for a dol-
lar) goes you one better.

The book contains Vintage-1890 photos and

Friday, March i. I?”

TOM-TOM PANS POWER. RAPS REC

By SUE T. MILLER

(Editor‘s Note: Tom
Thomas, Gates Sopho-
more, won the SGA elec-
tion Tuesday, Feb. 20,
with a til-vote margin.
Out of a total 839 votes
cast (79 per cent or the
electorate), Thomas got
53 per cent; his oppo-
nent, Dan Cheitetz, got
47 per bent of the total
vole. In this interview
held a week after the
election, Thomas gives
some candid comments
on his aims for the com-
ing year.)

Since the question at the role
of student power was frequenb
1y mentioned in the SGA cam-
paign, Thomas was asked how
much he telt student power
would eiiect administration de-
cislons like the new reception
center.

“Well, they (the students)
can go out and steal the cen-
ters lumber as they ship it in,”
he oiiered, or “like at NYU,
they can lie in front of the
bulldozers as the trees are
plowed: but there’s not a
damned thing i can do about
it. The reception center was
fought by three student govern—
ments beiore me.”

“They (the administration)
are the ones that have the
motley — we can express our
opinion, I think they want us
to, but the students have no
power.”

However. Grinnell Students
and their government do have
the power to organize, Thomas
said, and thls organization
should take place “before we
(himself, com? and AWS Pres-
idents, and the Committee oi
Thirteen) ever go home for
spring break.”

Thomas feels student govern-
ment action Should center
around several key problems:
i) all-campus room—draw; 2)
student advisot system; 3) in—
tegrated campuses; 4) no staii
additions; 5) elimination oi
over-crowding on campus.

“I‘ve given the all-campus
roont draw iitst priority,”
qillpped Thomas, “Since no it-
nances are involved.”

As tor his second priority,
Thomas expects the 70 new
student ndViSOi‘s to be “all the
things the ballleboard should
be, and is not.”

“This includes lots of minor
things," he added, "like iust
lettltig people know when they’re
being obnoxious."

Thomas said he was “dis-
appointed lll [he manner the
administration (1 ho S e to inte~
grate the campuses" and that
he would [Ike [0 see the plan
changed.

“Their integration will Stretch
Gt'inliell's building budget lo
the limit. The blocking eni-
ployctl was dictated mainly by
finances,"

The new SGA President sees
his ionrth pi'iutily problem a
the new RA 5 tom —— as a
“ralhel siruclu A! bull sesslon."

“l'll give on example, Last
year my hall (Gales) had a
Blast year, with everyone not
mg each other, everyone pissed
over what each other had been
doing, So we got together one
night and told each other what
was il'rilalini; about us, things
we had never Sultl. Alter two

months of hate, the problem
was solved."

Thomas puts campus over-
crowding last on his list or
priorities because “some would
rather tolerate it and concen-
trate on other changes."

“Unfortunately," he said, “the
overcrowding, especially on
North Campus, is being amel-
iorated by simply changing the
quads to triples. Already, 51
student living quarters on North
Campus have been eliminated.
This is not an adequate solu-
tion to the problem"

Two ither things Thomas
would like to accomplish this
spring are the ﬁrst steps to-
ward a “free university sys-
tem,” and "considerable ex-
pansion oi the Student Used
Book Store."

”The taculty here has a great
amount of talent that isn’t be
ing used now,” he added.

“It would he a nonrpressure
system—informal meetings in
residence hall lounges, or avail-
able ARl-i classrooms.”

Asked about the status of the
present petition for credit (or
extracurricular activities, Thtk
mas said that it’s still Deﬁne
the faculty. The problem. he
said, is ”how to determine full
participation, For example, how
many times does one have to
sing in the choir to be a choir
member?"

Thomas concluded by reat-
iil'ming his belief in the “indivi-
dual approach” to government.

“We want to get SGA out of
the vacuum, unto the cam-
pusr” Asked to define Ihe vacu-

um, he gave his answer in
the form or a question: “how
often has Ric MacDowell been
in your hall?”

“1 hope l‘m not disappointed,"
he added, “with the people who
turn out to run for the Comv
mlttee of Thirteen. Practically
any student on campus has a
chance of getting elected. i hope
they don't leave it to the
politicos."

“The broader the base (01
student participation), the more
originality of proposals there
will be injected in student gov-
eminent.”

(the 5&3’5 lawn News Service)

A poster publicizing a Feb-
ruary 25th recital in Roberls
was removed last week from
the Forum bulletin board by
Mrs. Jewell Hawk, Forum Direc‘
tor, prior to the Sunday per-

In designing the poster Fred<

Henri Rousseau which depicts
a reclining nude serenaded by
a native playing a horn in an
African tainiorest setting.

The original was donated by

to the Metropolitan Museum at

hangs as a permanent acquisi-

Based on grades ior iirst semester, 175 students made the Dean’s List. To qualify tor
a place on the list, according to Dean oi the College James H. Stauss, a Grinnellian must
take enough credit hours (twelve hours) to qualify him as a tull-time student.

Those maintaining grade-point averages oi 3.5 or better or those who rank in the top
ten percent gradewise tor the semester (which ever group has a larger number) have let-

The 5&3 received a number oi inqui es lrom students who received incompletes in
courses, thereby preventing them tronr making the Dean’s List. Dean Stauss assured the
son that alter grades are substituted for the incompletes, students who would make the
list based on their grade-point average wouid then be sent letters or recognition.

THE RIGHT

BY
Wm. F. BUCKLEY, Jr.

Twice in a single month, gentlemen oi the Right have applied
pressure on me to modity my views — not so much on things in
general, but on things particular, namely themselves.

Pressure is the gentler word for blackmail. most specifically
threatened by Mr. Robert welch, the head of the John Birch So-
ciety, who grieves because neither 1 nor any thoughtful conserva-
tive have found it possible to share his delusions. I wrote recently
about the John Birch Society, to comment on an analysis of it!
gradual disintegration as described in the Wall Street Journal,
and now Mr. Welch has replied in tones most threatening.

“ . In all seriousness,” he writes in the current Bulletin of
the John Birch Society. “we now make to Mr. Buckley the legen-
dary otter by an oldtime honest politician to one of his opponents:
‘You refrain from telling falsehoods about me, and I’ll continue
to retrain trom telling the truth about you! which,” says Mr.
Welch leeringly, “under the circumstances disclosed by our bulg-
ing tiles, about Buckley and some or lils associates, is a very gens
erous otter, indeed."

Mr. H. L. Hunt of Dallas is most easily identified as the rich-
est man in the world. I had never before wrltten about him, but
wheir a month ago the Saturday Evening Post asked me whether
I ielt 1 could write an essay in deiense of the rich, I accepted the
challenge, even athwart the massive presence of MI. Hunt, a man
7 as I put it — of “eccenlrlc understanding of public affairs, 0‘
yahoo bigotry, and of appallingly bad manners.“

Embarking on a one~lnan campaign to prove my point, Mr.
Hunt began by writing are a garbled and rather pathetic letter,
closing with the suggestion (hat I “make some amends,” and sing
gesting that I might “Say something favorable about something I
have done or am doing if you can find anything.”

whereupon Mr. Hunt began to barrage newspaper editors with
exposures oi my own political infidelity, the suspicious company
I keep, and a defense of his own pllblic.career, most of Whlch, at
the moment, is Vested in a radio program called Life Line.

The unguarded Mr. l'luut informs the editors that "Lile Line is
not dominated by my rlglibwlng politics nor by any ioundalion I
own. Llle Line actl‘lltles are conducted by Life Line Foundation,
its president, Board of Directors, Board of Advisors, writers,
speakers and other gifted Freedom technicians."

Having established the total independence of Life Line, Mr.
iluut writes that “it could serve a good purpose it it becomes
known precisely where (Buckley) stands,” and appends a copy
oi the Internal Security Subcommittee’s Guide to Subversive 0r-
ganizations and Publications, earmarked to show “Frank s. Meys
er.” an Editor or National Review > ”From 1938-1941 director of
the Chicago Workers School, which was under the direction of the
Communist Party” and “Will Herberg” -— Associate of National
Review, “former Managing Editor cl Revolutionary Age, official
organ ol the Communist Party.”

Mr. Hunt does not mention that the Senate Internal Security
Suhcolnmlttec has published testimony and essays by Mr. Frank
Meyer. Or that l alluded to the work oi Dr. Herberg as among the
classics or an:i»Commulusm . . . probably because he doesn’t
know.

Nor does he know the riot-st oi it, which now, under the press
sure oi exposure by him and Mr. Welch, l publicly confess, for the
first time.

I an! a Russizn agent. My real name is Buhkliski, and during
the months of July and August 1946 — nobody has ever asked me
where l was during July and August 1946, which shorts what is
happe . g to our internal security — the real william Buckley
J12, touring in Eulee, was abducted; and I, who had been trains
ing at an espionage Denier in a Moscow Suburb, began my long
impersonal: r l‘iiy payniaster at Yale University was me Catho-
lic chaplain.

What happened to the real bucklcy — he was an awfully nice
fellow 7 I don’t know, though the tumor ill the Party is that he is
back in [he States, rising the pseudonym David Flye. My order-s
wore in penetrate the right wing and immobilize and otherwise

to be — “you're doing line Olily hatch out tor H. L. Hunt and
Robert \i/clchky. They're the only ones we haven't been able to

How right he was.

SALT LAKE ClTY, Utah
(CPA) — MACE, a Chemical
irritant that operates like learn

security oiiicers at the Univer-
sity of Utah.

Campus officials said that use
of the chemical Was intended to
be “purely defensive.” One of
the university’s vice presidents

noted that the MACE is not
generally used to control
crowds, and that an oiﬁcer must
“hit the individual in the face
in order for the Mace to be used
eiiectively.”

The Utah campus police car-
ry only MACE. Security ofﬁcers
at Colorado State University,
however, carry both MACE and
revolvers. The spray has been
used six (lines since the CSU
police began carrying it about
two years ago.

BIG TEN INVESTIGATES
BONUS BABY SCANDAL

ANN ARBOR, Mich” Feb. 28
[(CPs) — Charges that Universi-
ty of Michigan athletes have
been given discounts, and even

gifts, by Ann Arbor business-
men are being investigated by
the Big Ten here.

John D. Dewey, assistant com<
missioner of the Big Ten, has
been questioning athletes,
coaches, and businessmen in-
volved to find out if Big Ten or
National Collegiate Athletic As-
sociation rules have been vio-
iated.

Dewey’s investigation began
after the Michigan Daily re-
ported in a copyrighted story
that Ann Arbor clothing stores,
a restaurant, and a movie thea-
tre had given athletes discounts.

Two days later it was report-
ed that Michigan State Uni-
.versity athletes were getting
similar benefits.

Dewey said he will go to
M.S.U. to investigate the situa-
tion there after finishing his
probe in Ann Arbor.

At Michigan State, the Daily
reported that —- in addition to
Discounts -— athletes there were
allowed to charge long-dis-
lance phone calls to the number
oi one of the football coaches
and were given "grill passes"
[or use at campus snack bars.

It also reported that Duffy
Daughterty head football coach
ut M.s.u., had paid for a trip
to the school for parents of n

football-playing prospective stu-
dent.

Under Big Ten rules it is il~
legal for member schools to pay
for such trips.

After reading the Dally story
Daughterty said he might sue
for libel, Since then, however,
he has not indicated whether or
not he intends to go ahead with
the suit.

Doughterty and other coaches
at the two schools could be sub-
ject to discipline by the Big
Ten if the investigation shows
the discounts and other benefits
were used to help recruiting.

Several athletes said they were
informed of the discounts dur-
ing recruitment.

CAGERS CONOUER
AFTER 1] LOSSES

Grinnell won its first basket-
ball game in nearly six weeks
by defeating Lawrence 91-86
last Friday, The victory broke
a string of eleven straight losses
for the G-rnen, who had not
won since beating Carleton 65a
64 last January 12.

The Pioneers made 54 per
cent of their shots from the
field and broke 90 points for
the first time this year. The
team also grabbed 41 rebounds
while giving up only 33.

Saturday, however, the Pin-
neers fell to Ripon 9083. Terry
Holloway had 23 points and Mike
Schwartz 22 to pace the team.

I' Today’s lesson is, “How I found Happiness by belng Obnoxious
during 1. M. Basketball" or “What to do when the other team is
Wretched.”

Take, for example, the case of Langsu and South playing the
Bates “B” team. One cannot fully understand the illustration un-
less they have been fortunate enough to see Gates play, but an
inalOgous situation would be to correlate Gates to the March of
Dimes poster girl; any other team to Bob Hayes and then stage
n footrace. Gates takes the apparently outmoded view that I. M.‘s
I; for fun and, therefore, the “n" learn is out to have a good
1 2.

Enter the Villain (Stage Left). "If we put on a fullconrt press,
we could probably score lot) points and that would prove that we
Ire really good.“ 50 South scores 103 and Langan scores 10] and
a good time is had by all, right? Please pardon my reticence but
I'm apparently not up-to-date with the new I. M. philosophy.

Give me a chance, though, I‘ve got a ping-pong match sched-
uled with a double amputee.

Smith took a commanding lead in the basketball standings by
Mating Dibble twice. The next night Dibble beat West in both
games to regain second place. Smith has lost one game; Dibble
three; West four.

There are only two unbeaten teams left in the league, East
"A" and smith “B”. with the quality of competition at a seem.
Ingly higher level this year, these records are quite enviable.

l. M. ping-pong will be held this Sunday with Doug Gilbertson
If East back to defend his singles title. In other miscellaneous
news, the top five teams in the college bowling league are within
two points of each other.

WRESTLING WRAP-UP

Friday. March I. Im

G-MEN MMTEB F03 LAW OF DENH

By JEFF SCHECKTER
5&1; Pioneer Analyst

It is ﬁnally time to take a
look at the Grinnell Wrestling
team, now that only the Midwest
Conference Championships are
left in the season.

The Wrestlers feel, apparently,
that it is infeasible for a Pio-
neer team to win more than
two contests in any season. Like
the football team and the basket-
ball team, the wrestling team
has won only two meets and
now has a 2-12 dual meet rec-
ord. As Coach Pfitsch recently
said, “Iowa’s ‘ Fe b ru ary
weather is frigid and Grinnell
College‘s sports have not been
much better.”

Most of the wrestling team‘s
problems stem not from poor
wrestling but from a lack of
depth. with only eight regular
varsity wrestlers, the squad is
forced to give up between fif-
teen and twenty points a
match.

Looking back to the beginning
of the semester, the grapplers
lost to Knox 2642 on January
26. The Pioneers won four of
the six matches wrestled but
gave up 20 points in forfeits.
Winners for Grinnell were Mike
Martinson (123), Joel Richman
(130), Bob Jenkins (145) and
Bill Wedding (167).

On February 5, the team took
on Cornell, the best team in
the conference, and lost 32-9.
Martinson won EH), Jenkins 673
and Wedding 6~Z for the Grin-
nell points. The Pioneers also
lost on the following Saturday
to the same Cornell team in
a quad meet. Grinnell was
fourth behind Cornell, Drake
and Coe. Bob Jenkins was the
only winner for Grinnell.

On February 14, Simpson and
Drake arrived to battle the
Pioneers. Grlnnell lost to Drake
2341 but beat Simpson 19-15.
Jenkins, Richman and Wedding
had double wins (or the Grim
nell squad. Other winners for
the Pioneers were Mike Mar-
tlnson with a win and u draw,
and Lou Kelley by forfeit.

Three days later, Grinnell
lost to Western Illinois 298
and Monmouth 21-14. In the
Western lllinois match, Rich-
rnan won $3, Wedding won by
forfeit and three Pioneer wres-
tlers were pinned. Monmouth
lost bouts to Martinson 3—0,
Jenkins 3-0, Shaw (draw), Wed-
ding 4-3, and Swnrtwood 6‘1.

In the most recent matches.
Grinnell lost conference match-

The Pioneers stand quite a
good chance in the Midwest
Conference Championships. Bob
Jenkins and Bill Wedding am
undefeated in conference coma
petition and should have a very
good chance at taking the gold
medals. Don Kraitslk is defend-

ing champion at 157 pounds and
has a good chance to repeat
with a little luck. Joel Richman
and Mike Martinson are our
other hopefuls, but the 115 and
123 weight classes are very
tough this year.
