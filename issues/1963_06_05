Heading Home

Commencement issue editorials are usually nostalgic
and retrospective, containing reflections on the issues and
events of the year past, and perhaps selecting one predom-
inant problem or issue which still requires attention.

Back issues of the S&B this year show a profusion of
problems, as well as a few memorable steps sideways in
“improving" what is already a highly regarded environ—
ment. Celtninly no single issue deserves attention here,
unless it tied up all our problems into a neat little pack-
age called “the philosophy of the small liberal arts college
in Iowa,"

Because a newspaper must be current as well as few
sighted, however, let us merely say that it‘s lonsesome
around here with most of the students missing, and we in-

'lldliﬁchedule l
