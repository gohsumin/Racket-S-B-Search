. Amid cries of "Iowa llber alles,’

dential candidates have here and there managed to get a
serious word in edgewise.

Now we‘ve'heard them, and we’re still not very excit-
ed. The big,y problem as we see it, is, neither are they. In
none of tlle candidates have we been able to see the en-
thusiasm and true leadership qualities which charactei'ed
out—going; president, Duane Ki'ohnke; the fire just isn’t
tllere.

it’s no easy job, when the candidates appear to be
equally innocuous to choose 'the least innocuous. Our
attempts are only feeble ones at best. However, this is
the race aiid its problems as we see them. The most im-
portant questions seem to concern the 'NSA closely asso—
ci~ ted with the whole matter of national affairs discussed
here last week, and the new constitution problems, that is,
how to translate all those many new directions into action.
Both call for strong leadership. Tnere are among the
three platforms some flashes of keen insight into student
government, and at once some of the dllllest, most unorig-
inal “padding” we have heard since the times of “milksop
Student Councilism.”

as we see it, student government must be mole than an
end in itself. The Hendershot approach, though certainly.
we will admit, a more adamant-one than Thomsons oi"
rlzllama‘s, seems a little and pedestrian. His stand
against NSA membership and the limits he attaches to tlle‘

scope of student government seem short-sighted to us, and rupresenlulivc, two-party cystem.’presldcnl grow- lushly in every

affidavit of the National Defense
Education act was passed by the
Council, sent to national govern:

other student governments, and
was inserted in the Congres-

in addition Grinnell led the
Midwest Conference student

pass a similar resolution and to
direct other Conference schools
to consider the issue. Until
Congress eliminates the oath and

should continue its activities a-

The Council formed the Race

that the out-going CofHP and
AWS board define, as part of
their annual report, what each
body considered to be its "house
rules."

The Executive Board, after
careiul review, could then me
quest that the Student Senate
delegate to the new CofHP and
AWS board the responsibility
'for the formulation of these
dormitory rules. As the Student
Senate would maintain its ulti—
mate authority in this or a, it
could rescind this delegation of
responsibility at any time.

In such areas as the hall
orientation program for the
freshmen the fundamentally
diiicrent resident dormitory
systems precludes any com-
mon experience. it is this kind
of legislative issue which
could most expeditiously be
handled by the Coin? and
laws board.

Such a delegation would free
the Student Senate for fuller
consideration of more allvcamv
pus issues On new area now
under its jurisdiction is the mak
ing of social policy. Previously
the Social Caleniar committee
had made recommendation to the
president on such matters as
open dormitori and open
lounges. I feel this is an area
which could be very profitably
explored by the Student Senate.

The implementation of the
new judicial system would logi-
cally begin, 1 would think, with
a thoroiigh survey of the past
adjudicating process.

Such an examination would
entail a definition oi the dor-
mitory rules, how they have
been enforced and the kinds
of punishments exacted. This
would form a solid base of
precedent upon which the high
court and primary court could
act.

There are other areas into
which the Grinnell college Stu—
dent Government Association
could lorge. it could make a
continuing effort to better
“town—gown" relations estab-
lishing a student 52 icc bur»
eau. it could help to attract the
top quality stud nt Grinncll
needs by sponsoring a special
prospective students weekend.

functions of student government

munication between the faculty—
administration and the student
body, 1 have made, in my plat-
torm, four suggestions along this
line

First, the studentviacully i‘elar
tions committee of the Student
Senate should be rejuvenated and
faculty members added. Student
members could communicate tn»
:ulty views to the Senate, and
faculty members would report to
faculty meetings and iniormally

'to their colleagues.

Second. there are faculty com
mittces which wrll not permit,
ior many reasons, student mem-
bership, Where problems warrant
it, l propose student committees,
lparallel to the faculty groups.
’These student committees would
work closely with the faculty
.committees and make recom-
mendations to the student senate.

Third, I would categorical.
ly support another cncilmp»
mcnt with the specific view of
using the reports of the prev
vious gathering to stimulate
constructive proposals by the
encampment committees to the
Senate.

I Finally, 1 would attempt to uti-

lize the halls for informal discus—
sions between faculty and stu—
dents.
