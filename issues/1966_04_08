No Problem on Norlh Campus
Say Two—Thirds of Respondents

An 5&3 survey about the now-under-considera
tion North Campus Problem revealed that about two
out of three students don’t think there is such a
problem.

The survey, distributed last Friday, drew 473
responses and oi those responding, 150 said there
was a North Campus Problem and 292 said there
wasn’t. That represents about 615 per cent re-
spending saying that there is no problem.

Respondents were given nine possible problem
areas and were asked to indicate which of these
they thought were of such magnitude that they
warranted campus-wide attention.

Thirtyrfour per cent indicated that the problem
oi property damage needed attention. That was
the largest area or concern oi the students answer-
ing the survey.

Those filling out the survey were asked their re-
action to three possible solutions put forward by
the Executive Council. Those suggestions to be
rated were freshmen halls, room drawings on
North Campus similar to those on South Campus
and a system of administrationappointed and paid

student rulerenforcers. All three were firmly re~
jected by the students as not being beneficial to
the college community.

The reaction to freshmen halls was 430 - 29
against. The reaction to the room drawings pro-
posal was 324-109 against. The reaction to paid rule
enforcers was 412-53 against.

The other problem areas noted by students were
privacy in balls (25.5 per cent), noise levels in halls
(27 per cent), mobility on North Campus (25 per
cent), lack of an academic atmosphere on North
Campus (24 per cent), and lack of rule enforcement
by student officers (21 per cent).

The 150 students who said that there was a North
Campus Problem listed me lack of an academic
atmosphere on North Campus as the biggest prob-
lem (61 per cent cited that as a problem). Mobility
on North Campus and property damage was the
next largest concern of this group (53 per cent
noted this area as a problem).

More Than Grinnell

We feel that there are things more important than
that which transpires at Grinnell. Because we feel this
way we have an exchange column, we go to Selma and
we do poverty issues and cover peace marches. We
have an active interest in things which involve thous~
ands of other students as well as things which involve
everyone in the country. The Scarlet and Black is com~
mitted to the belief that there is more that can be done
than obsequiously and unimaginatively sitting and
contemplating an indefensibly stagnant status quo.

Because we feel that the status quo at Grinnell is
unsatisfactory and because we feel that there is some-
thing beyond the confines of our “quiet community of
young scholars,” we are starting this week a three-part
series rather grandly entitled: The Liberal Liberal Arts
College and Its Students.

The first part of the series deals with Reed College
in Portland, Oregon (see page 7). The other two parts
will deal with Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio,
Ind Carleton College in N orthfield, Minnesota

We will admit now that we go into the series with
a bias. The bias is simply that we don‘t believe Grinnell
is making progress towards becoming more liberal. A
kind of preservist attitude prevails. We have chosen
Reed because it is more academically liberal than Grin—
nell. We have chosen Antioch for its unique academic
approach and its liberal social outlook. Carleton was
chosen to show that one can be more liberal than Grin-
nell and still be in the Midwest Conference.

The stories have been written by students at the
colleges under consideration and consequently reflect
a certain lack of objectivity.

We Will not contend that any of the colleges chosen
for examination are perfect. We are not suggesting that
all of the features of these colleges should or could be
incorporated at Grinnell. Rather we ask you — per-
haps implore is a better word — to carefully consider
Grinnell’s attitudes and rules in comparison to the
colleges we are presenting to and for you.

Need ‘Rockei Men'

We’ve waited long enough without saying anything
-and since we missed April Fools’ Day I feel obligated
to mention it. Where the hell are the nine remaining
installments in “King of the Rocket Men”? While the
rest of the country is caught up in low, high, and mass
camp, Grinnell remains uncertain as to what its policy
should be with regard to this phenomenon. We had in
our hands a treasure of the pop art world — an original
"so bad it's good” Hollywood flick—and we’re missing
a tremendous opportunity. We want Rocket Man.

Anti-Intellectual?

To lhe Editor:

I would like to make one comment with l‘e<
gard lo your editorial concerning the Executive
Council's report on the residence halls. You
are at course entitled to your opinion concern-
ing the report, and I do not wish to argue with
you in this letter. I would like lo point bul, how-
ever, that i see no evidence in the report {or
your comment that {he xepim assumes “Thai
antrinteileclualism runs rampant now on North
Campus.” In considering the matter of rash
dence halls and in writing if: report, the Couna
cil intended to consider possible constructive
changes which would enhance the intellectual
climate of the campus, and not to recommend
punitive measures or to pass judgment on the
plesent situation. 1 submit that a careful read-
ing of the report would make our outlook Clear.

To the Edltnr:

The “iron triangle" analogy excerpted from

find that Mr. Goddard is so well aware of our

out an investigated basis. After all he does

To the Editor:

mic is u you call "silly boy?” Who is if you
tell to be iree? At our time in life, few are
fortunate enough in be Stephen Dedalus. Can
you expect someone to be Bloom, when few
are yet Stephen? Are you the Molly whn will
he fulfilment for Bloom?

You say talk to you of Sartre; Sartre who
says, “Values are sown an my path as thou-
sands of little, or real demands, like the signs
which order us [0 keep off the grass (L’Etre
et le Neant)." IS it no wonder then that one
will aid: you in a movie, rather than to walk
on the grass? Sartre goes on m say, “Thus
the being or value qua value is lhe being of
what does not have being." When you say to
he free, how do yoll escape this?

Before you-call one “silly boy," remember
the words of Almustafu:

iar you can only be free when even the

desire of seeking freedom becomes a har-

ness to you, and when you cease m speak
of freedom as a goal and a fulfilment.

Freedom lhus becomes a fetter to a grealer
freedom, and is no longer value qua value.

when you say, “a day like this and days

Friday. April 3. lm

like it to come are zoo few to spend alone
. . .” it seems that you accuse “silly boy" of
not seeking you out. Yet why do you not seek
lllm out? is to remain anonymous to seek one
am? Are there not many to seek?

To be without another’s physical presence;
is [his to he alone as you intimate? I think
not. As the prophet says, to stand naked in
the soul against the wind, in walk the eanh
with bare feet to feel etc. . . . could one ever
thus be alone? Nor is to whisper a haiku, l0
call u puem — these are iew or many ways
to be with something beyond one's self.

Physical presence, too, is often needed and
very important. But to merely talk of Niela
zsche, Blake, Sartre or spring is homing un<
less there is sharing. To merely talk of ab-
slraction requires no verve, verve that is so
important to live the life you seem to advo-
Cate. Here i can only repeat what you have
said in another way.

Aristotle. rightly i believe, states that to
have knowledge, one must first have experi-
ence. Thus the degree of youth in a person
(in contradislincliun lo maturity) is deter-
mined by the person's experience. Is it no
wonder then that at our age we are all not lo
some degree “silly boys"?

To wade in a pool, to pick some flowers, to
drink some wine, to fly a kite Ihave done
these things many tunes. Yet, i am siill a
“silly boy.” In the world I live in here at
Grinnell, I find the Values are sown along my
path almost wherever I siep to find experla
ence and knowledge. I have found few to seek
and still fewer who seek. “Silly girl,” why
do you not seek me and the many like me
here? We have kites, bare feet, desires . . .

'Giass Menagerie' Brilliant;
’ Steiner's Cast Rates Praise

By BRUCE MCCONASHIE

”The Glass Menagerie" opened
Tuesday night to a toll house in
the Arena Theatre. The enact-
ment at Tennessee Williams' mo-

dern classic fully merited the [re
mendous reception given it by the
Grinnell audience. l-ieniy - York
Steiner’s (English) direction or the
play was often subtle and imagin-
atlve,

The play began at a last pace——
tun last, I fell, for the audience
to achieve an emphatic under-
standing of the action. The acting
throughout the (list part was good
but one was never really allowed
to become deeply involved in the
pathos of each character’: situa-
tion. Thus some parts of the play
seemed more comic than Wil-
liams probably intended them. Cab
tainly the scene between Tom and
Laura after Torn comes home
from a night or drinking is funny.
But one laughs, ithink, on the
wrong side of one's race. Aman-
da‘s “rise and Shine," is comedy
with a pathetic note.

Pace Slowed

The pace slowed down atter in.
termlssion and we were given
richer and more subtle characteris
zation. The action rose smoothly
to the ClimaXvihe scene between
Laura and the gentleman caller—
and we experienced a tremendous
sense of loss at Laura's disillus-
ionment. Tom's poetic ending leit
its with a Vivid impression of the
oppressive sorrow ielt by all the
characters.

Certainly the most effective as-
pect of the production, besides the
acting, was the music. The nos-
talgic (one could almost say
“camp") jazz train the dance hall
and Laura's record player went

 

far toward establishing the domin-
ant mood of the play.

Yet i was puzzled by other or
Steiner's technical effects. The
sign over the lire escape seemed
gimmicky and superfluous. At
times, the illumination DI the pic-
ture ot the father distracted from
the play. The lights were a hit
too dim during some scenes but
the lighting of other scenes was
superb, particularly the scene be-
tween Laura and the gentleman
callers

Bothered by Set

i was bothered by the set.
While it may be argued that the
baseboards deiine the acting area
much more clearly than the lights
ever could. I see no reason to
erect wooden rods between the
floor Ind ceiling to define wall
space. In hisjirst narrative speech
Tom says that this play will give
us the “reallty of illusion." Both
the baseboards and the wooden
rods push the play toward the “il-
lusion or reality."

But this is quibbling, Such minor
detects become practically insig-
niticant when compared to the ef-
fectiveness of the acting. Steiner
must be applauded tor his excel~
lence in casting. The physical
characteristics and voice qualities
at each actor seemed to match
perfectly the role that each por-
trayed.

Ken Hicks gave us a suit-spoken,
sensitive Tom. I would have liked
to have seen more bitterness and
frustration in his interpretation of
the role; however, Ken's quick,
nervous movements eliectively dis-
played Tom‘s uncomfortable situa-
tion. On the Whole, an admirable
performance.

Roosevelt U. Newspaper Stall Quits;
Administration Moves Cause Rebellion

The Roosevelt Torch. newspaper
of Roosevelt University, Chicago,
lllinois, has suspended operations
due to animosities between its
stall and the administration.

The incident which touched off
the suspension was an "arbitrary"
decision by the University Control-
ler to refuse the staff permission
to stay late in the building com-
posing their issue on a Friday
night. The start was pushing it~
selt to complete a twenty - eight
page paper by Friday night and
had already stayed in the building
until midnight and 1:00 am. on
previous nights.

However, on Friday night alter
the staff refused to leave at 10:30
and permission had not been
granted {or them to remain, a po-
lice escort was sent by the admin-
istration to evacuate them, The

staff was escorted out and conse-
quently the paper was not coni-
pleted until Saturday night.

The Torch stall became in-
censed to such a degree that they
will not publish the paper unless
the administration meets these
demands: (1) The editor, business
manager, and production manager
selected by the staff; (2) a for-
mal judicial system be established
for processmg grievances against
the Tamil; (3) the Torch be al-
luwed access to all administrative
and iaculty committees and all
University documents be opened
tor paper's inspection; (4) that
the Torch eventually become com-
pletely autonomous from the Ulti-
versity through a corporation; and
(5) that only the student govern»
ment have the authority to ap-
prove Torch deticit and repayment
plans.

play. Karyn Zimmerman did an
outstanding job in this key role,
Her characterization, especially in
the second part, was nearly excel-
lent. Every voice inilection, every
gesture was right. I felt that her
action throughout was well motivat-
ed and thus, finally, depressingly
believable. Karyn’s ettecilveness
was aided by excellent costuining.
A heavy maroon sweater hanging
loosely trom her shoulders poign-
antly clashed with her southern-
belle airs.

Debbie Abbott, who portrayed
Laura, gave an effective charac-
terization of a terribly shy per-
son. Especially noteworthy, I
think. is her good sense or tim-
ing. Perhaps Laura's nervousness
was overacted in a few placer,
but never to the extent that she
became unbelievable. _‘

The part of Jim, the gentleman
caller, was played by Chuck
Bums. I agree with Chuck's inteF
pretatlon of this role: Jim is I
nice guy but he's also a jerk.
Chuck handled his part easily and,
with the exception of when he
kissed Laura, his performance
was quite good.

cited layout, photography, writing
skills and creative work by the
stair as the paper's strong points.

The First Class rating repre-
sents an improved rating for the

year the paper was rated Second
Class.

John Wolf said, when told of ﬁll
award, “We deserved it."

The citation said that “creativity
is your strongest point." it went
on to say that “the issue on pov-
erty in Chicago, Des Moines, and
Grinnell was very well done.”

S& B Interviews lecturer leonard Meyer

ED. NOTE: The following is a
transcription of an interview be.
tween S d: B staff writer linda
Seckelson and Dr. Lennard Mey-

“ or who visited and lectured on
campus this week.

s it oi What is your feeling as
to the legitimacy of serial and
randomly or arbitrarily composed
music, and what kind of audience
is going to respond to these new

' avant-garde art forms? 7

Meyer: First. of all, there’s a
big difference between serial mile
sic and random music. I don't
quite know what legitimate means.
I think that complex music is very
difficult for most audiences to
perceive and I would be inclined
to feel that there aie two mitigat-
ing circumstances. First, we must
give up our past expectations that
we have on past art, . that
everybody is going to like the
some art. 1 think that one must
no longer bemoan the fact that
the Washerwomen does not ride

anything yotl wanted, in a sense
you couldnt compose because you
can't compose when you have
complete freedom; you must have
some kind of limitation. And the
second problem is that if yoii are
going to write a non-tonal music,
you have to be consistent and it
would be unfair 'writing a non»
tonal music to hit upon, as it were.
by chance, combinations which be-
long to the system of tonality but
which you have no intentions of re-
solving in your system. So the
rules of serial music were devised
essentially to do two things: to
limit the composer's choices so that
he is able to choose and to try
insofar as is possible to insure
that the kind of syntatical sounds
which arise in tonal music do not
arise in this music, so that you
will not arouse false expectations
of certain kinds of resolutions.
More. extreme forms of serialism
create real problems for the au ‘
ence. I don't think that it’s illig

timate. but I think it has Certain
inherent limitations dut‘.I to the li-
mitations of the human mind and

Joyce, I don’t think she ever will i memory. The music is very lion-

. ride the State Street car reading
James Joyce. Therefore, it you
speak about serial music, I don’t
think that serial music is going
to in the forseeable future have
a very large audience.

Serial Music
Is Legitimale

llllllllllllllllllllIIlllllIIlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllilllllllIIlllllIlllllllllllll

To answer your question directr
)y, I’m saying that surely serial
music is legitimate. Serial music
is music which is carefully organ-
Izetl, and I think that serial music
has aesthetic problems, but in
qua-serial music, all that the ser-
Ial composer is doing is establish-
lrlg certain kinds of limitations for
the choices he makes.

There are two problems with
writing otonal music. The first
problem is t'nt itivou could write

 

redundant, it has voly lltile obvi-
ous patient. But this IS in a sense
compensated for by the existence
of technological redundancy, in the
form of tape recorders, recordings,
and so on. That is, it would be
impossible to learn the music oi
Boulez if you Could lislen to the
piece only occasionally as was the
Case in the eighteenth century.
But given the fact that you have
recordings, it is possible to learn
this music.

I think that non-predictability.
total non . predictability “syni-
gates" the spirit of man. 0n the
other hand, I think their view is
defensible, namely, that its pur-
poses, predictions, goals, striv-
ings, which, from their point oi
View, have gotten us into the
mess we’re in, that the anguish
that men feel is the result of the
kinds of expectations they have
about the world, and If you give
up all these things, as you must
if you’re. going to listen to

, historians

dom music, then you can live in
‘a kind of contemplative bliss. As
tar as the legitimacy - illegitimacy
question goes, i don’t know why
it should be illegitimate, or on
what grounds one would say it

was illegitimate. ,

S 8; B: Traditionally, there have
been two aspects in musical cre-
ation. The one is composition and
the other is performance. In elec
tronic music, at least. in taped
music, this second element is elim»
inated. in your opinion how does
this affect the quality of the
achievement. it at all, and how

does it affect the musical exper-
ience of the listener?

MEYER: My own feeling is that
performance is very important.
There are at least two serious li-
mitations to taped music. One is
the fact that for most listeners,
the visual experience of the motor
action of people in performing
music is an important part of their
musical experience, and this is
eliminated in taped music.

lllIIillllIIIlllllllilllllllllllllllllllllllllllllillillllliilllllllIIlllliiiiillllliliillllllit

Canned Music— ,
No Uncertainty

IlllllllliilllllllllllllIIIlllllllllllllllilllliliillllliittlllllilillllllllllllllIIilllllIIllli

The second thing is that the ele
ment or uncertainty, which is a de—
iighiiul and important element in
in listening to music is also miss-
ing in any canned performance,
whether tape or record. And the
third thing which I teel is missing
on a record or a tape is the possi
bility of certain kinds of subtle niir
ances in performance which in
one sense change tlle work. it you
had a canned piece and you lis-
tened to it over and over again,
it wears itself out- and you get
tired of “X's” performance, \vhe<
that it's of a Beethoven symphony
oi- anytiiing else.

Again, my whole thesis is lliat
we face a period or pluralism oi
all these tradiiicnsinot just the
tradilions pt elite music, but those
of folk music and popular music
will exist Side by side and cone
timie indelinitcly.

5 & B: The anthropologist A. L.
Kroeber reels that style change in
ciVlllZzilion takes place when the
eXlsling style has been fully ex-
ploited, has reached a point of ex-
haustion. Do you agree with this
theory?

MEYER: Yes, Ki‘oeber feels
also that a style must constantly
grow and develop or it will grow
decadent and die. lt scents to me
that this is not the Case. The the-
ory is a very douhlhil thing, part-
ly because the exhaustion theory
involves a kind or value judg-
merit about style. What would con—
stitute the exhaustion or a style?
One could sayrthat it nobody wrote
in the sryle it would be considered
to be exhausted. It’s true that soon-
er or later styles change, but I
don’t think that this inevitably
happens. If you look at other cul<
tures, it becomes. clear thay they
have been much more stable Styl-
istically than Western culture for
the last 500 years. "that doesn't
mean that other cultures haven’t
changed at times but there have
been long periods of stability. The
other thing that happens is that
and

 

 

anthropologists

looking at other cultures tend to
discover in them the kinds of de-
vclopments seen in Western cul-
ture and than analyze them in
those terms and create parallels.
Tlle thesis that an art
form must develop or it dies or
decays is an extrapolation from
recent \Vesterii history. Mr, Foster
Monday at the coffee hour sug-
gested the possibility that things
will converge. Certainly is is pos
sible that things today will con-
verge. The thing that I’m consid-
ering that nobody else wants to
consider is that maybe it won't con-
verge, and I think that there are
all kinds oi signs that things won’t
converge in the near future.

‘Convergence.’
Nol Expected

lllllllllllllillllIIIlllllllIIllllllIIilllllliilillllliiilllllililllllllilllliiiillllllllllllll

s 8: B: What are they?

MEYER: First Of all, the;
demise of the idea of progress
which has been a force for con-
vergence and change in this sense.
The decline, and the emphasis on
individualism, which has also been

something which made for con-.

vergence and for dependence on
earlier styles. AlSo, in some sense
the paths toward some sort of
convergence seem to me have
been exhausted.

It’s agiless. Btu, the important
thing about the guess is that it
changes one’s whole view of what
the present is like it you make
that guess. That is, it you keep
looking at the present as though
you expected convergence, then
you look at Stockhausen on the
one hand and Samual Barber on

the other aild say "which is going
to Win?" Pluralism creates anxi-
ety only when you expect it to
be monistic. But once you say
you're going to have a “pluralis
tic status," then your whole atti»
tude toward what’s going on in the
world becomes less anxious.

S 8: Now that we’ve “done
Kroeber i " do you have an alter-
native hypothesis tor the catise of
style change?

tlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllltlllllllllllllllltlll

‘Gh Gawdl'
Wild Question

IlllllllllllllllllillllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllIIIlllllllllilllllllllllllllillllllllllillll

MEYER: 0h Gawd, that’s R
wild question! First of all, I
think that there are differences,

 

and he would make tyhese distinC<
thins, too, between changes which
take place within a style, which
he calls kinetic changes, and
changes which take place among
various styles . . t In music, tor
instance, what happens in a Style
is that you start off with a style
which has, for the sake of learn-
ing, a very high degree of redund.
ancy. As the listeners in that cul-
ture leam that style, it becomes
less redundant, and you reach a
kind of stable period in the style,
and then at some point, the ire
formation rate increases again
and you have a very low redund~
ancyt What culture changes is the
rate of change, not primarily the
direction. After all, the Classical
style runs through the American
Revolution, the French Revolution,
the Industrial Revolution but the

style does not undergo ally basic
change.

Now what happens between
styles is another question, and
I’m not at all sure what Causes
those changes. It doesn’t necessar-
ily follow that there is a one to
one correlation between culiule
and style.

llllllllllllllIIllllllllnlllltIIIlllllllllillllllltllllliliillllliiillllllliilllllliilllllltn

Style Evolution
Big Question

.llliiillllllilllllllIIllllllillllllltlllillllllllllllllilillllliiilllllliiillllllilllllliiillll

Those who say that there is
such a Correlation have done so
because they equate representa<
tional Content with style. It’s quite
clear that David, for instance, was
in a veiy simple-minded sense in<

. ﬂuenced by the French Revolution

or by the Napoleonic Era because
he paints Napoleon and he paints
the Death of Marat. What one is
interested in in Beethoven is not
whether he had half-baked notions
about freedom, which he lllCOinOi‘v
ated into the Ninth Symphony,
but how does the style evolve.
Dickens was thematically coil-
Cei‘neti with the events of his
day, but the question you have to
ask is why does he put words to-
geiher the way he does. One oi
the interesting evidences, at least
in literaure, against the one lCl
one correspondence theory is that
if there were a one to one CDi'l'ES'
pnndence between culture and lit-
erature, then the vernacular lang-
uage would be the same as the
art language at all times. But in
tact vemacular language deviaies
ii-nm art language. They may con-
verge at certain points, but then
they separate.

So I’m by no means certain as
to how styles evolve, what starts
them off , . . Once a style he
gins it tends to have Its own way
of moving. While it may he pos-
sible to talk about exhausting a
style, . . . ! dont think that it
is necessarily the case that a style
does become exhausted. It might
become exhausted. While styles
may change, it isn't a law of hi9
tory that they must change.

earned the folkdancers' pet name,
“the harem one." Displaying pro

The concert will open with an
Israeli medley of 14 daitces,the
first of which will be Ken Yovdu.
Literally, Ken Yovdu means “thus
they will perish.” The lolkdance
leader and teacher, Mrs. Pierko
Roecker. explains that ”the ‘thus
will they perish' refers to the ene-
mies of Israel.” She describes it
as a “militant, defiant dance.“
Ken andu will be [allowed by Nad

done in the familiar Israeli Circle
form.

Other highlights or the perfor-

One or the most interesting tolk
histories behind a dance is the
derivation of Constant Billy. This
is one or a group oi ancient Eng-

as Morris dances (from the word
Moorish). Every village had its
Morris men, which was a respect-

their dances and ritual on the

Past Spring Riots Cause Current Concern

By KRISTI RENNEBOHM

The Senate is now in the process
of reevaluating Spring Riot in
terms of its mounting property
damage and bills from BXLGT A
review of past Spring Riots re
veals the validity of their concern.

On Tuesday night, May 9, 1961,
North Campus men invaded the
Quad and remained inside the
locked loggia after hours. Fortun»
ately, the would-be riot caused lit-
the damage. Costs came to ap-
proximately $10.00.

The Riot on Wednesday, April
25, 1962, was a diiierent story. The
hall presidents were kidnapped
and taken to a deserted school-
house. According to the S St B re
port, the riot “was not an lrre
sponsible student outburst” but
rather“‘a well planned affair con-
trolled by various student lead-
ers.” The S 8: B regarded it as “a
substitute for the potentially dan-
gerous panty raid type of nut-
burst.” It stated that there was
"no malicious damage inflicted to
property in the incident.” How
ever, costs ran up to $117.39 in
addition to the $183.50 fine paid
by students for vandalism.

On Sunday night, May 5, 1963,
one of the longest and noisiest
water fights in the hisotry of Grin-
nell took place on North Campus.
Approximately 150 students had the
pleasure of drenching and drown-
ing one another,

0n the following evening, May 6,
another unofficial riot began with
the Burling library lights being
cut off. This was followed by men
breaking into the women’s dorms.
This riot turned out to be one oi
the most successful ones in the his»
tory of Grinnell.

That same week, on Tuesday
night, May 7, the oiiicially planned
Spring Riot took place, The com?
and AWS board members were
kidnapped and a dance was held.

) Senate

(Continued trorn Page 1)

spoke against the resolution, point-
ing out that halls lacked the power
to collect assessments against indi-
viduals.

Bob Foote answered that stu-
dents who fail to pay hall ﬁnes
may be taken to the Pr la ry
Court, Where an additionai fine is
possible, and that students who
rail to pay court tines may be
brought to the attention of the
Faculty Committee on Student Ai-
fairs.

Another part of the resolution
notifies the Student Auditor “that
it would be unwise to have hall
social tunds used to pay for dani—
ages.”

The Senate also sent to the ad-
ministration a proposal to extend
telephone hours to one hali hour
after the present women’s hours.
Ron Fiscus reported that 65 per
cent of the questionnaires returned
favored that particular time.

And the Senate continued its

concern with the most prominent is»

me of the last SGA‘ campaign:
ltudent involvement. Currently the
Senate and Coil-[P are organizing
committees to examine (a) the
tar-rule; (b) the Men's Primary
Court; (c) college transportation;
((1) curricular, affairs; (e) open
rooms; and (1) Building and!
Grounds.

 

Activities ended quietly at mid-
night as the students were exhaust-
ed from the previous two riots.
The total cost at these three riots
was approximately $140.00.

In the spring of 1964, another
successful riot was held. The elec-
tricity on campus was turned off
in all buildings. Water fights went
on all over North Campus and a
dance was held on the roof of
Cowles. The good time that was
had by the students cost $244.93.

On Tuesday, May 4, 1965. a

fight broke out on North Campus
which turned into a spontaneous
riot. It migrated to South Campus
where the rioters broke into the
loggia at 12:30 am. Students wan-
dered around and marched
through the loggia. Attempts
were made to get the girls out»
side either on their own accord
or by force. The unofficial riot
ended at 1:45 am Damage was
remarkably light —- two windows
and locks were broken and a few
screens were pushed out.

On the following Thursday, May
6, 1965, the ofﬁcial Spring Riot
took place. There were fireworks,
water tights and “happy” Grin-
nellians ﬂoating around Broken
glass and small fires were seen
around campus. The total bill for
these two riots came to $999.85

The high cost of damage done
during the riots at Grinnell is the
reason for Senate's concern and
re-evaluation of the traditional
Spring Riot.

The Liberal Liberal Arts College and Its Students: Part |

.A endemic life Stressed at Reed College

ED. NOTE: In the first in a series
on the “Liberal Arts College and its
Students," junior philosophy major
at Reed Rene Ballard writes about
keed College’s liberal policies and the
academic pressures which seem to
keep students ironi enjoying them.

A iairly reliable index of the charac-
ter of any college, 1 think, is the kind of
person it tries to make of its students.
College administrators are not always
candid in explaining the kind of College
they direct — I am not at all certain
even what Reed is supposed to be ~ but
Reed possesses an appealing simplicity
in the clarity and immediacy with which
it becomes evident to the ﬁrst year stu<
dent that Reed is dedicated to producing
academicians. what is not so appealing
is the degree to which this dedication

_ excludes nearly everything else.

In a way this directed narrowness
makes Reed a simple place to describe.
There are no fraternities, ior instance.
Nor are there intercollegiate athletics.
Much of the extra-curricular activity
common to other colleges does not exist
at Reed. But in a way it gives Reed a
certain complexity, ior the institution is
generally far more dedicated to academ-
ics than are the Students. Hence there
is a perceptible divergence between the
iomlal structure and the actual work-
ings of the college.

One of the paradoxical things about
Reed is that the college iS as notable for
the freedom it allows the Students as ior
its academic rigor. There are low spe<
ciﬁc rules; theoretically the student is
tree to do as he wishes as long as he
does not impair the rights of others.
However the college seems to extend
with one hand unparalleled social free-
dom only to rescind with the other the
opportunity to use it by imposlng an
academic burden which if taken serious-
ly leaves almost no time for anything
but working.

And at Reed the student who has had
little introduction to the discipline re<
qllired of the serious Academician is at-
tracted by Reed's standards and Reed’s
freedom. Once at Reed, however, he
otten learns two things: one. that he is
less inclined academically than he had
imagined, or two, that he is more cre<
arively inclined than Reed gives him
room to be. Creative work at Reed is
minuscule. Thus about on per cent of the
entering students leave Reed. Many or
those who stay do so with dislike or con-
tempt ior Reed, many simply out of un-
certainty. Not many are willing to sur-
render the freedom at Reed (or the re
strictlons common to other colleges; but
not many remain at Reed for more sub-
stantial or more positive reasons. Corl-
sequently there is a lot of confusion
among Reed students about themselves
and about Reed.

llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll

Most ‘Eschew'
Middle Class

llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll

it is much easier to describe what
Reed students do than what they think.
Most of them, for instance, eschew
middle class avalues and deride the
peaceful asininities of our society. And
however dissatislied they might become
with Reed, none are dissatisfied with the
policy of excluding fraternities and ath-
letics, etc., which seem to be lower level
complements of much of the nonsense oi
adult society. But if Reed students are
revolutionary they are so in a quiet way.
Most of them just look revolutionary:
they are in the summers and quite utten
during vacations temporarily and palm
lessly reintegrated into society, and after
Reed, usually permanently reintegrated.
A lot of them might favor a modification
of society's sexual mores and a lot of
them like socialism. But if anything, they
are ~ not subversive — just avantrgarde

THE ACADEMIC up: is the most important at Reed but it often takes a
very informal nature — at is the care above.

Reed has generally attracted the more
able and intellectually motivated high
school students. Yet students of this
category are also often times artistically
motivated. I would venture this guess.
even, that their interests tend to be more
broad than that of the average student.

which, l grant, is reheshing to someone
like myselt who has endured the provin-
ciallsm of the Midwest.

At any rate, the important thing is tor
all of their radicalism at Reed, not many
have given much thought to the applica-

tion of radical ideas once out of Reed.
What relevance or importance there
might be for society at large in the
values of the Reed society is not clear
to very many — perhaps to none. Never-
theless most derive a Certain Satisfaction
from Reed: reputation as a hotbed ni
subversives and dupes and a certain
primitive obligation to perpetuate it. In
this case society is the dope — particu-
larly Portland. Although there are Com<
munists (of intellectual persuasion at
least) at Reed, no one tinds it particular.
ly noteworthy, not because everyone is in
sympathy but because the existence at
political diversity is taken for granted.
Few Reed students would seriously hear
an argument which took it for granted
that Communism is prima facie unac-

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nearly 24 hours daily. Heretoiore there
has been little attempt to adopt the use
sumption that the average college stu-
dent is so ltkely to make serious mis-
takes, affecting himseli only or others as
well, that his major decisions have to be
made for him by those who possess the
requisite knowledge and virtue.

here approach such questions academ-

taken ior acceptance.

Not Much Time
For Opposition

Illlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll

There is little political activity on cam—
pus. Most students are opposed to the
war in Viet Nam, but few spent much
time in active opposition. For the most
part the time for organized political
work cannot be spared.

With very few exceptions Reed stu-
dents ore mature enough to meet the re~
sponsibility which accompanies the free-
dom at Reed. Most of them are eager to
assume the responsibility. Often in other
colleges rules become. with the willing
acceptance of students, defenses ior tut-
tering personal values, substituting for-
mal prescription for the lack of comic
tion. Little of this exists at Reed. Stu-
dents here consider one’s social life,
panicularly one’s sexual liie, one’s own

business. lntervisitationislliberal, and _

recent proposals move to extend it to

ministration, and faculty. All of this is
created by, and helps to perpetuate, a
substantially mature student body. But
Reed social life suiiers from the ener<
vating work load. There is, to me at
least, a pervasive fugitive quality in al-
most all Reed social life. In fact, not
much social life exists, So in a Sense do.
bates about the direction of communlty
aliairs are only so much sound and tut-y.
In another sense. perhaps, they are not,
for the Stolen moments of leisure are, to
many, threads on which one’s sanity
hangs.

Probably the most certain thing that
can be Said about the Reed student is
that he is definite about What he does not
like — middle class values, conlcrrnity
for its own sake, political orthodoxy,
muddled thinking in general, halfway
approaches to education — but terribly
uncertain about what he does like ‘ the
values by which he shall live, his own
interest in education. his own aims and
designs vis—a-vis the ones he has con-
demned as narrow, common, and un -
teresting. And the most certain thing
about Reed is that it is difficult if not imr
possible here to discover the answers to
these sorts of questions. To the student
firmly resolved to pursue the academic
liie Reed is one of the best places, But
to the student still uncertain. Reed is
one of the worst.

Des Moines Proiec’r's Plans

The Des Moines Project student
group on campus under the lead-
ership of Bill Downey is continu-
in; its involvement in the hous-
iiig problems or the “Capital.”

At this point the group is tak-
itig surveys based on complaints
or residents in some oi the poorer
disllicts of Des Moiiies. These will
be used for iurther rent strikes and
attempts to raise the standards or
llvmg in these areas.

The Project is also working to
ward this summer and a projected
vacation — long struggle with the
troubles oi the poverty - ridden
parts at the city. They are look-
ing tor people who would be will-
ing to spend their vacation doing
this.

Downey stated that [his was still
one oi their problems: people will-
ing to become a permanent part
of the group. of course, anybody

willing to give any time is we]-
coined,
One oi the bigger problems is

that ol iinahcial support. The prorl
the '

ject received $425.00 from
SAGA inst, but this is not enough.
Downey stated, "We're attempt
log to get iinancial help from the
SDS Midwest Regional Organizing
Conference, but with little luck so
far.”

The group still meets on Tues-
days at 10 pm. arid any inter-
ested in ﬁnding out anything about
the group’s activities is invttedi
Downey also stated that Billy
King, the project organizer in Des
Moines, may be on campus next
Week.

Downey went on to say that, as
far as the group itself is con-
cerned, they were in the process
oi ending activities tor the year.

Last week John Wolf advertised

ly announced that they are gone.
The bulk of the chicks went to

dividuals on campus. Wolf said

Advice is sought on a wide range
or issues, summer set-Vice pro-
jecls, religious belieis, sex ethics.
and home lile. Because of home
problems, the number or counsel-
ing appointments generally picks
up alter vacations.

Although functioning in a coun-
seling capacity has brought Eld-
i‘i‘dge close to a wide cross secs
tion of the student body, “the
time demands involved have ham-
pered tollowing through on other
responsibilities and terms at par-
ticipation in campus life." He ad-
voca s an expansion oi counseling

not be so dependent on the chat»
lain’s office and would have a
broader base in aiding students.

In the relationship or the chap-
loiiicy to the iaculty iaction oi the
campus community, Eldridge has
found much cooperation, especial-
ly with such programs as the race
series dinners, nuclear War dis—
cussions, and student-faculty di—
ciission groups. Much progress has
been made in the past three years
in student involvement in more
relevant and responsible activities.
These include the Inner City Semi-
nars in which students take OK
for urban areas during Christmas
and spring vacation to study and
experience the reality or poverty
in the city; REACH, a program

involving tutoring or children in
town by college students and other
means oi improving towncollegc
relations; and the Des Momes
Project, in which students aid in
developing and improving a pov-
erty pocket area in Des Moines.

Eldridge might be characterized
as “an idealistic young man,” his
cause being education, the liberal
arts and higher education ior min-
ority groups in particular. As chap-
lain he ﬁnds an outlet for this
idealism as chairman of the Na-
tional Association at College and
University Chaplains’ commission
on education for minority groups.
In this capacity he has not been
able to achieve many concrete
results (“although i have made it
lot of nice talks") because the
voluntary nature or the association.
limits the source of funds and
staff available.

Also confronting the college
chaplain are “more conferences
than he should go to.” In the past
month, Eldridge has traveled to
Evanston. Illinois, for a NACUC
conference and to St, Louis [or a
Daniorlh Foundation meeting. On
his agenda is a trip to Fisk Uni-
versity in NashVille, Tennessee.
where he will give a sermon and
meet with a seminar group.

Although the duties of the chap-
lain are demanding and diverse.
Eldridge's heavy schedule of Couli-
seling is easily evidenced by the
number of students emerging from
Steiner and stating, “He under-
stands me!”

 

will be mutual.

of the 292 who said there was

not a North Campus Problem, the
largest concern was for property
damage (28 per cent noted this as
ii problem). Privacy in the balls
(25 per cent) and noise levels in
the halls (21 per cent) were the
next largest areas of concern.
. oi the 292 who said there was
no North Campus Problem, 75
could find no problem that war»
ranted campus wide attention.

Men constituted about 65 per cent
of the respondents (309). They
were somewhat moie adamant

' about the non-existence at a North
Campus Problem. Sixty-eight per
tent of the men said there was niJ
problem. Only 49 per cent at the
women felt there was no North
Campus Problem (41 per cent said
there was and 11 per cent had no
opinion).

Men named property damage as
the largest problem (33 per cent
named it as a problem). The lack
of an academic atmosphere came
in a close second as the most rec-
ognized problem (29 per cent).
Noise and lack or privacy were
next in order (each drew 25 per
cent recognition as problem areas).

women agreed that property
damage was the biggest problem
on North Campus (38 per cent
checked it as a problem). Right
behind (with 37 per cent recogni-
tion) came privacy, 3 common
concern on South Campus these
days.

Several of those filling out the
survey made marginal notes. A
senior man commented on the
three suggestions [or changing the
system which were included in the
survey, saying that they “assume
that 18er year old Students are
still Children and incapable of con-
trolling themselves intelligently.”

A freshman man said that "the
problem is that the student en<
iorcement officers emphasize en-
forcing rules rather than promot»
ing an attitude oi concern in all
hall residents {or their fellows.”

The concept oi a North Campus
Problem was “not that clear cut"
to one sophomore woman, She said
that she thinks “there's a lack of
responsibility on campus but not
something that hall changes would
correct.”

with those ol‘ Hungarian folk inu-
sic. The work is continuous in its
setting; solos are presented in
quartet style; full orchestra ac-
companies the choir.

Carl Orfi, on the other hand, is
more than a muSlclan; his work
has a theatrical flair. Pen
formances of the Carmina Burana
usually involves staging. Unlike
the Te Deum, this piece is not
continuous. It is a sectiondlized
composition including closed solo

rhythm, and ruin Inﬂuence.

The text comes from a book of
poems discovered in a Benedictine
monastery in Southern Bermany
near Orif’s birthplace. The poems
are secular in nature and were
written by monks who had elicitly
gone to town and indulged them-
selves. The text deals with the joys
of living, world pleasures, and
the joys and sorrows oi drinking.
The text, in combination with the
music, results in an exciting, mu-
sically and dramatically colorful
work. The conductor, Denis de Co~
teau says of the Carmina from
the perfurmer’s standpoint: "Al-
though it's a serious work, it’s a
work for pure enjoyment."

important one in the area oi line

Debicki Decries Intellectual Slack
As Frosh Gradual y Become Seniors

By ALAN AXELROD

“In making proposals to the Ad
Hoc Committee on Hall Reorgani-
zation the Executive Council at»
tempted to formulate something
which would be beneflcial to the
College community, not try to take
over the role of college disciplin—
arians."

In an interview Wednesday, An-
drew Dehicki (Spanish) revealed
some of the thought behind the
proposals that included freshman
dorms and l system oi North
Campus room drawings.

peblcki said he thoughhthat a
system at treshman halls would
make it easier for the freshmen
to ask questions and pursue means
lngful topics. “There was a gen-
eral consensus that students didn‘t
talk to each other enough about
extra-curricular intellectual activi-
ties." He pointed out that he
meant discussion that is not neces-
sarily about classroom work, but

 

lather topics that have provided'
enough stimulation that students
would be moved to do some ins
dependent thinking. “Sn often I
see students in my classes mere-
ly come to class, take notes, and
hand it back in a neat package
on tests, without ever asking ques-
tions. showing intellectual Curios-
ity."

Interestingly, Debicki said his
best discussions come in fresh-
man humanities classes. He re-
marked thst students seem to lose
their intellectual zeal gradually,
until when they are seniors, they
have, for the most part, lost the
spark, "Campus life is simply not
conducive to students getting to
gether and asking questions."

Debicki said he wanted to make
it clear that he does not consider
the residence hall system to be
culpable for all the flaws in the
intellectual atmosphere. He does,
however. feel that it is time for
a change, and feels, as Preslden!
Legget does, that in any system

 

 

an occasional change is needed
to add Vitality. “Any system after
a number of years is caught up
in its own mystique. The inertia
within the system perpetuates tra-
ditiun.

“It is uniortunare that energies
are being channeled into a direc-
tion that isn't worth it. The kind
of inﬂuence exerted on the fresh-
men by upperclassmen in particu-
lar halls is bad. it is my impres-
sion that the freshmen are often
made to conform to detailed and
trivial regulations and problems of
importance are neglected."

Debicki emphasized that ideas
he had about the residence hall
system often came from the stu-
dents themselves. and that in talk—
ing with students on a personal
basis he cited iinds that they are,
in ﬂat, rather disenchanted with
the present residence hall system.

Another fault he ﬁnds with
North Campus is that it is diffi-
cult to choose one's own friends.
Debicki backed this up with com-
plaints he has had from students
who say that intermingling among
the halls is discouraged.

He commented that in freshman
dorms treshmen would be more
likely to seek out their peers for
discussions, and as he pointed out,
freshmen share a common bond
called humanities and historical
studies. Whereas the proposals
called for one upperclassman to
every eight or ten ireshmen, De-
bicki said he would perhaps like
to see more upperclassmen in the

that the success of freshmen
dorms would, to a large partpde-
pend on the upperclassmen in the

In regard to open dorms, De-

cil did not feel ready to make

Golfers look Toward New Season
As Risser. Shellenbarger Return

With only two of the five top

the Pioneer golfers will be hard

The two retumees are Ted Ris-

conference meet last year, and

"Dave Shellenbarger. Shellenbal‘g—
er played number five man most
of last year.

In addition to his conference
championship, Risser holds other
impressive credentials. As a soph-
omore he placed fifth in the con-
ference and both years he has
been in the top twenty - iive in
