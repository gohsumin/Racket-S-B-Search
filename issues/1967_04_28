Campus radio station
to operate next fall

by Mary Malcolm

Pending iinancing and administra-
tive approval, the Grinnell radio sta-
tion will set up its equipment this spring
and begin broadcasting in the tall, ac-
cording to Babak Arntajaitl, manager of
the embryonic station.

Arnlajani will have a functioning stati
of over 50 people by the ettd of next
week. SGA will subsidize the radio sta-
tion. Armajani said a college beneiac—
tor has pledged to match a fund drive
if additional money is needed. After the

Work on the proposed college radio
station will be delayed tor several
weeks until a FCC broadcasting li-
cense ls received from the district
office in Minneapolis.

lnitial installation costs, Armajani esti-
mates the minimal yearly cost for sal<
arias, maintenance and growth at
$1000.

The station will be registered with the
_FCC as an educational FM station. Ar-
majani explained that FM provides
higher quality sound, “so that we can
broadcast classical music without feel-
ing guilty about it," and is less expen-
sive and complicated to operate.

Since the idea of the radio Station
began two years ago with Armajani and
contact with other college stations, or-
ganizations and services providing pro-
grams, record companies, and the FCC.

The radio project was "adopted” by
a senate committee ullder the Kent ad
ministration. Present SGA president
nlc MacDowell appointed Armajani sta-
tion manager. Armajani appointed Cloud
personnel manager.

Armajani sees the radio station a lab-
oratory ior students at the social
aciences. The Station will provide op-
portunities for large numbers oi people
in journalism through news broadcast-
[rig and editing. It will otter opportulli~
ties in speech, business administration,
personnel work, and creative program-
ming. The Station will subscribe to the
UPI teletype Service and handle nation-
Al and international as well as campus

Senate debates Initiative
Fund. abolition of Riot

By Andy Isaacs

Senate controversy centered this week
around the initiative fund, the actions
of the college paper and “Spring Riot".

The resolution favoring the abolish<
ment of “Spring Riot" was designed
to spark discussion among the students.
Senators defeated a motion to establish
a committee on the riot, preferring to
discuss the matter as a body. Hoping
students would be more likely to ex<
press ideas to their individual senators
if a definite motion were made, the
Senate brought the motion to the floor
for discussion and tabled it until next
week to await student reaction.

Senators generally seemed to agree
that “Spring Riot” had little to recom-
mend itself. Ray Horn and Derrick
TePaske expressed the belief that few
people really enjoy the riot, while Mike
Pill suggested that setting aside one
Special day for letting loose tended to
create social pressure to conform to

Interim Court’s action
By Richard SchneirOV

Tuesday night the Interim Court con-
victed seniors James Stuart. Ken
Adelntan, James Drasdo, and juniors
Barry Nemmers and Dale Mossey oi
disorderly conduct during “Spring Riot.”

The court recommended that James
Stuart be expelled from the college.
They also recommended social expulsion
for Drasdo, and Adelman, and that they
not be allowed to participate in grad.
uation exercises. Social expulsion means
that the students involved would have
to leave the college campus by Satur<
day, April 29, and take their Senior
Comprehensive exams off campus.

It was recommended that Massey be
given social expulsion and conduct
probation for next semester and that
Nemmers also he put on conduct pro-
bation.

The Faculty Committee on Student
Affairs, with the Deans sitting in as
advisors, will shortly consider the recom-
mendations of the court and appeal:
by the tive delendants.

The case involved charges by David
Dillon and Adrienne Lemmons that the
five Cowles Hall members harrassed
them with water balloons and eggs
during ”Spring Riot.” The speciiic de
tails of the case were released to the
college community in a letter printed
in the Reporter last week signed by
both Dillon and Miss Lemn‘lons.

in judging the case members at the
court relied not only on evidence ob—
tained during “Spring Riot” but also
on past actions.

Witnesses testified to a “sick society"
in Cowles Hall. Rick Sprott, former
president of Cowles testified that a
“Dillon hate campaign has been going
on intermittently tor the last three years
and that nearly everybody in Cowles
has been involved in it at one time
or another.” He laid the blame on a
small group or approximately ten people
with James Stuart as the main influence.

Sprott went on to say, “This can-
not be handled a: one incident. It can
only be looked at as a larger problem.
There has been at complete lack of
respect for people in the Cowles com-
munity. . . it has gone beyond the
polntof fun."

He described how some students threw
Water balloons at visitors and at de-
livery boys from Ahrvano’s Pizza, how
paper clips were used to jam doorsn
how students anonymously telephoned
girls on South Campus to make dates
for other hall members; how doors were
burned down and Smashed in as “pranks”
and how certain members at the hall
were held up to ridicule.

He also told of the harassment of
girls who Came to the hall. “I'VE had
several girls who came into my room
in tears because of this.u

Spmtt related how he tried to control
the situation through tines, personal
conierences, consultation with resident
advisers, from other halls, Kenneth
Christianson, faculty adviser to Cowlés,
and finally Dean 3. Eugene Thompson.

Dr. Christianson (biology) Spoke at
the hearing backing up previous testi-
mony. He described Cowles Hall as
having a "Mafia”-like atmosphere —‘ot
vendetta - where people are afraid
to testify, The hall system in Cowles
has been totally unable to deal with
the problem."

A petition signed by 33 members at
Cowles Hall accusing the live defendant!
was also submitted as evidence. Dil<
lon said that earlier he had been wile
ling to settle for a public apology but
that many of the petition signers had
asked for a public airing of the case,

asked for penalties of conduct pro<

Editorials . . .

Does the penaltysolve the problem?

The Interim Court’s recommendation of expulsion for James
“The Brow”) Stewart and ”social expulsion” for James (“Flush”)
rasdo, Ken Adelman and Barry Nemmers is, we think, much too
severe and does little to remedy the unfortunate social situation in
Cowles and some of the other men’s halls.

. A better penalty would have been that recommended by Dave
Dillion ﬂ giving all the offenders “conduct probation.” We hope
the Faculty Committee on Student Affairs will intercede and enable
James Stewart to finish up his last three weeks and graduate from
Gl‘innell.

The problem raised by this case and by “Spring Riot" are
much deeper than Cowles “Zoo” and “The Brow;" making ex-

amples of and removing some of the most spectular Symptons won‘t
solve them.

Doing our iolo -

College newspaper staffs deal with a difficult group of readers.
If you work for a college paper, old journalistic “pros” will tell
you, “If you are not making them mad, you’re not doing your job."
Sometimes anger is the least of the reader’s sentiment against you;
more likely, the outside world conceives of you alternately as
children playing games or dangerous villans plotting dark deeds.
We take our role quite seriously though i a fact amusing to some
» and have a definite idea of what we are trying to do. We
"cover” the news at Grinnell College, yes. But we believe that real
news at Grinnell deserves a great deal more than mere cataloguing
of facts. The usual calendar of events belongs on a calendar or bul<
letin board, in mail boxes or, in the future perhaps, broadcast over
a college radio station. A college readership and students writing
for the paper demand something meatier anyway. Why take time,
space (always at a premium) and effort away from significant and
interesting topics.

At The Reporter, we consider one of our main functions to be
the story-behind-the-story. For this reason we kept asking questions
until we exposed the fire hazard of the locks on the women’s dorms,
until we had analyzed other college’s tuition plans alongside Grin-
nell’s own and until we had evaluated the future of the theatre
department here.

In a close community such as ours a readership is apt to be
very sensitive about what we print. But lest the readily defensive
reader forget, the good "digging” reporter will have access to in-
formation not available to the public’at-large and, therefore, a
greater basis for evaluating and interpreting such information.
Good "news analysis" is not taking “journalistic license” but rath-
er places issues in meaningful perspective. Isolated “facts" are
often misleading when read out of their context. The better news
papers of today 7 i.e. The New York Times, The Washington Post
and The Christian Science Monitor — all make extensive use of
analysis and interpretation of news.

The student press must also raise relevant issues and assume
a “watchdog" stance toward other segments of the college com-
munity. The paper is one of the few voices of student opinion in
a college like Grinnell where students have only very limited
power. One way The Reporter attempts to raise issuses is by making
space available for student, faculty and, hopefully, administration
views on various significant topics confronting the college. We
normally print all serious letters to the editor. Our coverage, edi-
torials, and “letters to the editor” concerning “Spring Riot” have
materially helped to bring certain aspects of campus life out in
the open so they can be meaningfully discussed. Social rules, aca-
demic regulations and curriculum; the basic questions of what are
we doing with our education here, and why, are of great concern
to us. No, we don‘t think Grinnell is perfect as it stands now, but
we are trying to help it improve by stimulating discussion and
controversy.

But we don’t think campus issues should totally consume
student interest either; bringing news and opinions from other
campuses and student concerns is specially important in an isolat-
ed community like Grinnell College. The student newspaper has
unique resources and unique access to exploration of “the college
scene” and national issues of student concern. Whenever possible
We believe we must try to relate directly to Grinnell the crucial
issues confronting the U.S. and the world today.

To the Editor:

In the light of widespread student
dissatisfaction with last week's Cirill‘
ncll Reporter, we, as members of the
Counnil of [louse Presidents, would
like to indicate some shortcomings of
the issue, and to suggest possible ave
nues for improvement.

In its posiu'pn as an official college
publication The Reporter should recog-
nize and assume a responsibilty for ac-
curate presentation of facts wiihin the
context of a virtually unrestricted —
and indispensable — press freedom,
Since The Reporter has the power to
influence attitudes and action of memr
hers of the college community, its staff
should recognize an obligation to use
this power constructively in promoting
rational discussion oi college issues.

Sensationalism, as evidenced by the
coverage of this year’s “Spring Riot
Night," is hardly conducive to ration-
.l discussion. Such extensive editorial»
izing within news articles themselves
contributes in no way to “objective”
reporting and only hampers productive
debate by clouding the issues and en-
couraging overly emotional reactions
and arguments.

Overemphasis on the lack of selfrre~
straint and individual responsibility in
this incident communicates the impres<
sion 7 and, we feel, ii is an erroneous
ans 7 that our student body is unable
to regulate its affairs and conduct. We
suggest that in many such cases of re-
porting there is involved a distortion
of the magnitude of the situation which
encourages damaging and incorrect im-
pressions of actual situations.

We feel that there is definite merit
in the philosophy that a school news
paper might lead, rallier than merely
reﬂect, student opinion. At the same
nme, we feel that editorial commentary
should be expressed in a refined and
appropriate manner, and that the first
responsibility of any leader of opinion
is to present all sides and facts of any
issue with objectivity and taste.

A second area of possible gcpual
improvement concerns the actual con<

tent at The Reporter. We recognize and
appreciate the value of dealing with
such topics oi student interest as the
Vietnam war, protest nciiviibes, and lhe
character and problems of other college
campuses. However, it is our opinion
that in allocating space and emphasis
to the coverage oi these external issue:
and events, The Reporter has some-
times failed to maintain an adequate
and balanced coverage of local affairs
and areas of more directly Grinnell
oriented student concern.

Although these aforementioned sub-
jeots may be of worthwhile interest
and thus rate inclusion in The Reporter,
we think that Grinnell news and col-
legerrelated feature stories deserve
more attention and depth than have
been accorded them in recent issues or
The Reporter, Possible stories about the
radio station, the soccer team, and an
announcement by Dean Winters were
neglected in the last issue; moreover,
student opinion might well have been
solicited on signiiicani matters at hand:
e. , Spring Riot Night, extensions of
op n dorms privileges, the reactions to
elimination of women’s hours, etc.

We do not favor any form of news-
paper censorship and we realize that n
great deal of lime and genuine effort is
put into each issue of The Reporter.
We have found regrettable, however, a
lack at certain overseeing judgment
necessary lo the best determination of
story priorities and to the general ic-
porting of evens and issues. We would
very much like to see these suggestions
considered and realized in the form of
a more respected Grinnell Reporter.

Press inlern's beat in Des Moines

By Jonathan Shows

Covering the towel State Capitol as
a reporting intern for United Press
International (UPI) was strictly an
"Alice in Wonderland" experience. It
was entertaining. frightening, and even
interesting at times.

The day starts when you try to get
past the little old man in the parking
lot. He's determined to park you off
somewhere with the “general public,"
whatever that is. And you just about
have to run the old dear over to sneak
into the convenient spots reserved for
newsmen.

Then you wind your way up to the
press gallery. There the reporters, hung-
over but enthusiastic, are busily try-
ing to stir up some news. After all,
you've got to have something before that
10 a.m. deadline. If all else fails, you
can ask some nut about daylight sav-
ings time. ”ﬂiere': always a little old
lady around who will insist that it's
a Communist plot, or it's going to burn
her lawn.

You’ve got to hustle down to the
Governor's news conference shortly
thereafter, It‘s a cat and mouse game
that no one should miss. The Governor
tries his best to keep the reporters in
the dark. of course, sometimes he'll
speak “oil-ﬂierecoi'd" and toss out
some tidbit that has been common
knowledge for a month. And the re

porters? Well, they try to get a juicy
(hopefully profane) quotation—the sub-
ject doesn’t matter much.

After that there’s the interview with
the chief of the Pottawattamie County
Temperance Union; a cup of coffee:
a call from the downtown bureau ask<
lng what the hell you've been doing
all morning; another cup of coffee; and
then you decide you'd better do a story
or your vast following will fall to see
your name in print in tomorrow’s papers.

So you glance at-a Legislator, who
then dashes madly over, anxious to
divulge anything which may get his
name in print. You pretend to he busily
taking notes as he spews forth every
thing he knows about anything. This
usually takes a few minutes. when he
tinally runs out of breath, you ask
him to, please, call someone a dirty
name, endorse the Pill, nr predict some-
thing about the war in Vietnam. A
bored smile will usually cause him
such frustration that he’ll say some-
thing controversial. Even if it's just
another comment about what s.o.b.'s
journalists are.

All too soon you’ve got to race back
to Grinnell. Just enough time to grab
a Winky-burger on the way out of
town. But you have a moment to re-
liect. And usually I think about what
a strange breed of cat is lowa gow
emment, and how beautifully appropri-
ate is its press coverage,

Fran/r assault case continues;
Des Moines poll e comment

iiy John Milne

Both the Iowa Civil Liberties Union
and the Des Moines ChieictrPolice
commented during the past week on
the alleged assault of Lawrence Frank,
in Grinnell freshman.

Frank claims he was struck in the
lace during the Des Moines peace
march, April 15. He also claims two
policemen ignored him when he pressed
charges and that an auxiliary police-
man spirited the a a s a i l a n t away
to somewhere besides the police station.

The governing board of the ICU],
according to former member, Grimeil
professor C. Edwin Gilmour (political
science), is examining evidence in the
case, The governing board will decide
shortly whether to support Frank In
legally pursuing the case.

Glimour also said he had been em-
powered to dralt a statement which. if
approved by the Hill}, would be sent
to the Polk County attorney and Des
Moines Chielol-Poiico protesting the in~
action of two policemen and the no-
tlons of an auxiliary policeman in tho
alleged assault.

Des Moines police chief Vear V. Doug-
las replied this week to the charges
made by Frank in last week's Reporter.

 

LeMoyne students protest
Memphis police brutality

Protesting what they termed uncheck-
ed police brutality, zoo LeMoyne C014
loge students and 5 Grinneil exchange
students marched on the Memphis City
Hall earlier this month.

The April 3 march resulted from
the dismissal of charges against two
city policemen who had reportedly beat-
all 21 year old LeMoyne student Clint-
Dtl Jamerson during an earlier incident.

Jamerson was lighting a cigarette
when a police officer walked toward
him. According to Jamerson. the po-
liceman expected his cigarette to be
lighted also. When the student blew the
match out, the policeman~with the aid
of another officer—took him to a squad
uar where they allegedly beat him.

One of the officers involved claimed
that Jamerson made a motion as if
m strike him but missed. The day
liter the march, April 4, charges of
disorderly conduct and resisting arrest
Igainst the Lemoyne student were dis-
miss-ed.

“We feel that it is incumbent upon
the City Commission to take immediat‘
lotion towards the emotion of an in-
dependent citizens' review board," come
mented Dr. Vasco Smith, Vice-Chairman
of the Memphis NAACP. ”The Commis<
llun must provide lawAabiding citizens
of this community with the protection
they need from our police department."

“A police department investigating
complaints against itself," added Smith,
"is like a big brother investigating his
little brother. They come out clean
ovary time.”

think separation from the community
is an adequate answer to this problem."

Charles Connerly, a Cowles Hall

and cowardly punishment because it
eliminates a person from society. in
this respect it is analogous to capital
punishment.” ,

Dr. Ninian Smart, who presented the
annual Gntw lectures two weeks ago.
Again this week I searched the paper
in vain ior such a review. it the college
thinks enough oi a scholar to pay him
to cross the ocean to present his ideas,
should the callow editors oi a school
paper ignore such an event? Or could
it he they didn't ieel equal to the task?

I suggest that the editorial staff
take A look Within at their own deficien-
cies, rather than givc the impression
of dissatisfaction with practically all
elements of Grinnell Illa: which im-
pression I tear they are giving to
friends and alumni of Gr'innell: "dam-
aging its image," in current parlance.

To the Editori

Now 'you’ve printed two naughty
words. The Board oi Publications didn’t
wash your typewriters out with soap
and the Post oiiice hasn’t revoked your
mailing privileges. i am, however,
deeply disappointed that you’ve been
satisﬁed with only two. Such an ad-
vancement certainly should have merit-
ed a larger editorial rather than the
mere inch or two it received.

aged to contain yourselves in 12 page.

worthiness oi the topics. I’ve cancelled

newspaper has always been the editor.

disenchantment with the rtegister which
contains only one editorial page, My
growing aiiinity tor the Reporter can
be viewed as a reaction against the
traditional separation between objec-
tive newSareporting and editorial opin-
ion or news analysis. The Reporter is
unique in that you have achieved a
synthesis which emphasizes the latter
much to my gr ' 'cation.

I especially enjoy the digs on the ad-
ministration. but innuendoes and dour

such space concession would prove suit.
ably coniined, such a column might
tend to obscure administration policy
to an even greater extent.

Unquestionably. last week’s outstand~
ing reature was the deliciously explicit
letter irom Miss Lemmons and Mr.
Dillon. For those oi us unable to at.
tend, they meticulously, it not tedious»
ly, described the tense and thrilling
events ,which precipitated 'ntesday’a

strong believer in due process nor
in its accompanying superstructure,

that these details were printed‘before
the case was heard, 1 really needn't
add that this might have intluenced the
Court, but let’s overlook that triviaiity
and concentrate on the iundaincntal is-
sues such as the validity of sensational

In addition to relishing inanities and
prejudices, I‘m also very sympathetic
to the philosophy oi cultist journalism,
but only tor us elite. How naive oi Mr.

To the Editor:

After reading this week's Reporter,
I became thoroughly disgusted with
the way certain things were handled by
this rug! I am referring to Spring Riot
and Professor Magee's letter.

As the good professor noted, your
paper has been leaning toward worldly
and national news rather than what’-
going on around campus, Instead of
wasting space reporting on the New
York peace demonstration and you
could have given equal space to So
Francisco, it might have been nice i
someone wrote an objective story about
the riot and Spring Day. By not doing
this, you gave an unfair representation
of the happening; by showing iu-t
a iew pictures and allowing coverage
in your letter page of one unfortunate
incident, you showed but one side of it
dualafaced incident.

I now return to Professor Magoo,
You judge his letter as a non-con-
stiuctive outburst," yet, in my opinion,
he did not just Sly that the Reporter
is becoming a lousy paper tor its in-
tended purpose, but told you why he
lelt so. and what he felt your content
should be. i wish to remind you that it
we want to know about peace demon-
strations, and other offrcanlpus goings-
on we can read the Register or listen to
To . or radio news broadcasts.

ltiy iinal statement brings together
both of the above-menﬁoned gripes. I
feel that as long as you are going in
make nonconstructive criticism oi the
riot. you should be the t ones to no-
clue anybody else’s cl'i cism of your
paper or anything else as being nonT
constructive, This is the old case or
the pot calling the kettle black. I \vrota
this letter because I sort of like your
paper, you know; it isn't all bad, just
most of it!

hek S. Piermout
hope you accept my construe-

To the Editor:

Really, Mr, Magee, Wasn’t it in your
Intro to Political Science class last
year that I learned about weltanschau-
ring? i wish to commend the staii or
the Reporter for raising college jour—
nalism above the level of a high heel
tabloid whose lead story is a straight
news article on a required, allaichaol
assembly.

the group. Mary Malcolm repeated the
view she had expressed in a Reporter
editorial: that the problem lies not in
the “Riot” itself, but in the social
setup or the campus »

Roger Koenker, SGA treasurer, moved
on behalf of the ﬁnance committee that
one of the statements of purpose {or
the initiative fund now indicating tho
promotion or interaction among halls,
be broadened to encourage “unique-
ness and creativity." Koenker noted
that several halls have been denied
initiative lurid support lor extremely
original ideas simply because their
projects were sponsored by only one
hall. His motion carried,

The original purpose or the initiative
fund, as stated at the meeting, was
to encourage halls to plan events to-
gether or with the iaculty and other
college groups. It could also be granted
to activities which involved no one
speciiic hall. Until now. the sponsoring
or an event by a single hall was a
significant factor in determining whether
the request received an initiative grant.

Turning to a discussion of The Crime“
Reporter, the principal issues were
whether the senate has any business
with the Reporter at all, whether the
Reporter should give extensive cover-
age tn bitchmpus events, and if so.
whether reporters Should be reimbursed
out ol the paper’s tunds lot this type
ol coverage.

John Herr announced that Gates Hall
is unanimously opposed to Henry Wil-
helm's trip to New York to cover thl
Mobilization Against the War in Viet‘

nam. (Wilhelm is no longer I Grinnell
student.) His complaint was echoed by
Bill Fisher, who questioned the Report-
er's oil-campus coverage and expres-
sed dissatisiaction with the coverage
ol on campus events.

Editor Krys Neuman explained that
the paper has previously printed stor-
ies by other nonvstudents about off-
campus news (eg. Vietnam reports)
and that it is difficult to ﬁnd rtudents
who will leave school for. several days
because oi the academic hardships that
result.

Knenirer said that the Reporter should
be understood as an independent jour-
nal, not as the voice or all the stu-
dents. He lelt it was not the senate’r
job to consider regulating the paper.
Ric MacDowell, SGA president, had
suggested at the beginning or the meet-
ing that students dissatisfied with the
Reporter seek jobs on its staff and
try to improve it from within.

Announcements made at the meeting:

Machwell announced that he backs
the decision of the Interim Court on
the case brought by David Dillon and
Adrienne Lemmons.

Ken Clark has been appointed Gada~
bouts chairman, Naiwa Adra, chair-
man or the loreign students board.

Folkdanners to present concert

By John When

The Grinneli Foikdancers will miter
their third annual spring program tu-
night at 7 p.m. and Saturday night at
a pm. in Roberts Theatre, The com-
pany at 71 dancers will present a di-
verse program or international dances
representative or at least 14 different
countries,

Mood, style, and costume will vary
from the quiet grace of “At Va'ani" _
I slaw Israeli circle dance performed
by women — to the explosive energy
of “Mazur” — the Polish ﬁnale num-
ber: Spirited, rollicking music will set
the mood of such lively dances as
"Bruder Lustig" and “Shuddlehux” —
of Teutonic origin. On the other hand,
markedly more restrained precision will
characterize the lighter choreography or
the Scottish medley numbers.

Among the special highlights or this
ear's program will be the Castilonean

edding dance “Espunyolet,” the Phil<
lppine “Tinlkllng” danced over,
Iround, and between moving bamboo
poles — and the “Highland Fling,"
which will be accompanied by a guest
bagpiper from the University of Iowa,
The woman “Fool’s Jig” is an his-
torical English morris dance, originally
performed in conjunction with ancient
fertility celebrations in “merrie aids
England."

Scottish kilts, Austrian Iederhosen,
Groutian head scarves, Spanish castaa
nets, and Peruvian masks are among
the many distinctive costumes and
properties which will be used to enhance
both the variety and the individuality

The rollowiug lo a statement by the
interim Court explaining their deci»
sion in the case involving David Dil-
Ion, Adrienne Lemmons, and ﬁve
Cowiea null members.

The Student Interim Court, in
recommending the renewing penal-
ties, tound it impossible to consider
this case and the actions on “Spring
Riot Night" b the ﬁve male students
as an isolate incident. We found it
necessary to consider this incident in
the context or recurrent behavior over
a number or years. The court exam-
ined not only specific testimony deal-
ing with this case, but also bacic
gmund material.

It was recommended that two stu—
dents receive conduct probation which
carries a ritten notification ot snelsi
irmponsi lity to college and student
adm tnators and to parents or the
ind idudi, It is intended to be a time
or positive reevaluation of the indi-
vidual and his relation to the commu-
nity. to this case the conduct or the
individuals will be reviewed by the
court in the middle of next semester.

it was recommended that three
students (one at whom will also re

cral expulsion which carries a con-
sure by the student court concern~
ing the individual's antisocial beho—
viorr It is intended to be a social pun-
ishment hopefully with little academ<
lo repercussion. The students in this
case will arrange to take finals and
comprehensive examinations n w a y
from the community.

Expulsion was recommended for
one student because of the gravity or
this incident and because of recurrent
antisocial behavior in complete nppo<
sition to the goals and standards in-
ward which the college strives

The court reels that the community
of Grinnell cannot tolerate anti-social
behavior or a destructive and malici-
ous nature, When an individual in-
fringes upon the rights and freedom
of others through physical and psycho-
logical brutality, he should be se-
verely censured. The court sincerely
hopes that as a result or its recom-
mendation, a period or critical evaiu<
ation will ensue not only for the stu-
dents involved, but also tor the com-
munity as a whole.

There are more Grinnell men

Senior men comment
on new draft threat

By Sue Galvin

A random sampling of senior men
indicated that the Change in draft poi-
lcy, which makes graduate school no
longer a basis for deferment, has created
some serious student concern about the
future without appreciably altering any
immediate plans.

Said one senior who wished to re-
main anonymous, “1 may find myself
a political refugee in another country
because of my moral and political ctr
jections to the war." A number of other:
who have also been accepted at grad-
uate school may be forced to choose
the same recourse.

Sam Lucas is going ahead with hi:
plans for graduate school, but com-
mented, “I may be sorry in a year."

Said Steve Shendel‘, “I still plan to
enter graduate school but have also
t'nade an application to the Naval Ola
ricers Candidate School."

Bond Faulwell plans to enlist in the
army However, he said that “this is
not totally a result of the change in
the draft policy, but the change did
make me think to get my obligation
but of the way rather than having law
Ichool interrupted."

‘A‘rt Arnold's response typified the
reactions of most of the individuals
interviewed: “I am not immediately af<
fected by the change, I am going to
continue with my longtime plans of
graduate school. However, I will think
u lot more about the draft and the
various programs I could enter, and
which ones I would definitely consider
if it becomes necessary.”

A Grinnell graduate’s IBM 1401 com-

Monsoon offensive.

Lieutenant David McBlain, Chief of
Programming and Analysis at the
Army‘s Combined intelligence Center in
Saigon, uses a computer to sort and

in 1962 and returned as an instructor
of mathematics in 1964, supervises the

“With ADP," McBlain wrote in I
letter to Professor E. R. Mullins (math<
ematics), “seemingly unrelated infor-
mation gathered from captured Vietcong
reconnaissance personnel and aerial
photographs of trodden—down grass can
lead to the uncovering of communists."

“Our knowledge of the enemy is fan-
tastic and growing rapidly," said the
former math major, “and ADP is the
first intelligence unit in the history
of warfare to disseminate theatre army
tactical intelligence as far clown as
the battalion level in the field."

“Our job is to be able to retrieve
knowledge quickly in an intelligible
fashion. We can get radio requests in

Visitor on campus

Yugoslav on Economics

By Dan Bucks

Emphasizing a pragmatic and empiri-
cal approach to economic problems,
Milos Samardzija, Professor of Econom-
ics at the University of Belgrade, traced
the development of the Yugoslavian
economy for Grinneiiians during his visit
here. April 25 and 26.

Professor Samal‘dzija’s 24-hour visit to
the campus included two lectures, a
class appearance, and several informal
conversations With faculty and students

Maintaining a vigorous verbal pace
throughout his visit, Professor Samardr
zlja described how Yugoslavia has
achieved a 7.1% rate of growth of na-
tional product through the construction
of an economy that represents a com-
bination of planning techniques and man
he: relations. Through the Yugoslavian
formula that "state ownership does not
require state management,” enterprises
remain “Socially-owned" but are homes
illgiy managed by “worker’s councils"
elected by the laborers in an enterprise.

The system of specialized production
units managed by “worker's councils"
is integrated through market organiza-
tions, State intervention primarily takes
the form of control over the “endpoints"
of the production process: the supply
of raw material inputs and the demand
for the final output. Ideally, the inter-
mediate stages of production are left
to the control of the market.

The state also maintains control over
approximately 30% at new investment
funds. This investment is channeled into

basic transportation and communications
systems or into industry located in un-
derdeveloped regions of Yugoslavia.

Samardzija described the two major
stages in the evolution of the post-war
Yugoslavian economy as “deetatization”
and “de-politizationl” “De-etatization,"
which occurred in the late 40's and early
50's, was the process of abolishing state
management of enterprises and the es-
tablishment of “worker selfamanage
ment." “Depoli zation,” which has oc-
curred in the mid 60's, has consisted of
removing the Communist Party control
of the worker’s councils. Through these
processes, the political pyramid that
characterizes a Soviet style system has
been abolished in favor of a more de-
centralized system of management.

In a markedly non-ideological manner,
Samardzija frequently stressed that econ-
omic techniques must be adapted to the
historical and cultural conditions of a
country. Whether a technique was social-
ist or capitalist in nature was of less
concern to him than whether or not the
technique improved the performance of
the economic system.

Samardzija, who is currently a visiting
proiessor at Western Michigan Universi-
ty, has concentrated his teaching intelu
ests on introductory courses. For Yugo-
slavian students he has designed course
materials that combine theories of plan-
ning and of market systems to explain
the unique Yugoslavian experience. This
“best of both worlds" approach to econ-
omic thinking has been expanded in
Samardzija's book, The Economic Sys<
lem of Yugoslavia.

 

SGA Open Dorms Committee presents
questions for discussion by students, faculty

Ed. Note: The following is a state
ment by the senate committee on open
dorms.

The SGA Open Dorms Committee is
currently involved in attempts to find
rationale either for or against an ex-
pansion of legal open visitations. The
committee realizes that certain funda<
mental questions must be answered be
fore any positive recommendation can
be submitted for student and adminisr
trative action,

1. If there is presently little danger
of upprehenslon for daytime or evening
IV's, why should we bother with try-
ing to extend legal opens? What in
owning with structured hypocrisyr. ,

2. For example, is our present rules
structure the best method of providing
a measure of assistance and support
for students struggling with unresolved
sexual issues?

3. It increased open dorms lead to
at least some increase in sexual inter-
course, “emotional trauma, and preg-
nancy," how could you, as a college
administrator, justify extending opens?

4. Could a local option system of
open dorms (each hall deciding on
its opens program within prescribed
limits) fail to protect the rights of the
individuals Voting in the minority? .

5. Could such a local option system
lead to more effective in-hall enforce
ment—as with the present quiet hours
and disorderly conduct rules where
the hall sets the standard of punishr
ment when one person’s actions are
annoying to others? .

it. with a significantly expanded sys-
tem of legal opens, what types of
penalties would be appropriate for
those violating the rulesf.

7. How can an extensionsof opens be
presented positively to parents and
financial supporters?,

8r What type of general rule struc-
time can promote most effectively stu-
dent responsibility and maturity in so-
cial, as well as academic conernsr.

The members of the Opens Committee
feel that the question of extending open
dorms provides a logical focal point:
for the discussion of many current stu-
dent concerns. The discussion must of
necessity touch on the questions of pri-
vacy. student maturity and responsibil-
ity, the student’s role as a member of
a hall and of the college community,
the “formal date” emphasis of the
present social structure, rule enforce-
ment, and the general aims of a resi-
dential liberal arts college

This committee is attempting to or-
ganizo and synthesize student, faculty,
and administration opinions on these
questions into a meaningful statement
regarding the open dorm policy. ob—
jectivity and openmindedness are pri-
mary considerations in our discussions,
and if our studies recommend it, we will
suggest that opens not be extended.

As the committee hopes to have a
recommendation ready early in Septem-
ber, they hope that the above questions
will he discussed in house meetings and
in informal student-facultyrand admin<
istraticn groups and that the opinions
presented will be forwarded to mem-
bers of this committee. The question
of open dorms should be the serious
concern of all members of the college
community,

The above questions will be discussed
Monday at hall meetings and Wed-
nesday at senate. All students are urged
to participate in the discussion and at<
tend the senate meeting.
