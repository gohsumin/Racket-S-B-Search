Calling the Kennedy Admin
stration’s handling of Cuban r
latlons a “comedy of mistakes,”
Senator Barry Goldwater (Rep,
Ariz.) lashed out at current lpol~
icy Wednesday in a student press
conference.

Goldwater told a “standing
room only” audience in Rob-
erts theater that America’s “be
firm with Cuba" policy had
been “far short of what was
needed since the ﬁrst inetiec-
tive embargo on Cuba."

He further said, “I don’t think
Russia wants to ﬁght over Cuba.
lf 1 were Khrushchev, l would
not risk losing everything when
I’m winning."

THE CONFERENCE which was
modeled after Washington Presi—
dential press conferences was co.
sponsored by Sigma Delta chi
and Theta Sigma Phi, men’s and
women’s professional journalism
fraternities.

Goldwater defended “brink-
manship" as the means of keep-
ing the peace. He compared air
supremacy of the United States
—the power behind brinkman~
ship—to the English naval su-
premacy which guaranteed "a
fair degree of peace” in Europe
for two centuries.

Describing the conditions nec~
essary for disarmament, Gold-
water demanded complete inspec—
tion privileges. He thought in-
spection might he best accom—
plished by a network of spy sat.
ellites.

He called the disarmament
proposals of President Kenne-
dy “dangerous and threatening
to the national security," con—
cluding the fundamental road-

block to disarmament to he
“We just can't trust them."
Moving to domestic issues,
Goldwater outlined his policy
on the i ississippi incident. He
attacked the intervention of the
Federal Government on the
grounds of constitutionality. The
senator argued that “the 1054
Supreme Court decision on seg—

rcgation did not go far enough,"
because it did not reserve the
power of enforcement to the
Federal Government and that it
is therefore reserved to the
states by the 10th amendment.
He found the actions of Covert
nor Barnett constitutionally valid;
but morally wrong by his own
standards.

Barry Goldwater (Rep, Aria,
said Wednesday night in the po
litical lecture climaxing the Re—

Young Republicans and the Pro-
gram in Practical Political Edu-
cation.

Goldwater claimed that freer
dom versus slavery is the real
issue of our times, the 1962 elec—
tions, and all times.

THE SENATOR urged Ameri—
cans to reject materialism and
to recognizestheir spiritual tra—
dition. Goldwater said. “The
great gulf between the U.S. and
Russia is theological. For the
Communists, man is a creature
who wants his belly ﬁlled and
a thing which can he manipu—

'freedom, what for?”

The Senator argued that for
Americans, man was not a thing

, but an immortal essence. 1n the

Contrasting views of man that he'

ascribed to East and West, Gold—
water found an irrevocable para~
dox, the spiritual versus the ma—
terial. in this context, Goldwa-
ter asked. “Why not victory?”

The Senator wamed Ameri-
cans not to overlook the prin-
ciples of the founding fathers,
especially inalienable rights.
“Man has natural rights, be.

age of GorL

The dignity of man, liberty
under God, Law, and ordered

tives of the American tradition
and Western civilization,” Gold-
water said.

Cuba resolution
wired Kennedy
by Peace Group

In the light of the 'Cuban
crisis, the Grinnell Student
Peace Group met in an Emer-
gency meeting last Wednesday
evening. The group decided on
a threefold plan of action.

First, the group organized at
telegram campaign at Grinnelll
in order for students to express

on the issue. Secondly, they deal
cided to call other schools
around the country in order to
make this telegram campaign
nationwide.

Thirdly, by unanimous votet
the group approved a resolution]
to be sent to President Ken~|
nedy, in the name of the Grin—
nell Student Peace Group, as
well as major newspapers inl
this country and abroad.

The resolution reads as fol-
ln the past anxious days the

brink of war. The world looks
to President Kennedy for lead-
ership. Immediate action must
be taken to relieve world tens
Sions and remove the imminent
threat of war.

We urge the president to
Seize the initiative and official-
ly call a summit meeting. to
make good his Monday evening
offer to negotiate the Cuba
crisis.

We must be prepared to go
beyond the immediate questions
of the hoped-for negotiations,
the US. quarantine of Cuba and
the Soviet military build-up in
that country.

Discussion must be opened on
the future status of overseas}
military bases of both powers.

 

,Our government Should enter-,Alumni office will help

tain the possibility of removing
American missile bases in the
Middle East, if we are to make
our demands for the removal of
Soviet bases valid. 3

Summit conferences of the,’
past have worked but not
well enough. An infusion of,
imagination could turn a new,
Summit into a more permanent'
cure for the ills of brinkman-l
ship. We see no more favorablel
moment for avoiding futurel
brinks that at a time when the
consequences ‘of war have been
conjured up so vividly in the‘
minds of men l

Since you have asked for par-

women students, l am glad to
add mine. i not only would not
have sent my daughter to a col-
lege with no such restrictions.
but I would not care to send
my son to a school with no
“hours“ for women students.

Such sorcalled “freedom"would
he injurious not only to the inor—
als of many students but certain—
ly to their health and scholastic
records as well.

LET US HOPE that the ad—
ministration will not yield to
any student pressure in making ,
changes in rules which could
only be detrimental to the col<
lege. i am interested in the rep
utation oi the school both as a
parent and an alumnus.

Wilkinson blames HUAC for crisis;

calls for the end

Frank Wilkinson, a leader of
a campaign to abolish the
House Lin-American Activities
Committee, spoke Tuesday at a
cotiee hour sponsored jointly by
the National Student Associa-
tion, the program in Practical
Political Education, Young Re-
publicans and the Young Demo—
crats.

Wilkinson, a strong advocate
of civil liberties, stated that the
purposes and actions of the
HUAC were directly opposed to
the principles of the First
Amendment. This is the fundav
mental issue of the abolition
campaign.

Every idea, especially a dis.
senting one, has a right to be
heard, emphasized Wilkinson.
Only subversive acts should be
punished

WILKINSON STATED t h a t
the present world situation, par-
ticularly the Cuban crisis, was
caused by a stifling of diver»
gent ideas and opinions. He
branded the HUAC as an organ
tor suppressing this dissent.

Wilkinson gave a brief history
of the HUAC which included its
becoming a permanent commr

tee of the House of Representa—
tives in 1945. The rirst major
opposition to the HUAC came
14 years later from James Roos-
evelt in a speech in Congress
and a petition to abolish the
HUAC signed by 1300 people.

Great en ism and opposie

its behavior became more
widely known thrnugh the

Opposition has continued to
increase and Wilkinson express-
ed the hope that, if his cam~
paign continues successfully,
when Congress convenes on
Jan. :3, the representatives of

the people will stand up for
their Convictions. a n d the
HUAC will be dissolved.

WILKINSON ALso recom—
mended the reading of critic-

internal Security Act. He con»
siders these the grossest invas-

American history. He asserted

Wilkinson appealed for bipar—

of his campaign. He remarked
that he appreciated being the

Wilkinson appeared betore the

break open the game in the sec-
ond half and go on to win. 22.0.
The game, played at Beloit last
Saturday, was held on a ﬁeld
muddy from Friday night and
Saturday morning rain.

In the ﬁrst half Grinnell’s
powerful rushing offense bogged
down in the mud and was Con-
tained by a Beloit defensive line

considered by many to be the ,

toughest in the conference. The
Pioneers could manage only one

ﬁrst down and could press only-

to the Beloit 45 during the en-
tire first half.

The Grinnell defense was
hardly less ferocious than Be-

loit’s, allowing the Bqu’ offense".

only four ﬁrst downs and no se-
rious threats on the Grinnell
goal.

toI

THE EARLY part of the third ‘ ,

quarter saw no change in the
outlook of the game, but with
about seven minutes left in this
period, a strong rush put on the
Beloit punter caused a fourth—
down punt to go out on the
Rue 35.

This ﬁred up the Pioneers
and they covered the distance
to the goal in only seven
plays, with Elston Bowers go.
ing over from the 1-yard line.
Bowers ran across for the two-
point conversion.

In the ﬁrst series of clowns
following the ensuing kickorf.
Grinnell’s Craig McManus pounc—
ed on a fumble on the Beloit 20.
It took only two plays from
there, with Steve Howell making
a diving 11—yard touchdown
grab of an Art Peterson pass.
Dave Gauger converted.

The Pioneers retained their
momentum into the fourth
quarter, and early in that peri—
od a Beloit punt was partially
blocked and went out of hounds
on the Buc 20. One play, a pass
from Art Peterson to Bowers,
put the game safely in Grin—
nell hands, and reserves played

much of the rest of the way,
Beloit was unable to gain a
first down during the entire
2nd half. '

IN INDIVIDUAL rushing the
threelleaders were Elston Bow-
ers, who gained 41 yards on 14
.carries, Joel Goldman, who
gained 34 yards on 12 carries
and Carlton Peterson, who gain-
ed 22 yards on 3 carries.

Art Peterson headed the pass~

Saturday the kickers edged
Carleton 3—2 and on Monday

win.

Vince Anku kicked in the
first two tallies for Grinnell,
and Frank Chilingulo scored
the winning goal in a tense fin-

Ience football battle tomorrow.
IThe Pioneers, on the heels of a
lstrong showing last Saturday at
iBeloit, will attempt to mar the
ICzlrls’ Parents Day festivities.

I Describing Carleton as a “good

passing team.” Grinnell's coach.
Edd Bowers, said, “We’re in
«,good shape for the game with
the exception of Jim McKlveen,"
who is currently hobbled by\a
leg injury, Bowers added that
if his squad doesn’t get “too
worked up” over the Carleton
contest. Grinnell could continue
on its unbeaten path.

For Crinnell on defense Bonn
lers plans to start Bob Chubrich
land Craig McManus at the ends;
Arlen Danne and Dennis Asby
or Dennis Homerin at the tack—
Iles: Steve Warrick, Gene K0»
wcrt and Pete Heinzelmann in
the linebacker slots; Kirk van
Rooyan at center; Car Smith,
Howie Dunn and Upton Ethel-
bah in the defensive backfield.
