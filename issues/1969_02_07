Nudes Protest “Body Commercialism"

'A group of ten demonstrators stripped
Wednesday in response to the appear-
hnce of a representative of Playboy
magazine on the Grinnell Campus. The
action took place at a questionranswer
uession held in Gates lounge scheduled

r 4:00. After about a ten minute dia-
ogue between Brice Draper and a few
M the 70 students and resident ad-
visors present, the group began to re-
move their clothes.

They had entered the lounge bearing
signs, and at the beginning of their dem-
onstration, a number of their clothed
aympathizers circulated notices explain-
inging their actions. The questioning
with Draper was interrupted tor only a
few minutes while the demonstrators
sang “You Gotta Walks That Lonesome
Valey." Ric Exner accompanied them
with his guitar. The demonstration was
quiet and hardly disruptive. The non<
participants remained calm with no
overt reaction though a slight nervous~
tress was perceptible. The questioning
continued as soon as the singing ended,
although the demonstrators remained
nude for another fifteen minutes.

The notice which the group circulated
explained that the demonstratng group
was objecting to the ”dehumanizing and
‘depersonalizing" attitude at the Playboy
philosophy. lt stated: “We protest Play-
boy's images of lapdog female play-

things with idealized proportions and
their junior-executive-on-therwny»up pos-
sessors." They were protesting against
the concept of women as “objects” in<
stand or humans. The questions which
followed the demonstration coming from
the demonstrators and the rest 0! the
audience indicated antagonism against;
“exploitation of sex" in the magazine
and the creation of a “philosophy" and
human ideal for proiit purposes.

Kit Leder, one or the participants, la~
ter explained that the action was in-
tended not only to dissent tram the Play-
boy philosophy but also to assert their
own human dignity.

The participant also later told or what
she called ”an undress rehearsal" be-
ing called the night before to build up
trust and courage among participants.
She also explained that during the dam
onstration she concentrated on singing
rather than her own nudity. Rather than
reeling antagonism tor Draper, the par-
ticipant telt sympathy for his having
“such an uncreative job” and {or his
being a ”cog in the Playboy philosophy,
a victim of the establishmen

in general, the strippers Seemed to
ieel that their pomt was made with ease
and naturalliess and felt no embarass-
rnent. Draper later commented that he
was not oﬂended by the nudity but he

Although Draper was not upset, Pres-

will decide it the matter should be
brought before the Judicial Council, Ex-

The Grinnell students turned out 181
people to vote on the first ballot, a su-
berb turnout compared to the 40 people
bxpected by Tom Thomas, S.G.A. pres-

:‘l'homas' prediction on the second and
tinal ballot by responding with 100

least twenty students cast votes {or non-

teasable that the two new senators could
have won the election on twenty~ona
Votes apiece.

it is certainly obvious that twentyone
votes from l,200 students is not a re-

senators In a tremendous “vote apathy’
the student body in actuallity has cast
a vote for the present “elitist" structure

Playboy Interview: Draper Confronted By 5&8

By JON STEIN

in conjunction with the continuing pro.
gram on sex education, Wednesday after-
noon Brice Draper, a representative or
playboy magazine visited the campus.
He spoke at Haines and Gates Hall to
students interested in the Playboy Philo-
sophy. The iollowing is an interview
that took place at Homes lounge.

5&3 — To begin with, I’d like to know
what department you work ior.

Playboy —— I’m involved in promotions
specifically on college campuses. I visit
approximately seventy campuses a year,
promoting products for our advertisers
and doing public relations work tor the
magazine,

5&3 —— How important is the college
student to your circulation and to what
age group do you try to appeal to?

Playboy ~ We aim our magazine at
the 18434 year old, well educated, urban
male.

5&3 — Could you tell me what ele-
ments of the magazine you consider im-
portant?

Playboy — There are no elements that
are singularly important, it is a package
of articles, reviews, interviews and pic<
wrials.

5&3 — How important is the center
ioldout?

Playboy — Not very. . .

SﬂtB — Do you have any idea of the
readers you'd lose it you discontinued
the ioldout?

Playboy — Well. . .an independent re-
search group has inlormed us that we
would lose 15% of our readers if we took
out the ioldout; alter a while, 5% would
return.

5&3 — How does that relate to your
proﬁts?

Playboy —I don't know, it depends. . .

5&3 — My point is that the playmate
is a trademark of sorts, used to sell
everything from bath towels to the Play-
boy Clubs. Your. supposed appreciation oi!

the human form is in reality common
elalism.

Playboy — We try to present the play-
mate as a well-rounded person and not
merely as a body—

siirB >— How do you view women in
general?

Playboy —— We look at the role of wo-
man as someone who is a companion, u
compliment to the mall.

5&3 — Is attractiveness important?

Playboy — Yes, sexual attractiveness
enhances the enjoyment between parF
ners.

5&3 — The human body is beautiful,
but isn’t Playboy guilty of stereotyping
beauty and exaggerating the playmale’s
accessibility?

Playboy — I thilik you're over-emphzu
sizing the importance or the told-out.
What we're trying to do is put together
a total entertainment package tor young
men, and until the time comes when

EDITORIAL:

Does Faculty Autocracy Disrupt Education?

Sixty-one students were suspended from the
University of Chicago this week for protesting a
faculty decision against the rehiring of an instruc-
tor who had “leanings to the left.” Those students
dramatically displayed their involvement with their
education and educators. They were incensed by a
faculty that was apparently more concerned with
politics than with education, The student anger
caused the first major rebellion aimed at the faculty
of an institution.

College faculties have an almost dictatorial
power in hiring and firing practices, which can de-
cisively form the character of an institution. Stu-
dents want a say in determining the character of
their education and some are willing to risk sus-
pension to combat actions undermining the quality
of knowledge they wish to gain. The student ac-
tions at Chicago are defensible for they are chal-
lenging an aspect of society, the faculty structure,
that is disrupting their education.

This incident brings to mind a certain similar
faculty decision at Grinnell. A letter appeared in
the November 15, 5&3 protesting the termination
of Sheldon Parzen. The students were deeply con-
cerned over his termination “His clarity of pre-
sentation and command of classic and contempor-
ary material combined with his unique ability to
communicate makes him a most inspiring teacher
. . . Such desire to extend himself beyond the class-
room realm has resulted in a balance of rapport
and respect rarely found between teacher and stu-
dent.” This instructor has obviously given a great
deal to his students. It seems difﬁcult to understand
what motivated the faculty to terminate this pro-
ficient educator. ‘He isn’t even a political threat.
One wonders what led the faculty to this action
,(fear)? Apparently educational concerns didn’t.

Why is this disruption to our education not
being challenged? Now that our social lives are
passified, SGA, SDS, and the average Grinnell stu-
dent seem to be suffering from a lack of concerns.
It is time for those students who are now free of
other distractions (opens, the election, etc.) to hit
what is presently happening, education. Concern
must be expressed more deeply than simply divert—
ing more time to studies as the faculty suggested
earlier this year.

This institution is no different from others and
must not remain impervious to student concern for
education (the letter to the editor did not succeed
in extending Parzen’s stay). Students must also end
their apathy toward the institution. Faculty posi-
tions are important to every student for they very
much form his education. This is one of the most
relevant issues of the day and must not be ignored.

Perhaps the SGA and SDS could get organized.

Perhaps the faculty could take some action on
behalf of the higher goals of education.

Perhaps the students could get concerned
enough to at least participate in the newly formed
Educational Policy Committees. Chicago students
were willing to be suspended attempting to deter-
mine their education. Are Grinnell students afraid
to even raise their voices? S. K.

talk of the town
By FREDRICKA NELSON

ihe talk today is mostly of the coming
spring though everyone agrees that their hopes
are quite premature. the ioreboding ice that
is all over my street and the streets of my
neighbors, ihe stm'ckeepcrs and small busi-
nessmen, is a Continual reminder that we
are in the depth of winter. it comes to us
in November or (lccember and We all long
for a white purified world. after expectancy
comes a different sense of our surroundings
as the snow becomes dirty piles and icy
puddles ol cokeeflour colored mush. we number
the days of january and febrllary as just
so many mornings oi sprinkling limo and
sand around our own places while we dream
ol the warmth and smell oi spring. [his is
the rounih winter or some, and for when,
just one in a lifetime of iowa snows. before
i came lo grinnell we had some huge bliz—
zardlng seasons with ten foot drifts and ice
on the trees almost an inch thick. we didn‘t
have school or electricity because both roads
and wires were all wintered out. for the past
few years big snows haven't been a fact and
winter has not disrupted institutions as much
as ll. might. snows are good and bad though,
since you run out of water in the summer if
you don’t get enough in winter. this winter
that's upon us came with promises of being a
hard, long, stopped—up storm season — some-
thing we wait lnr with mixed feelings de-
pending on our age. children never mind
cold at all and delight in playing castle or
fort in the grey piles of mid—winter. the first
snow this year was early and considerable —
a sufficient sign to some that this would bl
on lower winter that was.

also agree that most of Grinnell found Mr. Sea-

dicrous can he be expected to be able to ex»
plain why we do not have a lest-ban treaty?
Certainly there are better people to point Iowa
Certainly there are better people lo point

tainly, an administrator of scientists and sci-

I also doubt that Mr. Seaborg can be blamed
for his initial reaction in encountering the
Russians, “They’re just folks like us." This
naivette is a normal reaction, especially in a
country where one presidential candidate iells
us how lucky we were to be born Americans
and the other party’s vice-presidential Candb
dale makes fun of Orientals and Poles.

Walking Info Roberts and expecting a Dean

folly. All that one could reasonably expect at

actions to Mr. seaborg would have been a
shade more positive.

Cloud Looks For Silver Lining low Performance

By MARGARET MUELLER

Despite the enthusiasm of its staff and
listening audience, the executive board of
KDIC races a serious question of sur-
vival. The basis of the problem is main-
taining a well trained staff that will
carry on from year to year, achieving
excellence in both the technical and
programming aspects or broadcasting.

Station manager Al Cloud explained
that in order to attract the best people,
KDiC needs to offer something other
than ego grainlication. There should be
competition ior stair positions because or
the benefits they otter. Cloud hopes
this situation can be realized by offers
ing benefits of two kinds. The first is
monetary beneiits to the executive board
members, who spend a great deal oi
time organizmg and over-seeing opera-
tions. The second, and hopefully even
more beneficial stimulus should be the
establishment or an academic program
in communications, leading to college
credlt, as was mentioned in the Have-
iman report on curriculum change. The
KDIC board sees the possibility that
communications courses could fit into
an inter-disciplinary study such as the
present Area Studies Programs. This

The purpose of this potential addition
to the curriculum would be to train stu-
dents in the technical and educational
aspects or various terms of mass medla.

would staff the radio station and at the
same time gain valuable cxpel‘lehce

tions through an interview could also

High Ideals

By DIANE PDMERANCE

TO THE EDITOR: these opinions
do not necessarily represent those of
the KDIC editorial board, executive
board, or anybody else; but rather
those of a pissed-off student who hap-
pened to have some Contact with the
radio station and was maybe fooled
by rising expectations.

KDIC was born out of an intense dis-
like tor the way things were being run
on campus; its “goals and philosophy”
reflect that dissatisfaction: the news—
paper WAS being run by its usual clique,
student government was not success-
fully representing the needs of the com
munity, and creativity and spontaneity
on campus, then as now, seemed almost
nonexistent.

A group of students began to create

a radio station, and after three
years, 1(ch is the result. It is
questionable Whether the station is
worth the effort. The three major
goals or the original station roundcrs
were to provide better and more
music than could be heard anywhere
else, to provide an outlet Ior student
creativity and ideas, and, possibly
most! important, to provide a means
of communications that would unite
the college community (or at least
the students, it it was going to come
down to a confrontation.)

The “Special Program” slots were ln~
tended for student-originated and orient-
ed material: in—depth coverage oi cam~
pus problems, live pcriormanccs oi stu-
dent musical groups, studentraculty dis-
oussions, radio plays. Occasionally,
some solder-its are cajoled into participa-
tion, but most of these time slots are
ﬁlled by pre-tewrded musical programs
and lectures, and old Grinllell lectures.

It KDIC had these goals Tom the
beginning, why is the station contin-
uing to broadcast music for sixteen
hours each day? Why isn't the sta-
tion the paragon of communication
and creativity it once hoped to be?

Last fall there was a Certain degree

of paranoia about being put off the air
by the FCC; the Executive Board react-
ed by cutting down on disk jockey free-
dom to do and say what they wanted.
The bureaucratic problems Di adminis
tering a onehundred member organiza-
tion cut down Drl the time the Executive
Board had tor directing the station to-
ward its original goals; there were just
too many dIddIYVSIllL things to be done to
maintain a broad perspective about the
station. Personality conﬂicts Within the
stali also provided obstacles to achieving
a long-range View. As a result. the Execa
utlve Board's enthusiasm waned; staff
morale and broadcasting quality rollowed
close behind.

The first thing to do should be to
raise the quality of the station in terms
of creativity. Disk jockeys ought to be
allowed complete freedom to do what
ever kind 0! show they want: musical,
talk, discussion with students and facili-
ty, friends, townies, or any combina«
tion. Most station personnel are by now
cognizant of FCC restrictions; there is
still a great deal of latitude without
having to resort to obscenity or libel.

All students should be aware of the
present policy or allowing any student to
do a special show: anything that could
excite, or at least interest. the campus
should be welcomed. After all, it is the
Voice of the Students, not the Canadian
Broadcasting Company.

The news staff should be molded into
a strong. independent department, and
should concentrate on digging out what
is happening at Grinnell. We can’t com-
pete with Walter Cronkite, so we should-
n’ll. try. There are a lot of little known
facts about Grinnell that might lnterest
people if someone bothered to investi-
gate them. The radio obviously has the
advantage or immediate news coverage;
the ssh could iollow up with more
detailed analysis and tcature material.

Cutting the broadcasting day could
improve quaLity and morale. The disk
jockeys who ran the more creative and
stimulating shows would remain on the
air, the others would be more desirable.
and once the overall quality rose, maybe
the excitement and pride of KDIC’S iiri
few weeks on the air would return,

Applications for a new Executive
Board wul be out soon; what nap
pens to now in the next few months
depends upon ﬁnding the people with
the perspective to solve these prob.
lcnis. Otherwise, the $20,000 gloriﬁed
record player in the comer or Darby
is essentially worthless.

Return to Grinnell — Culture Shock

By LYNN ADAMS

"Henry James should have
been a Buddhist!” Grinnell is a
culturally shocking place, tull
ul people bent on making sepa-
rations; Beverly Korstad ilnds
ti strange. She has physically
come back from the Global
semester, but has not yet com-
pleted the process of mentally
returning to the Western World.

Four more Grinnellians have
also been on the Global Semes-
ter: Charlie Martin, Martha
nerkey, Kaye nandtord, and
Rama Hanson. The semester
was offered by St. Olal. and
lasted lrom August through
January. Throughout the trip
they studied religions. In Ethi-
opia there was a course in So-
ciology; in India, Economics;
in Thailand, Education; in
’apan, art.

The first day I saw her. Bev
was occasionally tonguetied be-
cause she had been speaking
Japanese; she lelt awkward
with her silverware at dinner.
A day later, she told episodes
or the past live months in Ethi-
lrpia, India. Thailand a nd
Iapan.

Guru Friend

Beverly's guru, Mahesh Nai-
Ihani, in Allahabad, India,
probably made the deepest im-
pression on her. He is twenty-
]wo, and wears his hair down
to his shoulders as a way or
sacriﬁcing good looks.

Mahesh and Beverly scan-
dahzed Allahabad by going out:
together in a bullock cart, or
on a scooter, or on a boat in
the Ganges, where Bev attrach
ed a crowd of small boats by
playing her guitar. The scandal
was that dating is not done.

Mehesh’s remarkable letters
give some idea oi what it is to
find an lndian guru.

“Beverly, you have written
that you don’t know what you
want in life, Do not let this
problem become the problem.

1 will explain you how. What
happens — one day man in his
nightmare climbs up the moun-
tom and reaches in the hilltop.
Suddenly, dawn — morning —
he wakes up — but now he can»
not do anything. He cannot go
back. Don‘t let your nightmare
(unawareness) take you too far.

“You must try and control
your primitive desire of living
in the present.”

Curriculum of Adventure

The students’ curriculum was
their explorations. Bev says one
needs Mahesh's idealism when
the dead and dying are so com-
monly to be seen. The students
round villages in Thailand en-
tirely devoted to umbrella-mama
ing, one tor lepers, one tor
weavers. in a mountain village
in Cambodia they were met by
a little boy wearing a Doubled)
Seven sweatshirt. Batman dolls
are sold at the fair. Bev the
“hog” (loreigner), didn't know
what kind of ride she was tak-
ing at that lair. They took her
through the nudie show twice.

Planes flew over Thailand on
their missions. No one could be
sure just what the American
servicemen they met were do
lng; Bev felt they were point-
edly vague.

Bey remembers foods: in
Ethiopian homes, Injura and
wat, or grey bread and meat
sauce, dipped with the lingers,

“Since we are all girls, let’s
take off our scarves."

In Thailand one does not show
the bottom of one’s foot. That
is equivalent to giving someone
the finger. In Ethiopia it is in-
decent exposure to show one'l
armpit. It is considered very
rude there to rcluse to drink
when one visits a home.

During a bus trip through
rural Ethiopia, villages of tu-
kul, mud huts with grass roots,
they met Claude, a French ex-
plorer, who was a rough Rich-
ard Burton sort, wearing ele-
phant-ear bracelets. When he
told them about the loss hi hi:

they realized that they were
really in Africa.

Among the holy men that Bev
law in India were those that;
were pails on their heads. Holy
men can roll their stomachs in
such a way as to massage all
their organs, They may clean
their stomachs by swallowing a
long strip at gauze and pulling
it out. But more important than
such curiosities is the underly-
ing idea that purity of body
creates purity of mind. The
westerners learned that they
could not imitate many of the
favored exercises of lha Asians
simply because they were not

Glick Attends Mobilization Meeting
War Goes On—Resisionce Continues

By TED GLICK

The writing of an article on
(he Mobilization In Washington
sponsored by Clergy and Laya
men Concerned About Vietnam
is like a woman paying an indil-
ferent stranger to breast leed
her child so that this mother can
particiate in some other activity.
The baby receives the nourish-
ment but does not receive the
feeling ol the love and the care
which should go along with the
reading of the child. in like man-
ner, I can write down what hap
pened in Washington, but 1 don‘t
know if I am capable, in written
lomi, oi getting across the spirit
and the leeiing which i lelt very
strongly throughout the Mobili~
zation. For this reason I am
going to simply try to give an

dependent upon the living situ-
ation ol the accused: a monk,
n pauper, a child, and one with
a feeble mind each have lesser
guilt. The system assumes de-
terminism, and Ethiopians do
not regard crime as harmful to
society. Rather it is something
to be equalized by revenge or
blood-money.

Lile imprisonment in India is
quite nice: each night and each
day count as a day, so one may
finish one's lile imprisonment
in half the time.

80% or North Thailand girls
become prostitutes; it is not
considered particularly undesir-
able there. Shack-up garages
are available for $5.00, as one
or the Global semester girls
lound out, unexpectedly. Fortu-
nately the man, a relative of
the famous King of Siam, cared
that she might report him to
the Embassy. He expected her
to act like American movie
heroines.

The impressionistic kind of
telling Bev has given me ro-
veais the semester, and the
significance oi it. which is too
global to be allrofrarpiece.

idea ol what happened in Wash-

interest you enough to come to
discuss the ideas of the Mobili-
zation Monday at 4:00 pm. in
South lounge. There I will talk-
in as much or a question and
answer and discussion-type lor-
mat as possible.

The type ot indivldual present
at the Mobilization can best but
shown by this short list of sums
of those involved: Sen. McGov-
ern, William Sloane Collin, Sen.
Hatlield, Mrs. Martin Luther
King, Marcus Raskin (organizer
of the New Party), David nan
rls (launder ol the West Coast
Resistance and one of the lirst
draft card returners), and Joan
Baez Harris. Add to these the
leaders of the American Friends
Service Comm., the Fellowship
nl Reconciliation, the Resist-
ance, National Council or
Churches, SANE, Episcopal
Peace Fellowship, not to men-
tion the top quality protessors
who were present, and perhaps
one can sense the leeling that
was generated. This feeling, a
mixture oi concern, an intense
desire for knowledge, a difﬁcult-
:odescribe leeling ol being ol
the same spirit and will, and
pervaded in every moment with
love and compassion lor the up
pressed and each other was a
most moving and effective force.

what was covered at this

Mobilization? Basically there
were three areas which was

examined: Vietnam and our

similar iorelgn policy in other
countries, the economics of the
growlng role or the military-
lndustrial - education complex,
and limit repeal, dratt Resi
lame, and amnesty tor politi-
cal prisoners and military
deserters opposed to our for
eign policy.

in as brier a form as possible,
the main taots brought lorth
these: (1) The war is not over.
The killing and the maimlng
continue. There Can be no i’e~
laxation among the members ol
the Peace movement. On a big
sign posted over the speakers
stand was this message: “You

(2) The U.S. is involved, in many
third world countries, in exactly
the same actions as those of the
early Vietnam war (in Guate-

vlsors to suppress any truly dem-
ocratic movement and we sup-

basically running the country as

SDS Where Are You?

Despite Julia and David Eisenhowers'
warning that rejection of the establish-
ment and a search for une's own values
will lead to unhappiness, (from an eyeop—
ﬁning interview with these two already-

rsying-actheremples marrieds in This

eek magazine), Grinnell’s loudest dis-
Ienting voice has decided to clear its
throat and raise its cry once again,

Two of the most important questions
lacing SDS, (part of that “small minori-
ty that gives a bad picture of the 0th
ors”). are who will be the leaders and
who will want to follow to the degree
of making posters, stuffing boxes, typing,
making lists and telephoning. Most peo-
ple are unwilling to step in and make
the sacrifices of time and energy that
leadership demands.

There is also the problem or unifica-
lionl Some SDSers are sitting back and
luvoring their radicalism, (“and not do-
ing a damned thing," says Kit Leder,
well known radical), others are sebluding
themselves with their books and high in-
tensity lamps or personal ideological
Itruggles, but some are determinedly en-
thusiastic.

A number of people believe with Bruce
Nissen that SDS will lean toward the New
Working Class theory It is concerned

with the consumer orientation of society
and the pressure from the manufacturers
and the status competition that is Torc-
lng him to consumer The revolution would
be a rejection or this style Last semester
the pro—Peking Progressive Labor Party
concept was predominant. Its emphasis
is on the bourgois Proietariat class
struggle and organizing in the factories
Nissen feels that Marxist-humanist
thought will prevail over the Marxist-
Leninist line of last semester.

"The issues will be campus centered

. but related to national problems," specu-

lated Kit Lederl The effort to get
R.O.T.C. off campus will continue. Work
tn involve students in the forming of an
admissions policy and curriculum, and
the questioning of who is controlling
their education, how, and why, will be-
gin. Mike McElfresh hopes to start a
committee on racism and work on align-
lng students with workers. He feels that
the youth culture, New Working Class
and Yippiesl are a had trend.

Probably the most significant change
in SDS will be its attempt to be more
concerned with and responsive to what
all students are thinking about and less
concerned with SDS dogmatism and revo«
lutionary rhetoric

Horton Reviews McCarthy

By RAY HORTON
Instructor in Political Science

To onlticize Senator Eugene McCarthy
during last year’s Presidential cal-n~
paign was difficult. Those who did dis-
covered that the dichotomy between Mo-
Carhhy and the very real demons against
whom he fought provided him an image
that both shielded and ennobled him.
Analysis or the man today may be
more fruitful (and neither moot nor
purely historical if his recent statement
oi “mntinued interest” in the 1972 nomi-
nation is accurate).

Part of the popular fascination with
McCarthy stems from the feeling that
he is unfathomable, lntellemuals in
America are particularly fond or this
trait in their politicians. McCarthy seems
a man shot through with paradox. He is
capable of being both eloquent and ob—
scure, homespun and arrogant, intellec-
tually committed and emotionally de.
tachedl He can speak of opening our
political institutions to the young, then
support Russell long over Ted Kennedy
for Democratic whip, He can invest him~
seli in a crusade to disengage us from
Vietnam, then turn over his influential
Foreign Relations assignment to a hawk.
He can argue for the moral and poli-
tical necessity of keeping blacks within
the system, then fall to campaign in
black neighborhoods. Throughout his re-
cent polltloal career the values and be-
havior for which many applaud him have
been followed by seemingly inexplicable
lapses. In these he seems to delight or,
at least, leave unexplained.

The argument here is not that politi-
cians can, must or should be consistent
over the long-run. In a pmfegion where
careers are long, maturation possible,
pressures and issues complex. consis»
tency may indicate only a simple mind.
Yet. it does seem important that at a

EVERYTHING MUST GO!

given time in history people be able
develop some undersmnding of the basic
beliefs and dominant behavioral patteml
of those who oiler themselves to lead
the country. Obscurantism may he dis<
tinguishable from duplicity (as an act of
passion may be different from one or
premeditation), but the end result may
be the same. Wheuier or not Johnson
lied about Vietnam during the 1964 cam-
paign seems highly immaterial now.

Poets may object to the above as an
attempt to put down the sublime and
psychiatrists as an example ai amateur
psycho-analysis. aoth may be right.
Let me develop the argument a bit dif-
ferently by shining my concern imm
what I can't rind in McCarthy to what
I think i can.

First, he strike's me as a gentleman‘s
liberal" in whom lives as much Tory as
Whig. To criticize our Vietnam policy
took more courage than liberalism — to
criticize the Democratic Party took nei-
ther — to enter the fight with black.
takes both — to support oil men and
Russell Lﬂng shows neither. A gentle
liberal he is; the right kind (in my view)
he is not.

Then there is his emotional detach-
ment, which is closely related to thl
above To paraphrase Arthur Schlesing—
er, “reason without passion is sterile."
cur system is already weighted so heav-
ily to inertia that emotion and forceful-
ness are demanded from leaders who
talk of change. 1 sense in McCarthy that
the well or emotion would too quickly
run dry.

Third, McCarthy reflects the Progres-
slve tendency to abhor power in politics.
His views on the American Presidency.
it put into action, would reverse over a
half-century of history and once more
return national power to the conservative
halls of Congress More than ever Amer-
ica needs an aggressive Pmsldent who
will seek and use power, realizing that
the availability of his political resources
is directly related to his ability to efiect
change.

Finally, there is the problem oi con-
stituency support. For whatever reasons
(and i think the above suggests some),
McCarthy has drawn support irom a
somewhat narrow and somewhat sur-
prising series of groups e the young, the
intellectuals, the White middle and up-
per classes, the suburbanites. i would
argue that among them only the young
represent a truly progressive lorcc. The
real problem, though, is less the pre-
sence of certain support groups than the
absence of others, primarily blacks. Nix-
on may piove this wrong, but the ab-
sence of black support for our national
leaders (and a reciprocal enthusrasm)
seems potentially dangerous.

Let me close with a caveat and a sum-
mation. in my opinion McCarthy should
have been Time Magazine's Man Oi the
Year, for his courage and the decisive

role he appears to have played in easing
the Vietnam Situation. For this alone ha
has won a place in history. He was, but
clumsily, the right man at the right
place at the right time. However, Ameri-
ca’s problems run deeper than Vietnam
and our party structures They call for
more than familiar liberalism and an
underlying detachment from emotion and
the quest for political power.

Vocations for
Social Change

By CATHY JONES

For those graduating Seniors or lib.
erated underclnssmen who aren't inter-
ested in graduate school, “establish
ment” jobs, or government pacilication
programs, but are interested in social
change and survival, word has come
{mm a group of those conspiratorial,
change-oriented Caliiornia freaks about
how to do it.

A Catalog called “Vocations for Social
Change,” published monthly by a group
of people living together in Canyon,
Calif nia, contains listings of work pos<
sibilities with “movement" —— type
groups of all kinds across the country.

The California group espouses no
speciﬁc philosophy of social change, but
provides descriptions of employment op
portunities with groups whose philosu<
phies cover a broad range of thought and
ideology, As stated in the catalog, “We
do not want to become the General Hers
hey at the movement for social change,
“channelling" people into positions where
we feel they might be most effective.
We are trying to convince people that
they can have an impact on changing
society while earning a living and doing

work that fits their particular skills and
temperaments."

Most organizations can pay only sub<
sistenee salaries or else expect you to
find outside work ior support. but the
Vocations for Social Change people
themselves are proof that this can be
done very successfully. The catalog ot-
rers accounts of their own experiences,
bread recipes, advice on eeonomizing,
food stamp information and other impor-
tant tips on how to maximize your milli<
mal earnings and stay healthy. (“Shar-
ing Income for Change" was the title
of one article.) The return comes with
learning how to implement your own
ideas about SDClal change, with learning
new ideas, with living and cooperating
with groups of people and other impor-
tant rewards to the spirit.

Specific job opportunities range from
teaching in lree form elementary schools,
to livmg and working on a communal
farm, to counselling runaways, or setting
up and printing movement papers. For
example, Liberty House (Poor People’s
Corporation) in Jackson, Miss,, “estab-
lished to provide jobs through hand-craft
cooperatives for poor people in Missis—
Sippl,” needs people, publicity and sales
promotion, and a purchasing agent at
salaries of $120 (plus) per month. Twin
Oaks, 3 Walden Two type community in
Louisa. Virginia, welcomes new mem-
bers. The diversity in opportunities,

Number one St. Olaf, 11.1 in the

didwest Conlerence. Second
place Carleton rolls into town to-
marrow While Monmouth will
visit Darby on Tuesday, closing
out a sixrgame home stand.

Tom Lower will probably re

earlier in the season, Bowers in-
dicated. The senior forward
Came off the bench to ram in
22 points against Florida Pres-
byterian.

Terry Holloway’s 44 points
gave him 189 in 12 games [or a
15.3 average. Scott l-lonson, who
was right hchlltd with 43 week-
end tllllles, boosts a 14.5 average
on 163 markers in ll aulillgs.
Henry Wingate IS also hitting in
double figures With a 10.7 aver
age for 12 games.

In early season road games,
the Pioneers lost all Monmouth

76‘66.

Under-Rated Profs
Make ll’t‘l Title Bill

The Professors ran their IM
mark to 31 as they hlitzed
Haines Sunday night, winning
the ”A” game 48731 and the
“B" contest 4217. The hapless
Haines defenders played vali<
antly, but they were clearly
outmanned.

The Profs jubilant coach,
Terry Parssinen, flushed with
victory, entertained the team at
the Longhorn arm the game.
Parssinen seemed somewhat
bothered by the “A" team’s
sloppy play, but praised the
“B" squad eirusively. He also
threatened some player
changes it the “A" squad does
not “shape up." “Winners never
quit," Parsslnen Said, "and
quitters never win."

Attendance was again sparse,
though it was better. The Profs,
disregarded by the experts in
the pre-season pollsI now look
like they may he a contender
for the title.

large increase in the number of men
who refuse to register or who turn in
their draft Cards. (5) There were repeats
ed calls for an amnesty for all those who
have turned in their draft cards and
gone to prison, all those in the armed
forces who have refused to fight and.
have gone to military prisons, and all
those who have deserted to Sweden ra-
ther than remain in the armed forces.

Action? Two things were done
which I guess could be called action.
One afternoon We all ambuloted over
to the plush and heauu'rul Senate
and House offices and spoke to our

respective Congressman. personally
i was, not surprisingly, frustrated.
i saw Sen. Miller and my “Repre.
sentative” from the district in New
York state in which I live. and both

were equally ignorant of conditions
in the developing nations and ap-
parently unwilling to think over any
opposite views. However others did
have some success, and those peo-
ple who visited Sen. Hughes were
very impressed with his seemingly
sincere compassion and understand
lug. Overall I would say there was
some effect, but my cynical nature
toward Congress as a whole forces
me to add “very little and very tem<
porarily."

The other action, which I felt to be
more important and personally rewards
ing, was a march to the Justice depart
ment steps, led by Mrs. King and Mr.
Cottin, at which place Mrs. King spoke.
it was a moving and inspiring service,
but I have no idea what effect it had
on the government minds. Perhaps it
this action helped to give the people the
strength to work at the revolution upon
returning home, then it was a success.

Cecil Taylor Previewed

Uncompromising Arlisl Presents New Jazz

By GARY GIDDENS

Cecil Taylor, pianist, composer, poet,
and allramund musical guru tor the jazz
advance guard, will he on campus Feb-
ruary 6, 7, 8. Leonard Feather has writ<
ten of him, “The lreedom, complexity,
harmonic innovation and emotional bril-
liance of Taylor’s playing have estab-
lished him as one of the truly original
minds in American music . . Taylor‘s
fast and intricately structure lines, al-
most percussive in their intensity, have
had a stirring effect on the new horn
techniques of the 60's . . A lack of ac-
ceptance by some musicians and critics
and pitifully infrequent opportunities to
record, have kept Taylor‘s reputation and
following limited to a small but devoted
group of admirers"

That's not the half of it, Taylor has
been screwed royally by club owners
who were more interested in selling
drinks then providing a free rein for ar<
tlstic expression, Record companies have
used him for a tax loss and don’t both-
er to distribute. in this, Taylor Is not
unique. 0n the contrary, there are very
few—jazz musicians who have not suf-
iered under a similar strain of capita-
lism. The new jazz is the bastard child
of American music: it can't make it
on a popular music level and it is not
accepted by the classical elitists. Taylor,
however, is an uncompromising artist
who puts his craft first and refuses to
kiss the asses of the money grabbing
critics and hucksters who control the
(gasp) “muslc business." Unfortunately,
the payoff at times was one major gig
a year supplemented by working at
Macy‘s ln the afternoons

And now‘twelve years after his first
major date in New York — the critics and
the public who criticized him as being a
charlatan and anti-jazz are coming
around Cecil Taylor is a virtuoso planist
who unlike many of his imitators—some
of whom are better known than he—can
express on the keys what‘s happening in
his head. And that's what jazz is about
—expresslon and communication. This

doesn't mean that he is any more ac»
cepted by the public. Last August, he
despalred as to whether he would ever
record again. Those who have heard him,
know that if ln a hundred years some
historian asks whether people in the
20th century could communicate, Cecil
and some other musician like him will
serve as one at the new affirmative ans-
wars.

Previously our ideas of time and space
have been negated in favor of a collec<
tlve sound emanating from individual
musicians surrendering their individual-
ity to a group feeling This music is not
intended for background music; it is a
total music.

During their stay here, the Cecil Tay-
lor Unit Will be available to the entire
campus for discussion, etc, Thursday at
4:00 p.m. there will be a lecture-discuss
slon. Friday at 8:00 pm. there will be a
drum workshop and at 10:30 pm. a
poetry reading by Taylor, All of these
events will be in the South Lounge. The
concert is in Roberts, Saturday nlght at
8:00 p.m.

Open up your mind and give them some
of your time. They're worth listening to.
