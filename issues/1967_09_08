INTERVIEW
WITH HAGKES

By GERALD SWANSON

An NBC. Television space
specialist had more to say on
politics, prepping and persua-
sion than on the space program
during his visit to the Grinnell
campus Monday.

Peter Heckes, a former Read
prep and Grinnell graduate
gave his predictions for the
1963 presidential elections in all
interview with the see.

‘It the elections were held
tomorrow Lyndon J o h n s o it
would probably win only be-
cause nobody else would have
time to campaign against him.
Johnson is definitely in tl‘oubIE.
mainly because at the Vietnam
war, which has trapped him in-
to a situation in which there
is nothing he can really do."

The from running candidate
at this time, according to Mr.
Hackes, is Richard Nixon, who
“seems to have the most et‘»
iicient organization.”

Hackes discounted R o ii a I d
Reagan as a possible nominee
because of “his problems with-
in the party” and eliminated
George Romney because “he's
a little on the corny side.
Romney also would be troubled
by his affiliation with the L.D.S.
(Mormon) Church, which has
not yet taken a stand on civil
rights."

MAGAZINE '
T0 REPLACE
ALUMNI S&B

By MOLLY MCGUIRE

The traditional Alumni
Scarlet and Black will be re-
placed by a new publication
Called The Grinnell Magazine.
Unlike the old newspaper, a
iour~page publication put out
six times a year, the magazine
will be a quarterly of at least
twenty - eight pages. The new
publication is being edited by
Dean of Men, S. Eugene
Thompson, who worked on the
Scarlet and Black when he was
a student at Grinnell.

When asked about the reason
for the change, Thompson ex.
plained that there had been
strong iaculty interest in a
magazine of this type, In a
magazine format, rather than
that of a newspaper, more em-
pliasis can be given to the ln<
tellectual side of the college,
not just the current news.

In addition to the regulara.
Iumni notes and news briefs
about the college, Thompson

hopes to include longer atti-’

cles dealing with the college,
and also student work. “We
definitely want students to
work on the magazine. The
only real criteria that covers
all instances is that the stuff
be of general interest. I will
be glad to see anything anyone
has oi interest to the maga-
zine." Many colleges, Thomp-
son pointed out, put out Alumni
magazines so interesting that
even people not involved in the
college enjoy reading them. H
would like to See Grillnell’s be-
come one of these.

Dean Thompson does not see
The Grinnell Magazine as a
iund~raising vehicle; merely as
a promotion to those people al-
ready interested.

“Prepping now is nothing

“This prepping integrated tlte

Grinnell students, long used
to their teet as the only means
or transportation. may soon
have a second choice.

Three Grinnell students, Deb-
by Friedman, Molly Malcolm,
and Don Stump, hope to make
tree bicycles available to Grin-
nellians. The plan developed by
the three students involves a
donation ot twenty-iive cents
from at least a thousand people.
Aside iiom iinancing the plan
by student donation, another
important means of getting
money will be subscriptions to
the Dave Gibson Memorial
Monthly Magazine.

With a minimum of 5250, they
hope to buy fifteen to twenty
bikes.

According to the plan, the
bikes will circulate freely about
the campus. A bike may be
picked up by a student anyv

where on campus, then dropped
when he reaches his destina-
tion. The bikes may also be
taken off campus, but the stu-
dent will be on his honor to
return the bike to campus.

The bikes will be identiﬁable
by some sort of unique design
or odd color,

The organizers of this idea
have talked to representatives
of the Schwinn Bicycle Com-
pany, and hope to get a good
deal on the bicycles.

North Campus students who
have been and will be collect-

The Jasper-Poweshkk County
Mental Health Center opened
in Grinnell Sept. 5 with offices
in the Community Hospital.
This represents an expansion
of the services of the Jasper
County clinic. Previously, psyo
chiatric counseling tor student!
necessitated traveling to New-
ton. Now, most of the sessions
can be conducted in Grinnell.

The Grinnell office is staffed
by a full-time clinical psychol-
ogist, Dr. John Dani a tull-
time secretary-recep ist; a
partrtlme social worker, carol
Pollock; and part-time doctors
Berryllill (psychiatrist) and
Demorest (psychologist).

The center continues its cons
tract with the college by which
the college pays tor the iirst
six interviews with a student.
However, most student prob-
lems should be handled by
campus counselors and initially
students should go to the resi-
dent advisors, counselors, or
deans who may then rater them
to the center. However, the
ieeling that there exists a hut-
Iine between doctors and deans.
which has bothered students in
the past, may be lessened.

In an interview this week, Dl‘o
Daniel assured tlle 5&3, “Everys
thing the student says here re-
mains contidential. If there is
a problem which we feel should
be discussed with college
personnel, we have to get a
written release of information
from the student."

MAKING YOUR SCENE

in his remarks at Convocation Monday, Peter Hackes spoke
of the technological growth that has occurred since his undergrad-
uate days, and predicted the trend of further growth to the year
1000. None of us would deny the great changes that science has
made in our world, nor fhe importance of continued scientific en-
deavors.

it was unfortunate, however, that Mr. Hackes digressed from
his catalog of the good things in life to comment on “the gang
that turns itself on.” He is as sure that his world of technology
is the scene to make as he is afraid the hippies believe theirs’
is the only way.

We are certainly not reassured about room for spiritual and
social growth in the world when the hippies are described as
working for love only by “lying back on (their) long hair and
dreaming," and when earning a degree from Grinnell helps
guarantee its owner “a placid life and a sensational career.”

We hope that Mr. Hacites does not believe that all hippies
are lazy because they don’t want to work hard to earn a placid
life. Their effons in many other directions point up their willing-
ness to work. Each person has his own indiVldual scene to make,
and if he denies it, he denies his individuality.

Technological growth is a man-made blessing of our age, but
spiritual and SOCIal growth must also Come from men. The lalter
must accompany the former if We are to ﬁnd any satisfaction in
our scientific paradise.

THE GRINNELL MAGAZlNE

We are pleased to hear about Dean Thompson’s new Grinnell
Magazine. The plan to enlarge the size and expand the content of
the old Alumni Scarlet 8r Black is well thought out.

Through this new medium, Grinnell alumni and friends will be
able to see the best in news, creative writing and photography
from the campus. Their enjoyment will not be disturbed by irre-
sponsible editors, or crank writers, or other detractors from the
true Grinnell picture. And of course, the magazine will continue
to publish true stories about the college while Student publications
wallow in evil, deceit, and corruption

Grinnell students will surely Want to see What their college il
really like, and the magazine should oblige them

One suggestion: Why not include favorite campus jokes, vo—
cabulary tests, first person stories ot heroism and arlicles by
conservative alumni and call it Grinneliians’ Digest,

THE LONELINESS OF THE
IONG DTSTANT STllDENT

Paul Jones

One of tile most prevalent attitudes or philosophies among
creative people at Grinnell is that which I chose to call ‘alones
ness’. This is not the same as trying to be an individual, or 'lden—
tity crises’, or apathy, or any of the other longtime maladies with‘
which Grinnell Supposedly has been plagued But, on the other
hand, it is perhaps the basis or one of the prime bases of some of
these nominal problems.

This is not to deny that there are virtues to being alone with
yourself and indulging in introspection at times, but carried to
extremes, as in anything, it becomes an evil which by far oute
weighs its virtues. To hear people complain about having no-ono
to 'talk to’, to hear them say that there is nothing to do here, is
one indication of this. But a much greater and more important
indication is the pretty much total unwillingness of many people
— students and faculty alike —— to express what they as individu-
als feel or Lhink. There are plenty of ‘sincere’ people on this
campus, but it is hard to prove this by public example.

I for one elm convinced that there are a majority of people
at Grinnell who have deep and important feelings to recognize
and, if ever expressed, thoughts that would probably approach
the limils of proiundity.

Why, then, is this the case? Is it because there is not a will~
ingness to express? I don’t think that this is the case at all. It is
more a fear- to express. There is the fear to allow yourself to be
placed in a position to be criticize ‘ mean criticized in the sense
of judged or measured, not or zed in the sense of being
walkedon. To fear being walked-on is a legitimate fear, but un-
fortunately one engendered by the former sense of ‘tn be criti-
cized'. That is, most of the ‘judgment’ that takes place is a do
structive type that forces most people to conclude that to be
placed in tiny position of criticism, outside of the classroom, iii
dangerous and to be feared.

What does ail of this have to do wilh ‘aloneness’ that I men-
tioned before? Perhaps this attitude of aloneness is only a ration.
alizallon for the fear of criticism or judgment, and the unfortu-
nate result is that creativity becomes a private affair.

When this happens, a college campus becomes a sterile and
quiet place. it is untortunate that Grinnell has assumed this
atmosphere,

A GUIDE FOR HARRIED FROSH:

HOW TO WIN PROFS
AND INFLUENCE GRADE POINTS

By DON WINNEY

As two—intellectuals. m u s r
freshmen right now are prob«
ably shaking traumatically. Afr
ter all, at an intellectual school
like Grinneil how can they im-
press anyone without embar<
assingly contcssing their medi-
ocre college board scores or ad-
mitting to everyone’s amuse
ment that they’re just not a Na-
tional Merit Scholar?

Well, let’s face it, both ad-
missions are just terribly
gauche at the Harvard of the
Midwest. But there is something
freshmen can do to Win friends,
influence profs, and escalate
gradepoints. Yes, future fellow-

ship followers, it just takes
thirty minutes for n more
powerful intellectual vocabulary
——or, as they say in intel-
lectuaiese, to verbalize the aca-
demic patois.

Now let’s take an example,
a conceptual example or course,
a typlcal sentence from a typi«
cal humanities paper written by
an atypical Grinnell freshman.
(All Grinnell students. accorda
ihg to the catalogue, are atypi-
cal although they may typical-
ly get C’s.) “King Lear,” writes
this terribly in n o c e n t fresh<
man, “is about life." Now im-
mediateiy it is obvious our
prep has made, us they say,
an egregious mistake—maybe
oven to fatunus one or, fortua
uately, maybe just a mistake.
You see, everything outside the
academic world and some
things in it, like IQ's, are
phenomena. The word phenom-
ena is a very useful one to
show that the prolessor has ob-
served something plural with a
thesaurus. To the uneducated
it’s just some iacts. Now, aca-
demically refined, we can
write, “The phenomenon of
King Lear is about life.”

But in our verbal utopia. noth-
ing ever “is." Some things
“militate towar 4" Other things
"militate against.“ But nothing
over “is." So next we must
write. “The phenomenon of
King Lear militates toward

life." But what about that word
life? Life Is an extremely am-
biguous term. filled with seem-
ing simplicity but really as
complex—as well, life It might
be confused with all kinds of
things, like the magazine. So
we need a word with more pro-
cision, a word with more ex-
pression. yes a word with more
impression. “The phenomenon
or King Lear" we write know-
ingly, “militate: toward the
human condition."

Now that’s beautiful. And It
expresses so much But, we
ask with the critical scholar’s
Eye, does it express enough?
Does it express those subtle
nuances ill thought, those sub
terranean layer: of symbolic
meaning? Unfortunately not. So
we must, as they say it
were, “explicitly explicate" the
thought. (A sentence, by the
way, ls always a complete
thought. although a thought may
not be a sentence unless, that
is, it is complete and only then
when it is Verbalized thusly ex-
cept if the sentence itself is
incomplete. See first humanities
lecture.) By explicitly explicat.
ihg, we supply more pertinent
information to the sentence
while using, naturally, the some
impressive precision in the orig-
inal thought (which is also I
complete sentence.)

“The phenomenon of King
lean," we write modestly,
“dramatically maximizing in
Elizabethan conceptualizations
the thesis theorized by William
Shakespeare, militates toward
the human conditiol '

How expressively these syl<
labies undulate; how impres-
sively they sonorously resound.
One look and the prof will
hastily write “very perceptive"
on your paper. B plus you, and
run swooning to the dictionary.
But that's not enough, He has
to be jealous; he has to faint
when he gets there. What’s
missing? Wily that suggestive
touch oi philosophy. or course,
that mystical mention of elusive
ideas.

Now I think the Vll‘ginal
freshman should be warned at
this point about introducing
orgiasiic thoughts into intel-
lectual intercourse, Favorite
philosophic terms will vary with
e u c h intellectual generation.
Several years ago, for example,
everyone. especially Huckleber-
ry Finn, was a latent homu<
sexual. Now King Lear may
very well be a latent homo-
sexual, (Please, I don't want
here in any way to make any
value judgment about the bene—
fits or costs of homosexuality
before running a costabenefit
analysis on the subject,) But it
is well to in him into a larger
cuntext,—lnto a broader frame
at reierence.—to which the pro
lessor can readily identify. (Un-
less, of course, your prof is a
latent homosexual in which case
it is best to be quite discreet).

Today the intellectual likes to

Iind existentialists, Existential-
ists are here, there, and every.
where, somewhat like the Bea-
tles, but not quite so turned on.
1n tact, most have turned nit
somewhere into a graveyard
where they wait hopefully to
be resurrected by a scholar
after—as it is. was, and were—
u desperately agonizing reap-
praisal. But don't worry. Som-
diligent scholar has already
done it, so just check the card
catalogue Then, decide what
kind of existentialist (King
Lear, for example, was written
before the term was invented).

Now ﬁnally, we are ready
tor that last lilting phrase intel~
lectuals love so much to use,
a phrase guaranteed to make
the prof scribble a quivering
A: in the final analysis. “In
the final analysis," we write
with perhaps a tinge of wena
earned humility, “the phenom-
enon oi King Lear. dramatical-
ly maximizing in Elizabethan
conceptualizations the thesis the-
orized by William Shakespeare,
militate: toward the human
condition in the historical con-
text of paleo—existerltialism."
There. Now wasn't that simple?

AN MAL BEHAVIOUR

By No“ Fischer

When the winds of liberalism came to campus last semester,
“no hours for women students" was blown. The reason? Simple
—— it may get a little cold.

imagine, if you will, a North Campus boy and a South Cams
pus girl. The time is nearing midnight on a Saturday night. Both
have tinished their sundry assignments and, let us say, they'll
just lko to go somewhero and talk.

And they can. can't they? Aitor all, the progressive Grinnell
administration and student body passed “no hours for women
students."

They can go where they want and stay out as late as they
Want, They are free individuals capable or conducting themselve.
as beiits Grinnellians. Pretty little picture?

Not quite.

Imagine it in January, It is a minus two degrees outside.
The library closed last year nightly at about 11:15 pm, Thil
year it will close at 11:15 pm

The Forum closed last year at 12:30 am. on Saturday
nights. This year it will close at 12:30 am. on Saturday nights,

Hall lounges are ott limits at 12:30 a.rn. at the very latest,
and student rooms are only legal during the little periods on Sun-
day afternoons.

Downtown bars are expensive, The Shell diner — the only
place in town that stays open all night — Is far ironi campus.
The Monroe Hotel is a little indiscreet,

i’ll tell you what: They can sit outside in the Iowa winter
until they freeze into the cold. entirely moral statuettes all good
administrators yearn lor.

Ask the administration what good “no hours ior women"
does it you don’t have any place to go. They'll tell you they’re
working on it. Oh. yes, they'll tell you. Here are some samples:

Henry Alden, head oi Burling Library: “1 have been assured
that [here will be no change in library hours this year.”

Mrs. R. A. Hawk, manager of the Forum: “1 don’t expect
any change . , t We don’t expect to be open any later this year,
and 1 haven’t had any indication from anybody that any place
will be open any later.”

Dean Winters: “I don't know, and I make no comment a!
this time. This is something that will have to be considered by
the 196168 Student Affairs Committee. . .”

The clean added that the Student Affair! Committee hasn't
scheduled a meeting. “I don't know when the first meeting will
be."

But Dean Thompson probably best elucidated the “no hour:
for women students” situation a: it stands — and i do mean
“stands":

"No one should accuse us of bad faith, because this it
something that should have been thought about harder before.

"And it you want action, you'll have to push the members or
the (Student Affairs) committee.

“We are a school that looks at the things we do from every
possible angle . . . Sometimes we look so hard we don’t take
enough action,

“if you want to tell them something, tell lhem to tell tlm
committee members to come to a meeting. Don't let just a few
come - not enough to do anything. Get them all there and tell
them what you want. Don‘t let them just pass the proposal
around for inspection a week later in a (campus mall) en-
velope, .

So, tor a starter, l’m telling you just what the deans told
me, Right rrom the horses' mouths, you might say.

Now, kiddies, get angry and tell them — Mr. Burma, Mr.
Bowers, Mr, Magee, Mr. Wall, Dean Low, Dean Thompson, Dean
Winters and Dean Stauss — that you want someplace to go late
at night,

If you don’t, ”no hours for women students" isn't worth a
tlnker’s damn, your freedom is worth nothing, and your mind!
must have been blown away by the Winds of liberal small talk.

A STUDENT OPINION

STUDENT-RATED FACULTIES

By BOB SWORTWOOD

The issue of a student-rated faculty is an important one.
Student rating is a means by which all students can cooperate
to improve the college. it allows a middle ground tor construc-
tive critiCism. New, when Grinnell students aren’t rebelling
against the Establishment, they’re ignoring it. systematically
compiled student opinions on teachers and courses might stimu-
late greater undergraduate interest in the school, and improve
the quality or a Grinneil education.

Right now there is no really good method to measure the
quality or teaching at Grinneii. A new student setting up his
schedule has only two sources irom which to judge. First, he can

look up iaculty degrees, alma maters and publication records in
various school journals, all or which tiequently mean nothing as
tar as teaching ability is concerned. Second, he can ask somebody
else. Since iaculty members understandably reiuse to evaluate
their peers in iront ot undergraduates, students usually end up
polling each other. This is potentially more successiul, because
most Older Grinnell Students have an idea of who is good or bad.
The probem is that many upperclassmen are unable to back up
their evaluations, When asked for his opinion the typical upper-
ciassmall turns rUmDi'vanger‘ concerning professors outside of
his direct contact. He cites anecdotes irom the campus grapevine
which are oiten passed around more ior their humor than their
validity. When occasionally a dose or grudge nursing or personal
bias is thrown in, the freshman is better Off knowing nothing at
Elli

The solution might already have been found at schools
such as Harvard and Berkeley. Students publish their own guides
to Courses and teachers. Publications are based on question
naires filled out contidentially during the previous semester in
each of the courses listed. The answers are then evaluated and
tabulated at Berkeley, by graduate students in the respective tle-
partments, and at Harvard by the editors oi “Tile Crimsun.” Thus,
the comments DI one or two soured students do not color a com~
posile picture,

Most important, however, is the value or such a system for
orderly student criticism. There is no reason why students may
not bring to public attention the proiessor so ill-prepared he con»
stantly brushes oli questions, the protessor who never hands back
tests or papers, or the one whu year atter year reads his lecture
notes In a mumbling monotone. Conversely, why not applaud the
good teacher and explain the nature oi his contributions?

Although student opinion is oiten held in disrepute as unthink»
ing extremism, there is in fact no reason to believe the student
cannot be a iatrminded judge. Further, when he passes rumors
outside or class he is judging. When one section oi a course over-
ilows, and another is barren. this evinces a student Judgment.
Therefore, since such evaluations are being made, why not make
explicit the reasons ior them in a student pamphlet such as Hap
vard’s “Conﬁdential Guide ID Courses?” Hopeiully, teaching at
Grinnetl might improve.

versity Service. The event is
scheduled for October 7 at 8:00

The w.U.S. was organized in

1920 to provide a program or
mutual assistance among the
universities of the world. This
program is especially active in
Asia, Africa and Latin Ameri-
ca. Their major concerns are
student health, food and lodg-
ings, educational iacilnies, and
individual and emergency aid.
An example or a wrus. prD<
ject is the University of Basuta
Bland, Bechuanaland and Swazi—
land (UBBS), the only univers-
ity level institution in South
Africa which is not subject to
apartheid,

The organization is continual-
ly raising funds to support such
activities. The Board of Relig-
ion is optimistic that many
students and campus groups
will participate in the auction
this year.

GHAIR BURNS
OUTSIDE QUAD

A discarded cigarette set fire
to a chair and endangered oth-
er items ol furniture stored be
tween James and Haines Halla
about midnight Monday.

Girls irom surrounding halls,
many wearing their niceties,
attempted to put out the small
fire, but were unsuccessful. The
city ilra department responded
to a resident advisor's call and
was able to extinguish the
“blaze" in a. matter of min-
utes,

Furniture from the entire
Quad, recently returned from
summer storage in Des Moines,
was piled along East Street, in
tho alcove between Halnes and
James Most oi the girls had
not yet picked up their items.
in the same alcove were a
number at discarded flamma-
ble packing cartons

An unidentified man walking
along the street ﬂicked a live
cigarette into the chair early in
the evening, Several girls
stamped out the resulting tire,
but it continued to smoulder
until about midnight, when a
heavy cloud of smoke ap-
peared,

Quad residents, including rear
ident advisars, battled the tire
with wastebaskets full at wat-
er. Hall ﬁre extinguishers were
ineffectual due to low pressure.

Haines Resident Advisor Ma<
ry Argenti called the city tire
department, which arrived in a
few minutes and quickly ex-
linguished the ﬁre,

There was no damage in any
items of furniture except the
chair, nor to any buildin

diihl! MATTER

By Bill Gray

There is nothing quite so pathetic as an I, Mr writer laboring
over an article when no I. M. events have occurred. But although
tennis and football are still a week away, Mac Frield and the en-
virons have seen more thall their share or feet practicing the in-
tricacies of the down and out. After viewing some practices, i can
yell that some of my predictions may prove to be rather absurd
by the time the season closes.

It is reputed that Rawson has a freshman who is faster than
the average Grinnellian, and with the advent of ﬂag rather than
touch football, the running game becomes more important. Raw-
son. if it can find a quarterback, should prove to be a power to
be reckoned with,

Smith and Clark played a rookie game which Smith won
rather handily. This is believed to have prompted the late evening
mining program which Clalk instituted last Monday night.

South, North and Langan have been practicing but they seem
to be using cement blocks for hands and. as a result, preseason
opinion has them filling the bottom of the league. Gates, which
was so good last year, looks to have fallen on hard times and
could have trouble winning even half of its games,

With Rick Bair (as in Bear) wearing in at a svelte 225 and
the likes of Roger Able carrying added poundage, Dibble should
Outweigh the opposition by about 30 pounds per man as they at-
tempt to go through their sixth straight year without incurring
more than one loss.

Cowles, West. and East are somewhat unknown quantities but
appear to be neither very good nor very bad. in any event, it's
D-Day minus one week.

TliE KIBBITZER

By John Ra:

Psyche bids can be a powertul weapon in your bidding ar-
lenal when you are careful to control partner’s range and ease of
response. in the following hand. South elected to open with one
diamond. a psychological asking bid, looking for diamond support
from partner in an anticipated nartrump contract. South was not
afraid of any of the possible responses: to two diamonds he was
prepared to bid two no-trump. e signoit; to either two clubs or
three diamonds he was prepared to bid three noti‘ump. Four or
five diamonds, the two dangerous bids that North could have
made. were abated because the partnership had agreed not to
jump an opening bid to the tour or tive level, Furthermore, South
Was not afraid of having the hand passed out since one diamond is
an easy bid to respond to or overcall. North made the correct re-
sponse of one spade. intending to make a delayed single raise in
diamonds signiiying 10-12 points and diamond support ~ too much
for a two diamond bid and too little for a three diamond game go-
ing bid. 0n the second round of bidding. South again intentionally
misrepresented his hand by bidding two clubs. At this point South
reasoned that if partner had a iive card spade suit he would re-
bid it and game would be played in {our spades. li North didn’t,
however. South intended to discourage a dangerous club opening
lead against a no»trump game, After North’s delayed raise in dia<
monds. South bid three no-trump which he had designed all along,
confident of a favorable lead. He counted 28 points. with possible
Suit fits in spades or diamonds. West hardly hesitated before
Opening the heart three. From the bidding West counted at least
eight cards in the minor suits in South's hand. Giving South two
spades. this would leave him a three card heart stopper. Assum<
ing that South held the A Q 10 x in Clubs and that South counted
upon turning two Club tricks, West; dared not give South a “tree
finesse" on an opening club lead. West chose what he thought
was the favorable “unbld major” and thus the deception was
complete. ‘ ‘

BOWERS’ BOYS GET READY FOR GRID ACTION

By JACK GOCHENOUER

Thirty-five men have come
out for iootball including all
but one available lettermen.
Coach Edd Bowers said there
is a good team attitude as the
squad will attempt to bounce
back from last year’s poor sea
son.

injuries, hard luck and a
poor aerial attack and defense
were the reasons for the 2-6
record. This year the gridders
are working on better passing
to supplement the strong run-
ning attack, Coach Bowers has
a heavy backfield with 205
pound fullback Dick Lamb pack-
ing the most punch. Lamb was
the leading ground gainer in
1965 but was sidelined most of
last fall with an injury

A blow to the team is the
loss of senior hack Jon Buswell
who is involved in an oft-cam-
pus study project. Last year
he was the leading ground gain-
er for the Pioneers with 383
yards Back again this year is
Rich Weeks who was second in
rushing with 355 yards and led
the passing statistics with 252
yards.

The newcomer most likely to
gain a ﬁrst string spot; is Steve
Carroll, a transfer last year
who'll be at center or tackle.
Other newcomers likely to see
considerable action are ends
Garry Bork and Bill Wedding
and backs Brent Dubach, Doug
Fink. and John Pederson. Du-
bach is a transfer'and the rest
are sophomores.

The first home game is a-
gainst St. Olaf Sept. 23. St. Olaf
is one of the toughest teams
in the conference but Bower’s
Boys promise to make it an
interesting game. Coach Bowers
hopes for a good student turn-
out for the game and feels that
this is a teanl of which the
student body can be proud,
