The Eyes Thai See

Business Asst.

Amid one or two jeers and a great deal of applause,
the Latin American Conference came to a close last Week.
Jeers from those few with eyes that are always “looking,
for something" who thought that the Conference was too
one—sided, applause from those of us who found the four
exciting days of discussion most interesting and informative.

The Conference as We see it, was not a series of “pro-
Castro” meetings and discussions, Mr. Shapiro and certain-
ly Mr. Alexander were not here only to advocate a pro-
Castro stand. They presented us with a good deal of in«
formed opinion which was at times complimentary to the
present Cuban regime, and more than occasionally suggest-
ed the many difficulties involved in complete acceptance
of the Castro government.

“The revolution in Cuba,” said Alexander, ”goes be-
yond Cuba and Castro and much, much deeper,"

If the Conference was at all weighted, t was weighted ‘
with clear thinking speakers who were able to back up
their opinions with experience and facts and with speakers
:vho were interested in presenting many sides of the ques«

lOn.

Furthermore, this conference was not concerned with
Cuba alone, Neither commentators nor panel members re
flected any pro-destination of the conference. If discussion
seemed to turn toward Cuba, it was because the Cuban
problem is a pertinent one.

Discussion often wandered back into the Cuban dif»
ficulty, not through the efforts of the speakers but
through the students themselves; who, as we have sug-
gested before, are becoming more aware of the problems
involved and more interested in learning as much as possi-
ble about this “in-the-news" area.

If the eyes that see more than is there and the ears
that hear only What they Want to hear want something
to yell wolf about, we might suggest a look into their own
furry faces. It is not the sort of talk which comes out of
the Latin American Conference but rather their own spe»
cial concoction of fairy-tale nonsense that deserves closer
scrutiny.

 

Bowen Sees Art, Fitness Emphasized;
Praises Conslilulion, Travel Grants

by Ruth Gruenewald

”New Developmenls at Gri -
hell" was the subiect of piesi—l
dent Bowen’s chapel speech!
Wednesday, in which he out-
lined some of the important cur—
rent developments concerning
the college. ‘

should be approached wilh the
excilemenl that comes from be-
ing u part of an interesting and
promising new educational
idea," rather than wilh n de-
featlst c: frightened attitude.

if the program proves success

In discussing the new consti-
tution, Bowen said. “No one is
perhaps fully satisfied wilh il,
in every detail, but I think there
is general acceptance of it As a
sound basis for orderly and
progressive sludcnl govern-l
ment.” He complimented those
students who hclpcd to ell-owl
il up, adding that “good governs
menl at any level is a product,
not so much of formal conslilu-l
tions, as of responsible citizen-
ship and wise and dcvolcd lead-
ciship.”

Bowen emphasized that lhc
constitution is directed toward
the college conununily as a
whole, although specific prob-
lems and inleresls of indi-
vidual halls and of north and

soulh campuses should not be

ignohed.

The president went to
speak about the junior year ex-l
aminations which will be given'
next year to the class of ’63
on an experimental basis. Hel
pointed oul the fact that “it'

on

 

ful, it “may eventually lead to

profound change in the educa-
tional program of the College."

Such changes would include
a reduction in the emphasis on
grades nnd individual courses.
and an increase in freedom of
students lo pursue their educa-
tion independently.

By offering credits to stu-
dents who successfully pass

the test, it is hoped that they
will be able to reduce their
regular coursc loud, thus leav»
ing lime for “reading, reflec-
tion, and pursuit of worth,-
whlle extracurricular in-
tenests."

In the area of physical edu-
cation and recreation Bowen ex-
plained the new system of non-
compulsory physical education
to be instituted next year. In
stead of having required classes
students will be Dbliyd to dem-
onstrate ability in swimming, in
a team sport and in a carry—over

To the Editor:

On the evening of Mondayi
March 13, I returnEd to the l'-

 

lord

had left my books was now bereft
of these, i made a Search of lhc
vici lityiand found nothing. Ex-
pressions like lifted, pllfered,
heisted and hacked come lo mind,
bul I dismissed them'immediately.

Surely not at Grinnell, lhe
Harvard of the Midwcsl, could
such a deed be perpetuated. A
fruitless trip to the assorted
Grinnell pawnshops confirmed
my fears. Truly, here Was a case
of common thievery.

Granted, I had sinned in leavA
ing a large black loose-leaf note-
book, a German text and a small-
er tan notebook to hold my place;
but surely if 100»odd other peo-
ple indulged in this, it must be
socially acceptable.

Bemused, I remembered that
the large notebook contained
all my notes for all my courses,
and that the German text con-
tained copious notes for a test
the following Friday.

I reflected stoically that, after

all, il could have been womb
someone could hnvc appropriated
my new gnu»fur lap robe which
i save exclusively for use in the
library of a chill night.

ll is perhaps time that Grinnell
should think seriously about the
bunch system. Al prcsenl We
seem to have reached lhc plalcuu
of ethical concern. somewhere in
our intellectual peripheries stands
lhc qualion cf the honor syslem.
Sporadically, the question asserts
itselffat gatherings likc the cue
lumn encampment — ils advo-
clltcs enclump lhcmsclves around
lbis question and some even agl-
late for il when they return lo
the Campus. .

i am nol so sure now that lhc
muchstouted system would suc-
ceed, but I am unduly pessimistic.
i must not allow myself lo be
soured on lhc intrinsic colleclivc
honesty of the Grinnell sludcnl
body lhrough one isolated inci-
denl, Surely lhjs way madness
lies, and lhc honor system will
eventually come lo pass.

Meanwhile, will the person
who made off with my book and
notebooks heed a fervent plea for
their return? Leave them on the
table by the main entrance of

bral‘y, some other obvious place

The week of the LAC.

5 The Latin American Confer-
lencc had such a great cifccl up—
on Grinnell students that any-
one nol speaking Spanish was
shunned and had to listen to the
proceedings over KGRW to a-
void being seen in public.
lThe Third Week of March
During this time, folk music
lwas the greatest lhing in lhe
world. A Mr, Finney came and
sang ethnically lo the tunes
plunked oul on a Mandoscella
with only six strings tuned like
a guitar. A Hootenany was held
in the Union wilh Peter Cohan
accompanying himself on Naida
Tushnet.

The Fourth Week in March
was the week of shaving off

We can hardly wait to see
what new non-conformity will

llS Peace Corps
, Will Teach, Work

1 by Craig Henderson

The Peace Corps, one of Pre—
sidem, Kennedy's pct projects,
is beginning to lake a definite
form and may be sending stu-
dents lo foreign countries by
next fall. Already there have,
been over 17,300 applicclions
submilled to the Corps. and the
four page, so question applica—
tion form is yel to be published.

The ‘Peace Corps will be com-
posed primarily of young college
graduates and non-college youlh
with special skills who will go
lu underdeveloped areas of the
world to “teach, build or work”
on a local level, This movement
has taken hold on campuses
throughout the United States
and especially in the Midwest
Conference. Grinncll may Very
likely contribute some of the
first members of the Corps.

According lo an announce-
ment published late last month
by the White House, colleges
and universities will be one of
five bases of recruilmem.

In addition, the Corps en-
courages young people to work
through private agencies, var-
ious government agencies such
as 10A and the U, s. Informa-
tion service, the U. N. and
direct recruitment program.

Members of the Peace Corps
will teach and work on health
projects, in agriculture, on con-
struction piojecls or in govern-
mcnl administration. il is hoped
that universities will cslnblish
training programs, and special
summer training sessions will be
inaugurated this Summer-

Students who speak a foreign
language, especially Spanish,
will be in line for leaching jobs,
while non-collage applicants with
special skills, such as construc-
tion wcrkers and factory per-
sonnel, will be used on local
level improvcmenl projects.

Those who participate in this
program will live among the
people wilh whom lhey work
nnd will receive from lhc Unit-
cd States government or spon—
soring agency no allowance for
food. housing and clolhing. Upon
their return, participants will
receive a $50-a-month bonus
paymenl. Men who participate
will be temporarily deferred but

Piitsch went from the small
junior college to Texas Uni-
versity where he graduated
two years later with a bathe»

Texas U, had the number one
tennis team in the nation while
Pfitsch was there, He was eighth
man on a squad which sent its
top two players to compete as
gninst one another for the ‘NCAA
title one year.

”We picked up a lot of valu-
able experiencc," says Pfitsch,
“from playing matches with
Wilmer Allison and Allen Van
Ryse, members of the Davis Cup
team of 193745, who used to
play on the Texas I]. courts."

Pfitsch got his start in coach»
ing from one of the greatest
men in the business, “PI-log”
Allen of the University of Kaila
|sas. “Dr. Allen brought his has»
kctball team to Texas once,"
said Plitsch, “and i asked him
for a lab He gave it to me."

“Dr. Allen was the greatest
, man I everknew,"saidPiitsch.

“He didn’t have any reason to
take me in at Kansas, but he
did, and he gave me a job as
trainer and let me work out
with his squads just like the
players."

The theory behind the new
program, stated Bowen, is that
“recreation flourishes when it is,
free and spontaneous rather
than when it is required."

the college will soon have an
artificial skating rink in operas
tion, complete with open fire
place, lights and music.

Plans will also be made for a
new union, swimming pool, wo—I
men‘s gymnasium, field house
and related structures. Bowen:
added, ”I believe that increased,
recreation and physical activity
is very important at Grinnell.
We all lead busy, and on the
whole sedentary lives, and we
need the :release and change of
pace that can be achieved,
through physical activity."

Another forthcoming de-
velopment at Grinnell con-
cerns the fine arts. in conjunc—
tion with the completion of
the Fine Arts building, next
year will see a special em-
phasis on the arts, an in-
creased number of concerts,
recitals, plays, lectures, ex-
hibits and other events.

Bowen said, “The purpose of
this building is not only to ims‘
prove our work in the arts for‘
those students who major in
these fields, but to bring the
arts increasingly into the lives
and consciousness of our entire
student body."

Grinnell, ‘Bawsn continued,

be discontinued. Students ln-l

advised to apply to the federal
program.

Dr. Bowen concluded his re~.

improve on last year's five win

.squ'dd, which placed third in the
Conference rncct, only Bill Me—
Clung was lost through gradua-
tion. He played in the number
three position,

Edd Bowers, who takes over
the coaching reins this ycar from
[W Simone. will have a lot of
talent to Work with. John Ru-
vaids, number one man from last
season, returns along with other
lcttermen Joel Prescott and Roger
Sternberg. The latter is out at
the present time with a knee in-
jury, but he is expected to return
to action shortly.

Perhaps the grealest interest
lies in this years sophomore
group. Last year's undetected
freshmen squad sends Guy Ash-
ton, li-a Keeshin and Jim Smith,

Coach Bowers rates Ashton as
one of the finest prospects he

has ever seen. The consensus

seems to be that, Ashtan will
immediately step into the num-
ber one position.

Other players expected to add
depth to the team are Bob Bram—
son, Tom Cook, Chip Salmon, Bill
Plan. and Dick Andersan,

The sirength of the rest. of the
Conference is unknown, but
Bowers believes that. this year's
squad will Tank with Grimeli’s

lfmest and can easily be rated as

one of the favorites for the Con-
ference crown.

The varsity will play its first
match at Cornell on April '1.
The following day the six man

Baseball Squall S

by Dave Buck

Eight returning lettermen and
several promising sophomores
form ii strong nucleus for Coach
John Pfitsch’s 1961 baseball club.
Last year the Pioneers finished
second in the Southern League
of the Midwat Conference with
a 4—4 record and sported a 5-8
season mark, but coach Pfitsch
looks for improvement this
spring.

“We should be a little better
this year," Pfitsch says. “We have
several promising sophomores
around in addition to a pretty
good pitching staff and a few
good hitters."

The Midwest Conference is di-
vided into a Northern League and
a Southern League, of which
Grinnell is a part, to compensate
for an approximate two week
head start in outdoor practicing
for the four southern teams. In
the Southern League along with
Crinnell are Cornell, Coe, Moh-
mouth and Knox.

Grinnell finished second in
the southern division last spring
behind perennial power Coe,
llul: baseball players are an op~
timistic lot, and there is lots
of talk about Crinnell winning
its first league championship
since baseball was reinstated at
Grinnell in 1957.

With the first game two and a
half weeks away, and since the
squad has been unable to work
outside, lineups are very indefin-
ite. At the present time it.looks
like the infield will have Jim

According to preeseason pre—
dictions, Grinnell ranks among

ference, with Carleton, the de-
fending champion, and Knox.
Grinnell was undefeated in Con-

'Lowry at first, either Art Peter-
son or Dale Furnish at second,
Gary Knarniller at short and
Chris Sprung at third.

The outfield should be consi-
derably better than last year’s
threesome with added speed and
hitting power. Returning Out-l
fielders include Dick Mittelbush.
er and Ron Ochsner, but they
will be hard pressed by three
outstanding sophs, slugger Bruce
Bell, and speedsters Howard
Bunton and Jack Freter.

The pitching start will prove
to be the strong point of the

squad with three promising
hurlcis, rack Meyer was last

year‘s leading pitcher with a
+2 record and a line L66 earn-
cd-run average.

Behind Meyer on the mound
will be Mittelbusher and 001157
ner. Roger Miller will probably
see most of the catching duty,
but Chris Sprung could fill in

]behind the plate if needed.

The season opener for Grinnell
will be Tuesday afternoon, April
11. at 3:30 here in Grinncll with
Simpson College. These two
clubs did not meet in 1960.
