GA vs. Faculty Committee in

Resolution Voted,
Protests Dralted
Ry SGA Branches

. By Bob Hodlemo

'A flurry of activity in all
branches oi the SGA with regard
to a dispute with the iaculty and
administration over jurisdictional
Ind due process violations has re-
sulted in one resignation, one
meeting, three stilt letters of com-
plaint, one executive cabinet-pri-
mary court proposal, and one
Student Senate resolution.

The dispute stems from faculty
and administration handling oi
student violations which SGA feels
the primary courts should handle.

resigned, saying in a letter to the
Com? th .

“The office of Chief Magistrate
of the Men's Primary Court seems
to have been proven defunct or
practically non - existent in the
past several months."

A meeting Tuesday afternoon oi
the Faculty Committee on Student
Ailairs, the executive cabinet,
the members of both primary
courts, the acting college presi—
dent, and the taculty chairman to
settle the dispute led the execu-
tive cabinet and the two primary
courts to say, in two separate let-
tors:

It is our impression that the
Committee is unwilling to make
any sort or commitment on points
of jurisdiction and due process,
and preters to maintain the pres-
ent system, which is unacceptable
to us."

Grossman. in his letter put it
more strongly:

“The courses of action, both
executive and judiciary, of the
administration and faculty coin-
mittees have stretched, cramped,
and all but erased the more con
crete delineation of jurisdiction
and due process which are round
in the SGA Constitution.”

Grossman went on to say that
the ”uncalledrior overstepping oi
jurisdictional lines by the admin-

One Suspended;w
Another in Court

Two women students have re-
cently been involved in disciplin-
ary actions by the college.

One woman was suspended for
three weeks in connection with the
illegal visitation of a nonecollege
man to her room. College stair
members saw what appeared to be
a prowler leaving the window of a
Woman's room about 7:00 a.ml
Feb, 13.

The suspension was handled by
the Faculty Committee on Student
Altairs alter the report was made
to the Dean of Women.

In another case, a woman was
reported for attempted illegal en-
try into the quadrangle alter
hours. The case which was initially
presented to the FCSA was com<
plicated by two previous latenesses
and incorrect representation of the
Iacts. This case, however, has now
been turned over to the Women's
Primary Court. The student court
heard the case last night, and the
decision is pending.

Students Okay
SGA Revisions

Amendments which a re de-
signed to streamline the Grinnell
student government were accepted
yesterday by the student body. By
a margin nt 435733, the students
voted to create an Advisory Coun-
cil to replace the Student Senate.

The amendments, which earlier
were okayed by the Senate 3“,
needed a 60% yes vote to pass;
they received 92%.

Only 43.1% of the students cast
ballots in the lunchline reieren«
dum. ,

in client, the revision makes the
operation at student government
more eiticient by cutting the size
of the legislature and combining
it with the excutlve branch.

The new Advisory Council will
be composed of 21 members — one
member from each hall, the Com?
president, and the SGA president.

it approved by the college ad-
ministration, the new system he-
comes effective after spring vaca-
tion.

- Also on the ballot was an amend-
ment which would allow SGA elec-
tions this year only to be held
later than the constitution calls
tor. This section passed by 96%:

Women's Weekend

B rings. Concerts, Film

By Krys Neumun

Women's Weekend, time of reck<
oning for all Grinnell men, starts
today. It features two concerts, a
Bergman ﬁlm, and a guest chapel
speaker.

Jazz singer Nina Simone per-
iorms Saturday night and the col-
lege orchestra plans a special con-
cert on Sunday. The movie “Virgin
Spring” can be seen Friday and
Sunday. The Reverend George
Suidy ol Oakland, California, will
speak on Sunday at 11 em. in Her-
rick Chapel.

This will be the weekend for all
Grinnell girls finally to chose the
man oi their dreams (or at least
one who happens to be sitting next
to them in physics class). Some
even look upon the whole proce-
dure as a truly educational expe-
rierlce; that is, learning the real
courage that is tested on north
campus every weekend of the year.

The idea of Women's Weekend
is casually to ask him to take a
walk, go swimming, come to open
house or a lounge party or to
study. Looking at pictures together
in the fine arts building or in the
Forum is recommended, as is din-
ner and snack dates (Cafe del Foro
would love the business).

The Forum offers unlimited 1105'
sibillties tor originalrtype dates
that were not available last year.
It’s the Grinnell girl's opportunity
to invade the pool room or TV
room, with escort, of course. It’s
her chance to prove her domestic
ventures in the new private kitch-
enettes and dining rooms. And it
she lasts through a hectic Friday
and Saturday (some girls have
been known to brave ten dates in
the Weekend — with ten different
escorts), she can spend a quiet

 

Sunday listening to folk and jazz
music in the listening room and
take advantage of the special tree
juko box music and special grill
prices Sunday night.

Seniors Picked
For Fifth Year

By Jeanette Mall

Names of the three seniors
who will be living and working
in foreign countries next year
under the Fifth YEar Abroad
Program were announced last
week by William Vanderpool
(speech and theater), coordina-
tor of the program.

Darlene Keeler will be in
Thailand, Don Bogue will be
at Ahmednagar College in In-
dia, and Barbara Cooper will
probably be in Columbia al-
though this assignment is not
definite. Rod Brown is alter-
nate for the Thailand appoint-
ment and Martha Dixon is the
alternate for India,

Members of the Grinnell class
or 1964 who are now serving
abroad are: Daniel Mahoney,
Brazil, John Spence, Colombia,
Paul Courtwright and Marie
Martin, India, Livija Denavs
and Martha Grodzins, Thailand.

The Fifth Year Abroad is the
Grinnell College “little Peace
Corps." Students are repre»
sentatives of their country and
their school. Vanderpool says
that interest in this program
has declined since the founda-
tion of the Peace‘Corps.

The program is directed by
the Committee on internation-
al Studies Program.

 

 

Court Feud

SGA Grills Stauss
0n Court Powers;
Issues Still Vague

By Arthur Yellln

"There are probably a few is-
sues there," was the opinion of
Dean James H. Stauss, Acting
President of the College, on the
dispute over court jurisdiction
in cases 0! student violations.
Stauss spoke in a “question and
answer" period at Wednesday
night’s Senate meeting.

In Stauss’s viewpoint, due proc-
ess does exist at Grinnell, but
governmental processes need im-
proved definition and communica-
tion, Replying to a student’s ques-
tion, he said that he did not think
due process can have the same
lorm in all areas of the college.
Stauss's remarks remained vague:
he did not think jurisdiction could
be defined in a formula-like mane
ner in terms of types of olienses.

Stauss said that student court
handling of some conduct cases
apprehended by the administra-
tion is appropriate. In other cases
student court handling is not ap-
propriate. he had no objections,
however, to the student govem-
ment recommendations related to
due process, except for the right
of the accused person to know the
Source or the accusation. .

Shortened Interim
Possible Next Year

The 1965-66 college calendar
may include an “abbreviated
interim" prior to the start of
the second semester, acting
President James H. Stauss said
this week.

Under the tentative plan, stu-
dents would be able to return
to school after Christmas Vaca-
tion on January 12. The first
two or three days would be
devoted to such concerns as the
Rosenfield Lectures.

Senior comprehensive exams
and the Junior Liberal Arts
Exam would be given January
14 and 15. Classes would begin
January 11.

Stauss said that this plan
would enable juniors and sane
iors to get re-oriented before
taking their Comprehensive
exams.

Stauss also noted that one
consideration in dropping the
regular interim was that it was
too financially burdensome.

living Up

By Carl Otls Gray

In the past two weeks I have constantly been
amused by the responses to my last article. it
seems that by_attacl-iing America’s sacred cows
1 provoked an overwhelming majority or my read-
ers. Paul Roberls' column last week took particu-
lar care to note the “depth of my hatred” im-
plying that l was “vicious, hateful, bigoted, narrow-
minded and arrogant." it seems that. Mr. Roberts
and Company need some setting straight. l intend
to live up to my reputation -— so Mr. Roberts, I’ll
be arrogant enough to defy anyone who tells me
I have no right to do so.

it there are any other self established experts
on the Negro mind in the audience l would urge
them in forever hold their peace, because they
cannot and never will begin to scratch the surlace
of a problem with which they have never come face
to race. 1 have a right to be presumptious enough
to say that no one. save another Negro. can tell
me anything about civil rights. While liberal or
not, I knew more about American democracy, or
whatever it should be called, at the age of ten than
you will even be able to know. As the hypocrisy that
calls itself acceptance wends its way into our lives,
new hypocrlsies will slowly be uncovered and ran
vealed. Don’t tell me how I Should [eel about being
given the privilege ut living in this wonderiul "ldylr
lic" community because i could not be less interest.
ed. Realize this, you're doing me no lavors.

it you honestly want to delve into that thing
that you all know so well, “the Negro mind,” ask
Eddie Atkins’ four year old sister who was beaten
up by her iellow kindergarten students because she
was a Negro. Ask the children who were herded
through the streets of Selma what it means to
be an American. Then and only then can we begin
to converse on a level with me as the teacher and
you as the student.

Until I was so dubbed by Iellow Grinnell stu-
dents as an embittered young man, l had never
considered myself as such. But if that is the case,
well then, “you ain’t seen nothin' yet." I would
suggest that it any of you are interested in pursuing
the development of bitterness in the American Ne-
gro you should read (he works or w. E. DuBois to
begin with and then as you graduate to the rela:
tively techie voice or James Baldwin you hold
your stomach and read LeRoi Jones' personal
statement in Kulchul‘ 9, the one that ends with his
final word to Negroes — CUT THEIR THROATS!
All that: men are distinctly out of the realm of
hlaclr Nationalist, Black Supremist movements, so
that charges oi ianatictsm are totally invalid. Alas,
even James Baldwin, In a debate with William F.
Buckley at Cambridge last week mirrored my
views by stating “The American Dream is held at
the expense or the Amerlcari Negro.”

And furthermore — get the hell off my back,
you've been on it long enough; it's my turn.

Paul Roberts
Roberts Rules Of Disorder

As spring approaches — slowly - a young man's
fancy turns lightly to thoughts of love and base-
ball and tennis and like that.

Not so at Grinnell, Men of normally sound
sense turn rather heavily to nights or lancy or, to
be more explicit, to thoughts of SGA elections.

This year — even before the sap has started to
run - some ol the “edge" has been taken off the
election. SGA has been simpliﬁed. Alas, no more
complex procedure, no more “cumbersome checks
and balancas," no more unwieldly Senate sessions.
In short, no more charm.

Lest titer: be any contusion, SGA was and re-
mains a game to he played by campus politicos,
devoid oi any significance or importance. lt ac-
complished little before. It will accomplish little in
the luture. It cannot possibly do more than set petty
penalties {or petty oilenses, argue petty points in
a petty manner, and create sell~inflated images of
importance tor its ofﬁcers.

By simplifying the game. by reducing the num-
ber of players, by making the rules easy to under-
stand. the game has lost any challenge. Embroil-
merit and experience in practical political pro-
cedure was the only accomplishment of SGA. Now
we‘ve removed that.

The advance or spring at Grinnell usually brings
thoughts or the gall Course by night, water lights
and — the greatest circus at all — the sen con-
vention. Almost as a corollary to SGA’s loss o!
charm, it looks at ii there might not be I conven-
Klan.

In order to have a convention, there must in
three people ioolish enough to want the job of SGA
president. Seemingly we have no such huﬂoons. "l‘is
a pity. You would think that on a campus or this
size and nature, there would be at least three peo-
ple willing to play the larce or SGA president.

Or perhaps the board scores have gone up so

Magee Relutes Viet Nam Column.

Wants Balanced.

To The Edltor:

Regardless or the proprieties in-
volved, i feel forced to take issue
with Mr. Goddard's recent article
on Viet Nam. It contains that com-
bination of realism, idealism, fac-
tual misstatement, Ialse logic
and an occasional perceptive in-
sight which ls typical of most cur-
rent analysis of the war in Viet
Nam and which succeeds in only
hopelessly confusing our thinking.

He states that one reason Viet
Nam is a poor place to make a
stand is the combination of impener
trable jungles and fragile govern-
ments. He argues that it is tool-
ish to take stands in areas where
topigraphical and strategic condi-
ntlons are unfavorable. First of all,
Viet Nam is by no means all
jungle — the real area of conflict
is the rich rice producing delta of
the Mekong River — and besides
jungles are not really impene-
trable today, especially in South
Viet Nam.

Furthermore, were governments
not fragile, subversion and civil
wars would be unlikely occur-
rences. insisting on taking stands
only where the governments are
“non-fragile" would eliminate the
West from attempting to influence
the situation in much of today's
world. Any government in the un<
derdeveloped world — and India
is a good example — is likely to
become more, rather than less,
fragile if it has to cope with the
problems of rapid modernization
plus subversion partially organized
and supported from the outside.

It is again wishiul thinking to
believe that our enemies or oppon-
nents (leaving mem unidentiiied
for now) Will choose to challenge
us in areas where the strategic
and topographical conditions fa-
vor us. The point about guerrilla
nl' revolutionary warfare is that
it is a weapon that does not re

Factual Analysis

say, then, what he proposes, but
one can only assume he is suggest-
ing withdrawal, Does this have a
“foundation in political reality,"
however? Or do we then make it
clear to friends and foes alike that
the real lesson from Viet Nam is
that is partially successlul guer-
rlla warfare operation over diffi-
cult terrain in unstable societies
will mean an American (and
therefore probably Western) With-
drawal? Might it not be better to
hang on for as long as possible,
make it as difficult for the enemy
as possible and hopefully learn
some Valuable lessons for the
next encounter — which will sure
ly come? (See the recent report in
the N.Y. Times on the beginnings
in Thailand, February ll, 1965.)

i am not arguing ior this policy
or against it; I am arguing for a
more balanced and factual assess-
ment of the Viet Nam situation
which as Mr. Goddard recognizes
only a simpleton Will have simple
answers for.

By way of conclusion, although
many matters remain that should
be discussed (such as the perva-
siveness of corruption and author«
itarianism of one branch or an-
other in most governments of the
underdeveloped world), Mr. God-
dard has one consolation. If his
analysis proves to be correct, he
obviously wins. But if i have
shown it to be somewhat defec-
tive, he is still excused since he
learned his political science in my

‘Shades of Gray'

Too Slanted Says

Anonymous Reader

To The Editor:

I happened to pick up your
paper while visiting a friend’s
home and read the article
“What the New World Hath
Wrought" by Carl Otis Gray,
which I think is downright
nasty or should I say "sick,
sick, sick.”

Mr, Gray should realize that
“time marches on” not only
in beauty aids, but also science.
medicine, foods, etc, But he
should not limit these artificial
beauty aids to the white female
only as you can see these some
products being used by all
races and all to the good. I

might add On television and ,

on the streets you can notice
how the appearance of all
women has improved and has
also aided in securing employ-
ment. So let the’ “non-White
male" take a good look at the
female of his race and he will
find himself “lusting" after
her.

As for as interracial love is
concerned, that too has been
changing toward the better, but
since conditions like this were
existing since days of the cave
man on, there probably will
always exist in all countries
so much of this. Mr. Gray evi-
dently is referring to the Civil
War era and before, but to-
day, in modern times, it is
not a ”cash and carry rela~
tionship” confined only to the
colored races and the white,
but more a matter of choice of
the individual Concerned.

Girls Wonder About Women’s Weekend,
Challenge Appropriateness of Tradition

To The Editori

After observing [W0 Women’s
Weekends, we have come to
question the appropriateness of
continuing the tradition of
Women’s Weekend from the
standpoint of the attitudes ex-
pressed by both men and Wom-
en.

is it appropriate or worth
while to continue a social func-
tion such as Women‘s Weekend
in which dating norms are com-
pletely reversed and both men
and woman are placed in oft-

times awkward and embarrasur
ing situations? We cite the fol»
lowing examples: (a) Making
the date — the embarrassing
complications of neither person
knowing the other; (b) Break-
ing the data — no elucidation
necessary.

Judging from opinions ex-
pressed by both men and wom-
en there are those who are at
best disenchanted and at worst
annoyed by the custom of Worn-
eri's Weekend.

Candles Plus Hawk
Equal No Romance

To The Editorl

There is one place on this
Bampus where small groups of
people can gather in privacy
and comfort for a relaxing
evening away from the usual
atmosphere of this campus: in

one of the private dining rooms

in the Forum. So one night
four of us tried this new treat
and found it leaving too much
to the imagination.

In a futile attempt to create a
romantic atmosphere (the effort
is limited by a large picture
window facing a sidewalk and
Burling Library, through which
you can see your friends pass-
ing by and the library where
you really ought to be studying),
we planted a large candle on
the dining room table and ex-
tinguished the lights. After din<
nor and clean-up, we settled in
The dining room for a leisurely
evening of bridge. We discov-
ered that this one candle was
sufficient to see iihe cards by,
so we left the other lights out
in the dining room but did leave
the light on in the connecting
kitchenette.

After a brief interval, the
peace of the evening was
shattered by a piercing poundr
ing on the door, followed by a
sharp command, “Lights have
to be on at all times."

Now I will grudgingly admit
that some light is apparently
necessary to protect the female
members of our college society
from being violated against
their wishes. Yet it is a verifi-
able fact (that even the most
minimum of light in such a
mom allows all who would pass
by the expansive window the
opportunity to witness every
movement (or lack thereof) of
the occupants. The necessity of
having some large light beam-
ing into our faces seems ridicur
lous, as well as successfully
destroying any Romantic (note
the capital letter) dreams we
may have about life, love, and
candlelight dinners.

I have been told that the
Forum Committee never dis-
cussed this point or agreed
on this policy. If this is so, then
I hope that the students on the
committee will request such a
discussion.

And even if in some brief mo.
ment of antirRomantic madness
they unwittingly agree to such
a policy, I hope that in retro-
spect they will review their de
cision and reverse it.

Until then, many Hawkish
eyes protect our fair young
maidens from any undesired
violation of their innocence.

Quickie Cook's Tour of LeMoyne
Relayed from S&B Correspondent

Ed. Note: This is the second
of a series of articles by
Cynthia Brust, one of the
four Grinnell students par-
ticipating in an exchange pro—
gram at LcMoyne College
this semester.

“Good morning, ladies and
gentlemen! Welcome to the
Cook’s tour of the LeMoyne
College campus. Tile time is
now 9:00. We will complete our
tour in sixnandvarhalf minutes,
and then proceed with our tour

of Memphis itselfr Follow me,
please . . ."

And it could be done in six
and a half minutes, tor the cam-
pus is tiny. Even if we stop at
the green house Where Mike
and Jim live, and walk up the
street to the 4-Way Grill where
we eat when we don’t want to
cook, we could make it; in 10
minutes. But come with me on
a Grinnell tour instead, and
really look at LeMoyne Col-
lege.

We’ll start from Walker Ave-
nue, and enter the campus un
der the arch which tells the
world that this is LeMoyne.
Across a plot of grass strugr
gling to turn green is the impos-
ing Brownlee Halll This is the
architectural and academic
center of campus. Most of the
classrooms and all of the ad-
ministration offices are here, as
well as the bookstore and a stu-
dent lounge. It is built like a
Souuhern mansion, complete
with four columns in front In»
side the main door is the foyer.
And the bulletin board. When-
ever you want to spend time,
or want to find out something,
this is the place. This bulletin
board is noon announcements,
the post office throwaways,
and the 5&8, mlled into one.

Back out on campus, we turn
left and find Steele Hall, the
science building. Since I make
it a practice to stay away from
places like that, i haven’t the
vaguest idea what it's like.
Maybe someday one of the boys
will tell you.

Across from Steele Hall is

the Hollis F. Price Library, the
pride of the campus. This is
where you go if you are looking
for anyone. The inside of the
tworstory library is dominated
by a gigantic mural which
faces the doorl Created by Ben
Shahn, it Carries the biblical
verse which begins, “Behold
how good it is for brethren to
dwell together in peace.” It’s
a beautiful and fascinating piece
of art; you can spend hours
staring at it instead of reading.

Diagonally across campus,
near where we began, is Presi-
dent Price’s home. It is red
brick, and built very much like
Brownlee, but without the pil-
lars. Next is an old gray frame
house which serves as the So-
cial Science Building. It also
houses the only art lab room on
campus, and a few professors.

And then the Commons.

one room, and the rest of the L»

‘Faces of Mexico'

Photo Exhibit

Makes Debut in Forum Saturday

By Bob Hodierne

“Faces of Mexico,” a photo-
graphic art exhibit resulting
from [he eight-day, 3200»mile
interim study project of two
Grinnell students, will make its
debut Saturday morning in the
bulletin board area opposite
the Forum desk.

The exhibit. is the brain Child
of John Phillips and Henry Wilr
helm. The two bearded students
made their photographic safari
in a'VW and, during the course
of the trip, [00k 600 pictures.
The Show will feature about 50
of those.

The two say the trip wasn’t
originally planned with on eye
toward an exhibit. In fact, they
say, the trip wasn't really
planned at all. It just happened.

Not until nearly the end of
their trip did the idea of an ex-
hibit occur to them. “Twenty-
four hours away is an entirely

 

different culture," said Phil-
lips, “Most people don’t. realize
that. We thought we’d bring it
baCk.”

“We wanted to show some of
the many facets of Mexico,”
said Wilhelm, a 21-year-old
freshman who served a year in
Bolivia as a member of the
Peace Corps. “We wanted to
show Mexico’s beauty as well
as its povertyl"

Their photographic studies
sweep from wealth and plush
night-life lo bulliighting to the
children of the Monterrey
slumsr

The two achieve their most
dramatic results in their photo-
graphs of the people, especial-
ly the children The faces of the
children say more of the life of
the peasant than could ever
hoped to be said in Words. The
exhibit is truly a remarkable
Work of art.

of the future dormitory and

Between this vacant lot and
the Common is a group of three
white cottages, separated by
red brick paths. The one closest

box, is where Meg and I live.

t Jurisdictional Feud Rages

(Continued [mm Page 1)

“vaguely justified on grounds oi
expediency, convenience, inrgctrul-
ness, psychology, or absence of
testimony at evidence; the relative
value or rationale at these excuses
has uilen seemed in be as less
than effectively penetrating."

Dean James H. Stauss, Acting
President of the College, said in 8
question and answer period at
Wednesday night's Senate meeting
that:

“I know of no agreements that
have been made that say the Stu-
dent dean or faculty committee
must, by reason of law, take a
matter of student conduct and
turn it over to a student court.
However. the deans do have dis-
cretion to do this."

Slauss went on to say:

“Student courts were created
in the student government consti-
tution and linked to student ap—
prehension. That jurisdiction is
clear. Any drought of cases in the
student courts is nourished by stu-
dent enforcement agencies as well
as by the deans."

When asked for his reaction to
Siauss's answers in the jurisdic-
tional and process conflict, Phil
Johnson. SGA President, said, “Dr.
Stauss was speaking for himself
and did not make clear college
policy."

The letters of the primary courts
and executive cabinet to the Fac-
ulty Committee on Student Affairs
demanded a reply by March 3, say-
ln :

ii1r no satisfactory response is
forthcoming by that date, we will

assume that your committee and
the administration of the college

 

have opted for the present sys-
tem ui jurisdiction and procedure.
As we have explained, this system
is not acceptable to us, and we
would he forced to reevaluate
our role within it."

Wednesday aftemoan in a stu-
dent government coffee hour,
Adena Peterson, Chief Magistrate
oi the Women's Primary Court.
and Jerry Goddard. a member of
the Men's Primary Court, both
said that to them, “re-valuate"
meant resign. The implication was
that the other members of the
courts felt the same way.

when asked if he thought the
Faculty Committee could act by
next Wednesday, Stauss said. “I
don't mink they can hash it over
that fast.”

The executive cabinet and the
primary courts, in a joint resolu-
tion that was adopted by the stu-
dent Senaie Wednesday night by
Vale of 294, outlined jurisdiction
saying:

“Any case apprehended by A
Student ofﬁcer shall be heard by
the student court System. unless
the courts refuse jurisdiction or

refer the case to another body.”
The second pm hi the resolu-

tion outlined what the executive
cabinet and the primary courts
(alt should be “due process."

in a letter Wednesday to the
Faculty Committee on Student M»
fairs, the Com? concurred with
the proposals submitted by the
primary courts and the Student
Senate.

The AWS Board was preparing
to sign the same letter as the
paper went to press.

Progress Not Rapid
In Lock Installation

Progress on having lacks put on
women's doors will not be rapid
because there is nothing in the
present budget {or this purpose,
Acting President James H. Slauss
Said this week.

Stauss noted that the budget
must be augmented by the Board
01 Trustees if locks are to he in-
stalled.

Stauss maintained that because
of certain priorities, the adminis-
lraliun “hasn't entered into [I10
necessary consideration" at locks.

If the decisinn is made to install
locks. “the speed of installation
will depend on what Buildings and
Grounds can allot to do the in ,"
he Said.

Waki Praises 5&B’s

Progress in Scope

To the Editor:

The commentary on the Viet
Nam situation by Mri Gerald
Goddard was most welcome.
Though there was nothing es-
pecially new in his analysis, it
was very delightful to find in
the Scarlet and Black‘such an
article dealing with the press-
ing problem with which the
United States is facing now.

If this indicates a change in
the policy of the sail; to try to
liberalize our minds from 10-
calism, it is certainly a pro-
gress for. which i have long
been waiting. Kunio Waki

FRANTZ GRASS A REBOUND off ills Grinnell boards.

 

Franiz Approaches Scoring Mark;
Pioneers Journey Up lo Wisconsin

Grinnell’: up and down
cagers will be trying for their
first road victory in nearly two
months when they travel to
Wisconsin this weekend to face
Midwest Conference foes Ripon
and Lawrence

The Ripon game is slated for
7:30 pm. today and the Lawr-
ence tilt {or 1210 p.111. tomor-
mw.

Jeff Frantz continued his red
hot shooting, firing in 41 and 33
points in last weekend's pair
with Coe and Heloit. The 74-
point blast moved him to the
top of the loop scoring race
with 267 markers and a 24.2 av-
erage.

Overall, the 6-2 junior who
can play guard, forward, or
center, has rammed in 368
points for a 24.3 average and
has topped 30 points six times.
Now only 78 points shy of the
Pioneer season record of 445
notched by John Musser in
mass, Frantz appears a vir-
tual cinch to crack it, probably
during the Monmouth rKnox
series here on March 5-6.

Frantz is also the top Pioneer
rebolinder with 129. He claimed
a personal high of 18 against
Coe and added nine against Be-
lnit to pace Gr‘innell both days.

“I thought. we played some of
our best ball of the season dur-
ing the first half of the Coe

 

game, especially on offense,"
Pfitsch stated. “And I was
proud of the way our boys
stood off Coe's second half
challenge and then won the
game in overtime. They looked
very tired against Beloit Sat-
urday. I assume the Coe game
took a lot out of them.”

Pfitsch will go with the same
lineup he used last weekend,
Joining Frantz, Tom Hill, and
Elliott Hibbs on the starting
five will he Ted Risser and Bob
Watt.

Starting tor the first time,
Watt collected 17 points against
the Kohawks and ﬁnes and
turned in good floor perform-
ances.

Clyde Smith will again see
heavy duty in the front line.

Ripon, which moved Into the
loop lead with a 58-62 win over
Lawrence on Saturday, is led
by the scoring of Jim Cahoon
(21.3 average) and Roger Beck
(16.4 average) and the rebound
ing of Willie Alexander Rogers.
Now 9.5, the Redmen topped
Grinnell 71-68 here early in the
season.

Lawrence, now eighth with a
6-8 mark, dropped a 95-72 cone
test at Grinnell. Tom Steinmetz
and Earl Hoover are the big
Viking guns. Both are averag-
ing more than 17 points per
game.

Women’s gym. There will be a

Lorinda Yeisley, WRA president.

termined by elimination games

this year’s tournament. Each hall
may enter one singles player and
one doubles team. Additional
tables have been moved into the

Next weekend will give the bad-

discretion in giving cases lo the
student courts. Students have
maintained that there is a dearth
of cases in the student courts, but
Stauss supported the use of admin-
istrative discretion in dealing with
cases sufficiently serious to involve
questions of suspension or dismis-
sal and in the handling of certain
other cases.

Staiiss acknowledged that many
possibilities of error exist: in con-
nection with due process and juris-
diction, but he stated, “it's typi-
call with courts in general." Ad-
mittedly, he said, a need exists
for a common rationale of penal-
ties in student courts, student dean
offices, and the Faculty Commit-
tee on Student Affairs.

Michel, Barnes Win
Weekend Matches

By Lee Rothstein

Morgan Michel wrestling in
the heavyweight class for Grin—
nell turned in his most out-
standing performancc of ﬁre
season last Friday. He defeated
his opponent in the final peri-
od with an escape and gave the
varsity matmen a 19-16 victory
over Monmouth.

Contributing to the victory
were Bill Barnes with a deci-
sion, Ken Struhler, with a pin,
Mike Deatherage with a deci-
sion and captain Larry Miller
with a pin.

Saturday Grinnell hosted a
quadrangular meet with guests
Westmar, Simpson, and Coe.

In the meet Grinnell sported
50 points. second only to West»
War with 25 points.

Grinnell wrestler Bill Barnes
at 123 was the only home grape
pier to make it through the
finals as he decisioned his op-
ponent 574.

Although Barnes was the only
successful Grinnell wrestler in
the final round, Commendation
certainly must be given to Ken
Strubler at 130 who wrestled
one of his most outstanding
matches. Strubler, who earlier
in the day pinned Oliver oi
Coe, succumbed to the West-
mar opponent 7-8 on riding
time.

Pioneers Whip Kohawks But Drop
Saturday Game to the Buccaneers

l By Steve Casey

The Grinnell basketball team
avenged an earlier loss to (Joe on
Friday night with an overtime
victory but ran out of gas on Sat
urday and were trounced by Bel—
.lt. The Pioneers switched into a
[unrandrshoot oiferise which was
bhown by the 382 points that were
Icored over the weekend. Included
Were the 105 points Grinnell scored
against (Joe to break the school
Icoring mark of 102.

The Coe game was a wild affair
that included a goal tending
charge on Coe, two calls on the
Kohawks [or being in the lane too
soon on a free throw, and a pop-
burn-throwing Kuhawk tan. Coe

ell‘l the lead for the first six min-

tes until Ieit Frantz scored a

basket to give the Pioneers a laid
lead.

Later in a five minute stretch
‘Grinnell outscored' Coe 17-5 to take
g 3843 lead. For the rest of the

alt Coe could not get closer than
eight points and Grinnell eventuab
ly took a 5744 lead into the locker
room.

The Pioneers took their greatest

lead of sixteen points right after‘

the second half started. But Skip
lwan led a Coe rally that de-
creased Grinnell’s lead to three
goints, 6663, with 14:15 left. Swan
cored ten of the nineteen Kohawk
points while Grinnell could only
manage six points.

Grinnell held onto leads of two
to eight points until Coo tied the
ucorc 90% with four minutes left.
‘ big break came twelve seconds
ater when Skip Swan fouled out.
Meanwhile, Grinnell had taken a
33-90 lead. But the Pioneers could
not hold the lead and Larry Shry-

 

ock sent the game into overtime
with a basket with 22 seconds left.
The score alter regulation time
was 98-98.

in the overtime Rick Crawford
scored to give Coe a 100-98 lead
with 3:40 remaining. The Pioneers
retaliated with the next seven
points, though, to win the game
105-100. Elliott Hibbs got four of
the points while Jeti Ftantz added
the other three.

Jeli Frantz won the game's scor-
ing honors in a battle with Skip
Swan. Jeff made fourteen 01
eighteen shots from the floor and
thirteen of nineteen free throws in
scoring 41 points. Swan made four-
teen of twenty—one shots from the
flour and nine of ten free throws
in leading Coe with 37 points.
Other top scorers were Tum Hill
with 22 points, Hibbs Wlth 21, and
Larry Shryock with 21.

Frantz also led all rebounders by
hauling down l8. Hill added it) for
the Pioneers while Shryoek had 14
and Swan 11 for the Kohawks. Coe
as a team outrebounded Grinnell
4640.

The Beloit game is better for-
gotten than written about. The
Pioneers seemed dead on their feet,
and the 8qu rolled over them.
With Bob Rudolph and Phil Wool-
ley dominating the boards, the
Bucs soared to a 57-33 half-time
lead when many smart fans left.

The Bucs continued the ram-
page in the second half as coach
Pfitsch desperately rotated his
players looking for some type of a
winning combination. The 3qu
took their biggest lead at 33 points
89-56 with eight minutes left. They
finally took a 99-78 win over the
hapless Pioneers.

A DIALOGUE
Time: Anachronistic

Place: The Grimnell College
campus

Prof. Apathy smarts;
doest thou?

Duard Kawtindeact: Without.

Smarts: Prithee. Why art thou
in the stocks? Hast thou
mouseth in yon South Room
of the Castle?

Duard: Nay, Sire. A vile fate
hath descendeth upon me. A
fortnight ago an lM bailbas—
ket game did I engage in,
which rather late starteth, as
does: run the usual course of
things. Hustle did I my arst
to the drawbridge, whereup<
on to my dismay and misfor<
tune, the knights in gray did
raise the drawbridge high be-
fore me, as it was past knaves
hours. Being of quick wit and
agile mind, I swammed
stealthily and silently across
the moat and called upward to
my room window, whereupon
the night watchdog grabbeth
me and escorteth me bodily
to yonder Main Gate, You
mayest see what insidious
punishment hath befailen me.
I were condemned to these
stocks for seven days.

Smarts: Woe is you! Definite-
ly art thou in a tragic plight,
but with some justification.
Who condemnest thou?

Duard: Ye Old Roundtablc on
Student Affairs. It were they
by which this dirty deed were
done.

Smarts: What is this madness?
Is this atrocity of rights to be

How

 

defined as the due process of
fairplay? Is there, in this
world, no justice? What is
the normal course for deeds
considered of such a nefari-
ous nature as yours?

Duard: The normal Course,
sire, though somewhat less
than wellrdefined, would seem
to lead to the Knaves Pri-
mary Court, but the Chief
lady-inrwaiting deemed it
otherwise. We are irrespom
sible and immature, lest you
forgetteth.

Smarts: Tell me, Knavo Duard,
how be it otherwise?

Duard: Without.

Smarts: Thou appearest of good
physical stature. How be the
I. M. program? The referees,
receive they still the same
niggardly compensation, a
measly half dollar? Does Sire
Fill and his Board still labor
and grunt in contemplation of
The Clinic for Better Officiat-
ing?

Duard: Well spoken, on the first
count, sire. Yes, an actuality
has the clinic become, Start
will it this summer, and fine
time.

Smarts: Mayhaps the tide of
good fortune shall come in
the spring.

Duard: Bad herbs, sire. No
spring is there to be. Can-
celled, has it been, by the
wicked witch of the South.

Pioneer Frosh Hoopsters Lose Game;
Able, Musser, Schwartz High Scorers

By Don Kurasch

Cornell easily rolled by Grin-
nell last Tuesday night in Dar-
by, out, in a frosh basketball
game that turned out to be
about as exciting as the read«
ing of the Student Senate min-
utes at a house meeting. with
a little more than 39 minutes
left to play in the game, Cor-
nell went ahead 270, after which
the Grinnell yearlings were
never able to catch up.

Everyone on Coach Barry M.
Anderson's bench was able to
get in on the iree-for-all, with
center Roger Able pacing the
Pioneers with 18 points. Nears
1y every other member of the
squad contributed to the scor-
ing, with Mike Schwartz and
Dick Musser each tallying 13,
Greg Rankin connecting for a
season low of 9, Jim Poison hit-

ting for 1, Ron Cogswell adding
6, and Dave Donahoe and Don
Southworth coming through
with 3 and 4 respectively. Also
in the game for the Pioneers
was guard Russ Heukendcrf,
who was able to tally several
fouls,

stake when Grinnell and Cor-
nell, the Midwest Conference’s
two swimming powers, collide

tomorrow.

“Dilly," a wooden decoy, an-
nually goes to the loop team
boasting the best dual meet recs
0rd.

Both teams'bring undefeated
records into the meet and I
harvest of new pool and school
regards appears likely. Grinnell
has brushed aside eight or
ponents with ease and the
Rams have Whipped seven foes
by equally large margins.

Coach Irv Simone plans to
stick with his regular Pioneer
lineup:

Ray Langham. Bill Lontz, and
Howard Schein, sprints; Ralph
Pray, Bill Batschelet, and
Langham, distance; Ken Adel-
man and Eric Jacobson, butter-
fly; Tony Horton and Charley
s c h n ell, backstroke; John
Kraai and John Ehrig, breast
stroke; Kraai and Schnell, in
dividual medley; and Richard
Lance and Roger Abendroth,
diving

Adelman, Horton, and Kraaf
are all unbeaten in their spe-
cialties. They also swim on the
all-winning 400~yard medley-
foursome.

Pray has been topped only
once in the SOC-yard freestyle.

Cornell boasts a balanced
squad that has claimed a host
of new marks. Among the Ram
leaders are sprinter George
Waltman, distanceman Tom
Steinberg and butterfiyer Phil
Gibbs, all of whom havo‘
claimed new school standards.

The Ram medley and.free<
style foursomes have also
turned in record breaking ef<
forts. -

Action is also planned be-
tween the Pioneer and Ram
freshman swimmers.

Track Meet Thursday

The trackmen of Grinnell will
travel to Cedar Rapids on
Thursday to face Cue in their
initial dual meet of the indoor
season.

Field events will begin at
3:30 p.m.; running events at
4 00 p.m.

 

hustle on the part of the Pio~
neers, allowing the Cornell
frosh to tally their first win of,
the year, there were several,
individual performances worth
mentioning. Forward Rankin
displayed some good moves,
effectively shaking the men on,
him, Schwartz had a nice touch
on offense, though, like the rest
of the team, showed little‘
hustle on defense. Musser and
Able seem to have the poten».
tial to be valuable additions to
the varsity squad next year.
