Violate Iowa Fire Safety laws

By StaiI Reporters

The 5&3 learned last week
that the locking of the leggia
doors in the women’s dorms on
south campus is a clear vio—

lation of Iowa State iire reg- ‘

ulations.

Wilbur R. Johnson, State Fire
Marshal, told the 5&3 that
all public buildings are re-
quired to have “panic-type ex-
its” and that inside keyed locks
such as those presently used
on south campus, are outlawed
under Section 103.8 at The lowa
Code and under Section 1.2 of
[own State Fire Safety Rules
for Dormitories which reads:

“Exits shall be so arranged
and maintained as to provide
tree and unobstructed egress
from all parts of every build-
ing or structure at all times
when the building or struc-
ture is occupied. No locks or
fastenings to prevent tree es-
cape irom the inside or any
building shall be lnstalled on
exit doors.”

Johnson said that Grinnell
College, according to his re-
ords, has never had a state
tire inspection even though all
schools, colleges and univer-
sities, both public and private,
are required to have one every
two years under Section 10031
of the The Iowa Code.

When asked when Grinnell
College would be inspected John-
son said “Golly, I couldn't tell
you, we want to get it done
as soon as possible The Iowa
law does require them. . . ."

When contacted again this
week Johnson told the 5&3
that his office would conduct
a complete inspection of Grin-
nell College in early March and
the college will be given on
days to correct violations

it was also noted that the
tire escapes oI several of the
women's dorms lead to en-
closed courtyards tram which
there is no escape, Presently,
only housemothers. Buildings
and Grounds employees and
some hall presidents have heys
to the loggia doors.

In 1945 a major tire of “un-
determined origin" swept
through i-iaines Hall basement
causing $5,000 damage, com-
pletely destroying three rooms
and damaging the rest ol the

need for greater communication

Faculty Curriculum Committee
Conducts In-Deplh Investigation

By Harold Fuson

The Faculty Committee on Educational Policy and Curriculum
has wasted no time since its formation four months ago. Charged
with the task of investigating and evaluating existing educational
policy and programs of the college, the committee has held seven
special Christmas vacation meetings in addition to its regular twice
weekly sessions and, according to Chairman Robert Haveman
(economics), hopes to have its recommendations ready tor faculty
action by the beginning or next semester.

The depth and range of the
committee‘s concerns were evi-
denced by the content of a ques-
tionnaire distributed to all stu<
dents late this week. The ques-
tionnaire sounds out student
opinion on areas ranging from
the role 0! the major field to
the advisability of interdiscipli-
nary seminars and new pro-
grams which focus on contem-
porary problems,

Haveman said the complexity
of the questionnaire was neces»
sitated by “the sincere interest
oi the committee in obtaining a
detailed speciﬁcation oi what
the concerns of the students
are."

Thompson Writes
’01un Sign’
Drug Statement

By Susan Fogg

In an interview after the re
lease of the Deans’ Office state-
ment on “Student Use of
Drugs,” Dean so Eugene Thomp-
son further clarified the college
position on the subject

Dean Thompson, who wrote
and researched the release,
said it was intended neither to
condemn nor condone drug us-
age but to serve as a “caution
Sign" {or students. The col-
lege's position, he Ieels, places
emphasis on the uncertainty and
limited knowledge of the eifects
of drugs on the individual.

Both Thompson and bean
Richard H. Winters stressed
that the-disciplinary aspects

See DRUGS on page 8

“The committee has ape
preached its task with a broad
View toward what an ideal lib-
eral arts curriculum should look
like,” Haveman said.

“Many oi the proposals being
considered by the committee
are both innovative and experb
mental," Haveman claims. He
emphasized that the thinking of
the committee is still highly
tentative. Yet he continued,
”We are considering proposals
which would substantially
change the direction or educa-
tional policy at the college."

“We have developed a strong
concern about the inability o!
liberal arts colleges in general
and Grinnell in particular to
come to terms with the con-
temporary w o rid,” Haveman
Said. He said the Committee
feels confident that movement
in this direction can take place
at Grinnell,

Among the areas the questiom
naire deals with is the adequacy
of the general requirements of
the college. There is concern
with the committee, Haveman
said, that these courses often
do not "whet the student’s ap-
petite. They iail to stimulate
students to take additional work
in these areas.”

Also on the committee’s mind
is the desirability of offering
academic credit for certain co<
curricular activities. Haveman
mentioned choir and orchestra
as well as additional activities
in the creative arts as possl.
bilities.

Tlle greatest danger ahead,
said Trip Kennedy, is one of
mounting frustration that stu»
dent ettorts attain no lasting
results. Kennedy believes this
hazard will increase it SGA
presses for immediate revision
of open rooms policy, at the
expense of other programs. He
i'eels that the administration
appears relatively less flexible
on this matter than on others.

A more productive approach,
he maintains, would entail a
“redistribution of SGA em-
phasis;” for instance, more at-
tention should be given to
curriculum planning and
course otterings.

Kennedy proposed that

Siimulu-s for Creativity-

There is some radical thinking going on in our midst. The
Faculty Committee on Educational Policy and Curriculum dares
this community to challenge its very foundations. The Committee is
saying that we must be concerned with "the inability of the liberal
arts college to come to terms with the contemporary world." The
Committee asks whether the academic environment at Grinnell —
pspecially present course requirements — produces an adverse
"disciplinary introversion.” To this we respond with an unqualiﬁed
yes, and hasten to add —— it is stifling.

For instance, how many exceptionally native people can Grin-
nell credit to its name. We knew one a few years ago who went on to
a top position in an experimental branch of the communications
field, but then he never graduated from Grinnell; he "dropped out.”
Originators at Grinnell — people with minds of their own who go
far independently — often do not succeed at Grinnell. The narrow
academic rigors force conformity. (It is interesting how, at Grinnell.
everyone looks, thinks and acts pretty much the same.)

The situation of student publications on campus is a case in
point. Those students motivated to contribute to the yearbook, to
Nous or to the 5&5 do so outside the system of acceptable credits
for graduation; thus, often at the expense of their college career.
The problem has wider ramifications to the college as a Whole.
Publications suffer in quality, few students elect to work on
them: they easily die out.

Where does the student at Grinnell find support for creative
energies? The art department offers no independent credit for non-
majors. Grinnell's English department used to offer writing sem-
inars in many literary forms; it does so no longer. We think
Grinnell‘s theater department is an exception, though, and indi-
cates a good trend for the rest of the campus to follow. Right now
one student is developing her ability at film-making under the
auspices of this department.

Grinnell needs to encourage the special abilities of more stu-
dents. Extracurricular activities (Le. student government work),
like any valuable learning process, also deserve credit. A commu-
nication arts department ~ including offerings in broadcasting,
photography and creative writing — should possibly replace the
present Englishrjournalism discipline. Further, the limitations on
independent credit should be dropped. independent study, being
the only study which will continue beyond our college years, act-
uaily deserves priority in our academic program. Grinnell should
be in the business of producing vital people. if it is, its students
will be immersed in the process of creative personal development
and Will be capable “of coming to terms with the contemporary
world." —K. .

Allin Endorsed —

A student government president’s perspective must be broad,
his judgment sophisticated. he must be capable of commanding
respect. We feel SGA candidate Craig Allin is well in tune with
student aims, best fulfills the criteria for mature leadership, and )5
prepared to carry on progressive and constructive government.

An introduction to the Modern Revolution

Cybernatioii: Topic of Broad Scone

By Arnold Adelberg
(Mathematics)

in light of the forthcoming Cybernetion Week—
end, it seems relevant to consider some of the
terms used and look at a few publications that
examine the subject from different vantage
points.

“Cybernetics" is a word coined by the mathe-
matician Norbert Wiener (in a book of the same
name published in 1948) to denote the science of
control and communication processes in both ani-
mals and machines. it is derived from the Greek
word for “steersman.” Cybernetics underlies all
systematic analyses of automation and com-
puters. The field deals with Such diverse sys-
tems as nerve networks in animals, electronic
computing machines, servo systems for automatic
control of machinery and other information proc-
essing systems. It overlaps the fields of neuro«
physiology. computing machines, information
theory and automation, and seeks to find common
features for these.

Just as the 15th century is commonly identi-
fied with the Industrial Revolution, in which men
harnessed machines to replace a considerable
amount of hand labor, the 20th century is often
called the time of Cybernetic Revolution. it is
also known as the second industrial Revolution
and is characterized by the use of machines to
control other machines. The burgeoning technol-
ogy of electronics has been instrumental to these
developments, and in particular, the electronic
computer has been an lndispensible aid.

The high degree of automation of many in.
dustries and the increasing automation of others
is apparent, as is the utilization of computers in
scientific research. In fact, as Daniel Bell, pro<
lessor of sociology at Columbia University, points
out in his book The Reforming of General Educas
tion, “The use of these new ‘intellectual technol-
ogies’ gives mathematics as a subject — and the
computer as a tool — an essential role in re-
search (in the social sciences as well as the name
Ial sciences) and a crucial place in the curricu-
lum. . r 4 All future work in social science will
require a high degree of mathematical training
and sophistication.”

A good introduction to the impact oi Cybernet-
ics on society, present and ruture, is a pamphlet
prepared for the Center for die Study of Demo~
cratic Institutions entitled Cybemaiion: The Si~
lent Conquest, by Donald N, Michael it is here
that the term “cybernalion” was invented. This
refers both to automation and Computers, the
former consisting of devices that automatically
perlorm sensing and motor tasks; the second, of
devices that perform routine or complex logical
and decisionmaking tasks with great speed. Cy-
bernetics is more commonly used to cover the
entire fieldI and in fact, the distinction between
the classes of devices disappears at the many
points where they converge,

The pamphlet explores the effects of Cyberna-
tion on “Employment and Unemployment," ‘ d—
ditional Leisure,” “Decisions and Public Op -
ion." lt Studies methods to control Cybemation,

which apparently creates as many problems til
it solves. it is far from optimistic about the ef-
fects of the eventual and lneluctable Cybernetic
takeover.

information is a paperback consisting of
articles from the September, 1966 issue of the
Scientific American devoted to the subject of in
formation theory. The book covers computer log-
ic, memory, input and output; systems analyses
and programming it discusses the use of com-
puters in science, technology, organization and
education. There are also chapters on "informa-
tion Storage and Retrieval,” and on “Artificial lu-
telligence." A bibliography is provided for more
detailed study of each area.

The Scientific American book is far more san-
guine about the effects of the new technology than
the Cybernation pamphlet. it is not concerned
with such problems as unemployment. or the cre-
ation of a new technological elite, but rather with
the manifold possibilities of electronic information
processing. Among the most striking is the possi-
bility of computers available to the general pub
lie at all times through telephone link-ups, pro-
viding instantaneous information and data proo-
essing.

Another possibility is the utilization of com-
puters in education. Thus, in an experimental pro-
gram at a California elementary school. an lBM
l500 computer is being used to teach mathematics
to first-graders. The point here is not one of eo-
richment, but rather of providing the student with
individual attention and a carefully controlled Way
for him to proceed at the pace best suited to his
needs. The results are remarkable, but of course
at this stage of development, formidably expen-
sive. (See the article “The Computer as Tutor” in
the Jan. 27 issue of Life Magazine.) Furthermore,
it seems clear that computers will not only be a
valuable tool in science, management, etc, but
will in many respects alter nur approaches to
these areas, as they redetermine what is possible
and what is not.

Finally, we have the intriguing possibilities of
the computer “selfreducation.” Basically the in-
formation processing done by electronic com-
puters consists of three operations — input by
which data is lead into the machine, internal
processing of the data, and output. These opera-
tions are of course not independent because the
kind of data processing that is dune and the out-
put are determined by the input. 0n the other
hand, there is a kind of feedback or self»correct-
ing feature whereby the computer — deciding on
a course of action # can refer to its oWn enors
mous memory plus the data available to it at any
given instant. This memory feature enables it to
learn from its past experience. it is conceivable
that the properly programmed computer will not
only perform the tasks assigned to it by its pro-
grammer, but also consider and solve problems
not envisioned by him.

The intent of this article has been to give some
indication of the scope of Cybernetics. *The pur-
pose of the coming Weekend is to provide an op-
portunity to learn more about the subject.

To The Editor:

The college community
should attend very closely to
the deans commentary on the
punitive consequences of mrrb
juana usage. As someone who
has gone through the agony of
being arrested and charged
with felonious possession of
marijuana, i can say trom ex.
perience that apprehension is
not only expensive and un-
pleasant, but also leads to pro.
found emotional problems of a
personal nature.

1937 which led to my unpleas-
ant experience with the law
was the result of misinforma-
iicn, vested interests, and hasty
judgment by the powers that
were. 1 feel an obligation to

Regardless or the ambiguity ct
this statement, there is an ex-
tremely large amount or evi-
dence which indicates that
marijuana usage is not addict
ing (1, 2, a, 4, 5, 7), and does
not tend to lead to the usage
of dangerous drugs which are
themselves addicting (1, 5, 6,
7); only a few of these sources
are tootnuted. it should be
noted that when such infre-
quent progressions occur, they
usually take place in lower so-
cioeconomic strata, where in-
dividuals obtain mariiunna

After the FaI:

By John Wiles

The ﬁrst non-professional American produc«
tion of Arthur Miller’s After the Fall -~ a play
which “rellects the climate in all Our Souls" —
will he presented on campus this coming week-
end by the Theatre Department. The play, to be
staged Febi 22-25 in Roberts Theatre, is under the
direction of Richard D. Meyer (speech and
theatre) and student director Melinda Ward.

After Ihe Fall is, in Meyer's estimation, one
01 the decidedly “important” Works of contem-
porary American drama — although at the same

time one which ”very probably cannot be judged
within our generation" due to its own complexi-
ties and to the considerable aura of controversy
which has surrounded and, in Meyer’s opinion,
confused its reception by the American public.

Aiter the Fall, Meyer said, "reflects the two
states modern man finds himseli in now — the
shedding of Puritanism and the subsequent lack
of something to fill this internal gap.” The re
sultant onnmic question “who am 1?" character-
lzes, in Meyer’s opinion, the play’s pervasive
appeals: that oi the universal human crisis oi
identity, and that or the topical personal rele-
vance with which Miller, through Quentin, hi:
protagonist. can be seen to be “speaking to con-
temporary man . i . in contemporary terms"

The significance oi the play. Meyer said, il
manifest first, in its portrayal oi the universal
dilemma oi “a mature person who has stopped
‘becoming' " and, having reached a "rock bot-
tom" oi coniused guilt and irustratlon, ilnds that
he merely “Is" and that somehow must Iubseo
quantly resolve his liie, in his own mind; Ind
lecondly, in the perceptive representation nod
critical nnalysir oi the conditions and conﬂicts

movie stars, HUAC investigations, sex symbols,
etc.

The play's obvious characterization of the per»
sonality and psyche of Marilyn Monroe has be-
come the most well-known and, no doubt, the
most distracting element oi the play. Meyer esti-
mates, however, that once this aspect of the
play is accorded its proper dramatic and histori-
cal perspective, this characterization will also
come to be appreciated as one oi the most bril-
liant and meaningful symbols through which Mil-

,ler communicates his themes oi personal crisis

and contemporary human values and existence

Meyer’s judgment of the longtenn value poi
Atter the Fall is that the play’s extensive psycho-
logical complexities and development will insure
it a lasting appeal not unlike that oi Shake-
speare’s Hamlet. Meyer's personal reﬂection is
that “there is no question that there is more
character interior in this play than in any other
play i know oi."

Meyer’s intense interest in the play has re-
sulted primarily from the experience at his 1963-
84 sabbatical leave from Grinneil, during which
time he was employed at the newly-organized
Lincoln Center Repertory Theatre in New Yorii
as assistant to Elia Kazan, director of the origi-
nal New York production oi After the Fall. A:
directorial assistant, Meyer was intimately in-
volved in months oi evolution as the play pre-
pared ior production, as well as being a close
witness to Miller's own careful revising and
adapting oi the play

Mayor is anticipating markedly varied l'eHC‘
illons irom the audience oi the upcoming Grinnell
roduotiom in his estimation. the student-aged

rtlon oi the audience will be more likely to
irkw tho play primarily in appreciation of tho
Ilementl oi universality which, in Meyer's mind.
promise to make the play one oi lasting intense.

The Committee Is vitally con-

whether this kind of speciali-

a possibility the committee will
recommend an experimental

Haveman said.

Avison Addresses Senaie.
Ouilines Expansion Program

Mr. James Avlson. head of
the Development Oltice, spoke
to the senate Wednesday night
about the college's ten year,
$25 million expansion program.
Oi the $12 million to he raised
In the next live years. he said
$5.8 million is earmarked lor
academic use. such as expan-
sion of the library and higher
faculty salaries. The rest will
he used for capital expansion,
such as the proposed 32 million
P. E. complex.

"The money tor P. E." Avison
emphasized, ”is not being taken
away irom other needs like
classroom buildings. 1 see no
reason that there will he a
change in emphasis at Grin-
mail because of the new P. E.
complex."

To raise the money, Avison
said, the alumni will have to
be reorganized, and the college
will have to relate to the alum-
ni in different ways. He said
a new and more “intellectu-
ally” oriented alumni magazine
will be published. He also men
tioned plans tor a three day con—
vocation next fall during home-
coming which will bring to
Grinnell speakers or national
reputation. Martin Luther King
and Clark Kerr have been in-
vited.

Speaking on the “oonrmunr
cation gap” between the stu-
dents and administration, Avi-
son said any such gap “is cer-
tainly not intended.” “We want
10 relate to you,” he said. “but
most or us—the Burling gang
—do not know how to do it.”

Avison said student demon-
strations have “little eiiect” an
ioundatiun grants but that they
“hurt" lund»raising among oldv
er alumni. “They don’t under-
stand (demonstrations)," Avi-
son said, speaking or older
alumni, "but they have to learn
to live with it.”

Reierring to the criticism of
the P. E. complex, he said, “I
have to learn to live with the
5&3.“

in Executive Cabinet reports,
Karen Lauterbach introduced an
AWS Board recommendation
“that the senate establish a
committee to investigate the
possibility of the college estab-
lishing a contractual agreement
with incoming students regard-
ing tuition and-or tuition in-
creases. We would like to raise
some questions.” The senate
established the committee.

Miss Lauterbach also said
AWS Board meetings are open
ior those interested. The board

Steve Kent said President
Leggett should announce a de-
cision regarding the hours pro-
posal sometime before or im-
mediately alter spring vacation.
Kent also expressed the hope
that other members oi the ad-
ministration and faculty, par-
ticularly Mr. l-laveman, chair-
man or the education policy
committee, would “be ready
soon" to speak to the senate
on campus issues.

Comment on Kirkpatrick

By Jeri Dunn

Having dedicated his liie to
dispelling the notion that the
harpsichord is an Interior pre-
decessor to the piano, Mr. Ralph
Kirkpatrick communicated his
own kind of fervor in his per-
iormance Saturday In Roberts.
Judging from the reaction to
his performance. as well as the
overflow attendance, he suc-
ceeded rather well In his goal.
Kirkpatrick demonstrated that
the harpsichord has been an in-
strument oi nuance by including
in his program a wide range
or early composers and styles
ranging from the technical dit-
iiculties oi Handel and Rameau
to the satire of Couperin and
the sobriety or Back.

The Couperin 0nzienne more
was oi particular Interest. As
Kirkpatrick explained belore
hand, Couperin wrote a series
of musical jibes at former
mistresses and, lucongruously,
the power-hungry Muslclans'
Guild. The latter organization
was routed at the end at the
the Gram by "drunkards, mon-
keys, and bears.”

Kirkpatrick won many new
adherents by substituting Bach’s
ltalian Concerto (for “acousti-
cal" reasons) in place at Scar-
latti. it was disappointing that
the composer best interpreted
by Kirkpatrick had to be shown
the door, for Scarlatti was 81-
must twentieth century in his
disregard of the musical status

quo. The only glimpse Grin-
nell got oi him was a single err
core.

Kirkpatrick’s technical virtu-
osity followed a classical slyll
oilingering.

It is almost impossible to
criticize Kirkpatrick‘o musical
interpretation. After receiving
his BA. at Harvard, he iraver
ed to Paris on a grant from
his alma mater to study tech-
nique under Landowska and
theory under Boulanger (whose
many iamous pupils included
Gershwin and Copland). Kirk-
patrick’s painstaking research
on trills (ﬁnanced by a Gug-
genheim Fellowship) and his
book on Scarlatti are considered
deiinitive.

Ric MaeDowell

For Ric MacDowell, the in»
mediate challenge is to iron
ou’t this year’s changes through
a shared response of all three
branches of the Grinnell com-
munity. This endeavor must
overcome the distance between
generations. a “gap of ideals
and aspirations."

Social life should be nourish-
ed through individual respect:
we should not passively accept
the "superimposed mold of
personality to which students
are shaped.” Therefore coun~
selors must be freed from rule
enforcement, while the role of
the South Campus head resi-
dent advisers is to be constant-
1y evaluated.

Turning to academic proh-
lenls, MacDowell directed at-
tention to the efforts of large
classes. The reversal of this
trend should provide one of
many discussion topics for stu»
dents who would meet regu-
larly with the curriculum
committee.

Further educational propo-
sals include SGA application
for foundation grants —— a
measure which MacDowell be-
lieves would strengthen In
tcrim or make possible a sec-
ond Encampment, He adds,
work for distinction should is
extended into the sophomore
year, to bridge the gap be-
tween freshman honors and up-
pcrclass independent scholar-
ship. Furthermore, the publica-
tiuns program could be en-
hanced by awarding academic
credit to student editors.

of the problem affect primarily
those students who are involved
in the distribution of drugS, Stu<
dents whose use of drugs is a
personal difficulty would more
likely be dealt with through
"counseling and orherrs
sources."

Misuse of drugs was defined
as use of drugs illegally in
a way that causes severe per-
sonal problems or that results
in large scale distribution, Both
the deans expressed an interest
in handling the problem within
the structure of the college
rather than by involving out-
slde legal authorities.

Dean Thompson qualified the
statement that the use of marl-
juand can lead to addiction,
saying that the distortion of
“time and space preception”
and the loss of inhibitions would
be the Chief causative factors.

lease, originated from The u-

Hoopsters Reap Usual Luck

By Barry Anconl

The Pioneer basketball team
ventured to Mount Vernon, Iowa,
Saturday night, where the Cor-
nell Rams presented them with
their twentyrsecond consecutlve
defeat, 94—72,

Grinnell was outshot and nut-
rebounded, and featured a slow
offense and confused defense.
A few bad calls on both teams
added spice to a rather dull
defeat,

The treat of the evening was
provided by Bob Watt, who was
otherwise 5 c or e l e s s in the
game. Bob, in a successful ef-
fort to keep the ball in bounds,
went sprawling backwards in-
to the Cornell bench, tipping
it over, and sending the less
nimble Rams toppling into the
front row of spectators,

Other excitement was pro-
vided by “Gunner Dick” Musser,
who fired in eight points in
that final part of many Grin-
nell games reserved for the
scrubs. Helping in the melee
of the final minutes were Greg
Rankin, who blasted out two

Schreless but sweating alter the
