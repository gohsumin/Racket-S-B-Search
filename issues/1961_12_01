Open-Open Dorms ._

Tile Social Coordinating committee is to be commend,
ed for its recent recommendations to extend open-open
dorms to Friday nights ill addition to Sundays (see story
13, 1). The present system has set a successful precedent.
Openeopen dorms have given students a chance to talk priv-
ately with one another or stlldy, undisturbed by the blare at
TV sets or the pounding of self-made pianists. Yet men and
\vomen lnay enjoy a coinfort which tlle several dentist’s
waiting rooms without doors on the union’s second floor

could not pl'ossibly provide.
It seems obvious to most

people that those who intend

to play Doll Juan and tre")ass the delicately drau'n lilies
or" conventional morality, will undoubtedly find a place to
satisfy their inclinations regardless of openropen dorms.

The Shelter Problem

In light of the new plans for a Grinnell fallout shelter

and the nation-Wide colltrovel‘s

' over the issues involved,

the suggestion of a Grinnell student government official
may be a thoughful one. It would seem advantageous for
G innell, a respected educational institution, to show a cone
scientious public interest in various sides of the problem
before declaring itsell’ a leader in a highly questionable

enterprise.

A conference and series of diszllssions by outside ex-
parts on both sides of the shelter fence might lead to a
greater clarification of, or Various alteniatives to. the pre-

sent solution.

If nothing else, such a series of discussions involving
administration, faculty, students alid various respectable

authorities would show that Grinnell is carefull

lnves lg" t-

ing the problems involved rather than making a hasty

“digging in” for which it could later be severely critic

ted.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Writers

To the Editor:

It is very difficult to bring
any solid principles to bear on
the matter or a college [allrout

clear conclusions,

Onc reads that the Pra'dent
of the United States consider it
most reprehensible, almost clini-
inally so, for citizens and com-
munities to fail to provide
themselves such shelters, And
one can appreciate the sense or
community responsibility winch
the college administration lecls
for the students enrolled here.

Yet questions about what
program to pursue and the
lensibility or the presently pro-
posed one Suggest themselves:

(1) In the light or conflicting
scientific opinions about fallvout

the geography of possible missilc
attack, how can any defense pro»

Docs onc protect ior two hours.
two days, two wccks or two
months and against what blast
force or radiation inlcnsily7

(2) What is the goal of such
pr sumed protection? Avoidance
of a tempor’drv ham-d. or plcir
oration for civilizations renewal
in a completely desolatcd land7
The two would require quite dire
rel-ent measures.

(3) What is to be the extent or
such protection? At the moment
it is assumed lo bc the resident
student body, and the Atom take
the professor and townspeoplc
if they haven‘t resources enough
to build their own privolo shel~
ters Perhaps the college would
do bctlcr without proicssois.

(4) Are the present facilities
really adequate to the job pro—
posed for them" Ii they are not,
then should bigger and better
ones be built—though ruinous
financially for ,the college? But
it not the whole \vav. complete-

timate perils for everyone con-
cerned, why anything at all;
a situation in which the undone
contradicts the purpose or what
is douc‘?

(5) But lvhal will be the effect
or a concentration upon shelter
building? Will it lead lo a resigr
nation to the prospects of an
atomic war. strengthening the
hands of those in the military
that prefer to strike first in pres
venlive holocaust; or to the re-
jection of all other efforls to tire
vent such \i'ar? Will it subtly
orient all thought and endeavor
to an underground psychology?
And who is interested in that

To the Editor:

The case against Civil Defense
rests on two related points
which tend to demonstrate that
the disadvantages of such a pro
gram far outweigh its advant-
aces

ll A nuclear war would be a
worldwide disaster. Even the
military experts who hold the
position [hat we can win a nu-
clear war concede that we can do
it only with an unprecedented
loss cl life and probable pollu—
tlon of the atmosphere. Moi-c
pessimistic experts project the
end or civilization.

2) The Civil Defense pr gram
is dangerous in that it builds a
two~sldcd stole of mind that
moves us closer to the war. lne
tornatlonally, it increases the
tension and suspicion which act
as blocks to effective negotiation.
Domestically, it provides us with
an acceptance cl the eventuality
or war. and a creeping complac-
ency as to its nature.

This is hnrdly n clear-cut
issue. and the decision collrcrnr
ing our fallout shelter must
necessarily involve a ccrtnin
nmoiinl of faith. If we deride
to co-opernte with Civil De»
icuse. we will place our inith
in the doctrine that we r.- n

survive and win a nuclear war,
and that the time has come lor
prepmntion.

To the Editor:

Paul Courtright‘s cartoon in
the last issue oi the Scarlet mid
Black can not justifiably he cons
demncd a misrepresentation
or the VVaslilnglon group. It had
nothing to do with the group
as such. but rather, was an air

If we are to condemn Court

of lhe larger issues involved,

Ken Schill

To the Editor:

As I understand 1he substance
of Jim Glenn‘s rcccnl letter.
after d tilling it from its new
iuvect c, it seems that the
message concerned a group of
pselldoantellcctuals who were
able lo pi-oicct their ideas on
an apathetic campus by unscru-
pulmls means. Menlion was also
made of [hair putative position
as “God's chosen people."

Having come to the conclusion
that ll'lIS was not an anlleelnitr
ic attack, since the lcodcrs of
the executiverlegislallve complex
are members in good standing or
the Aryan race, I am writing to
agree with Mi Glenn: the word
ing of the r. lulion was me
fortunate

A poini that Mr, Glenn. cer-
tainly out of ignorance mid not
out or mahciousncss. neglected
to mention is the admmi ra-
lion’s realization of its crior
and subsequent nlllliﬁcation of
the referendum.

The administration's honest
admission or :In error and its
attempt to correct that error.
1 think, is admirable.

Certainly, the ability of pseu-
do-mlcllecluols lo proiccl their
ideas on an “apathetic" campus
is not the fault of the ioriner
but the doloult of the latter. i

To the Editor:

1 was singularly impressed rc—
ccutly with John Ward's last
piece in the Scarlet and Black.
Not only was it narrowmiinded,
but it was completely useless
and unnecessary. Every week I
open up the 53:3 to page two
only to be greeted with the
countenance of John Ward and
his column at lnanc nothings
completely unbecoming a par
per of the stature of the
Seas,

From Mr. Ward‘s column,I
gather that he is for every mi-
nority and splinter group on
campus and that the majority is
uninformed and disinterested. I
respectfully submit that some of
Mr Ward‘s stones are rattling
around in his head. The space der
voted to his Ihoughts could be
better utilized by being left
blank so that each student could
write his own column in his own
paper.

Somehow, Mr. Ward’s pseudo-
intellectual wit leaves me cold,
Undoubtedly Mr. Ward could
lainbast me as uninlormed and
disinterested. but i believe 1 am
in the majority in this case.

if Mr. Ward wniits the school
to go on a hunger strike Sup-
porting the Grinnell Students
in Peace I suggest that he skip

1,125 consecutive meals oi his
own and sit on a flag pole to
register his support while I,
with lull stoninvh, go mv disin-
(crested and uniiilormed way.

I think that this campus is
holding a slnall minority in too
much reverence This group is
the much touted and much shout
ed Grinnell Students for Peace.
Never let it be forgotten that
they are in the minority and
they are heard only because this
paper denotes lar too much space
to this dissident minority fac-
tion and not a proportionate
amount of space, to the majority
opinion. _

Undoubtedly this letter will
be the object of much ridicule
and scorn on this campus and
will be picketed by the Grinnell
Students lor Peace, but those
are the facts,

But I must content myself
with this liille outburst and
swallow my pride and my passion
as in each succeeding week I
rind Mr. Ward's face wasting
space in the paper lo which i
subscribe and read for the news

To the Editor:

The idea of the dignity and
power or man, which gave
man the strength and courage
tor the tremendous aecom~
plisliments oi the last ieiv
centuries, is challenged by the
suggestion that we have to rc-
vcrt to the acceptance or
man’s ultimate powerlessness
and insigniﬁcancc. This idea-
threatens to destroy the very
roots from which our culture
grew.

Erich Fromm, “Mal-l tor Him-
seli."

The challenge that Fromm
refers to in the above passage
is no longer a mere suggestion,
Man, today, is being threatened
and bullied into accepting his
“u ate powerlessness and in-
significance." He is being com~
pcllcd to sacrifice his values. his
judgment and his reason to the
realistic fact that with a push
of a button he can be obliterat—
ed. The question being ‘forcsd
into mans thinking today is not
of the survival ot truth or vir-
tue, but of survival.

The Grinnell campus continu—
ally feels the crlccts of this
world pressure. Currently this
has been displayed in the issues
of disarmament, nuclear testing
and, most recently, the proposed
fallsout shelter. It is not my in.
tention to discuss the pros and
cons of these issues, but rather
to examine the campus reaction
to this challenge to mall’s dig.
nity.

It is true that many have
voiced their stand on these
issues, both locally and natiolie
ally. Resolutions and i-cteren-
dums have sounded out opilh
ions. Support has been lent
both through iasting and fi-
nancial aid, Then, does not
this speak for itself? Is not
this enough? Have we not re-
acted in such a way as to
credit man's dignity?

To a great extent, yes; how-
cver, perhaps ‘to a greater ex-

To the Editor:

On Monday evening, Nov. 6,
West Norris hall had a serious
discussion concerning the Stu.
dent Senate resolution on nu-
clear testing. After an hour this
discussion was cut short because
our senators had to go to the
Student Senate meeting and be»
cause a large number of our
members were scheduled to play
volleyball at 3:15.

Arriving 16 minutes late, one
minute past the 15smintlte pe—
riod of grace, our teams were

,told that they had lost 6 games
with East Norris by default, A
protest was lodged with the 1M
Beard and was deleated

The loss of the 5 games is
relatively of little importance,
What concerns us is the seems
ing lack ot perspective of some
of the members ot the 1M board.

tent, no. Too olten l have ioundl
the opinions bring Cxpl'

cd by the same productive lcw,l
For every one student who is
genuinely concerned, it seems,

so described, But, you say, how‘
can 1 say this in view or the
great numbers participating in
the last and thc r-etercnduin,l
thﬂ
seemed quite unaware of what‘
they were actually doing.

Many who xprcssed a stand
on dincrcnt i-ues
quainted with the facts of those
issues, or even of the implicas
tions or their stand. This was
particularly true of many who,

voted in the referendum.

Again, many who participatcd‘

following their own dictates, but
rather those of friends who on
couragcd them to join. But per
haps most noticeable of all are
those who are simply content to
sit back and criticize, joke, make
sarcastic remarks, or simply be
indiderent. These especially rep—
resent what Fromm was con—
ccriicd about. 1
i

All those cases in the above 3
paragraph are to some extent ,
beginning to how to the threat
oi our age: that man is power-
less and purposclcss. Their 1
stands are more verbal than
personal. Their inlormation is
more guess-work than iact- ,
work. Their interests depend ,
too much on the voices dietat- ,

illg those interests. l

And this is what the voices ot
nuclear destruction would want‘
man to bC—one who slowly‘
loses taith in stands and cone
victions. One who iealizcs the
realistic probability of Cataclysm‘
and problems of s ival. One‘
who can, smiling, sit back ill‘
oblivious serenity, and stare at'
the “Home, Sweet Home” plaque
on his iall~out shelter Wall. l

l
This is not to say that we do
not favor the 1M program or,
the generally ﬁne administration
of the pl‘ugram. However, we-
purport that practical experience
in democratic procedure, serious
discussion on matters oi national
and international importance,
and a real sense or participation
in the a airs or our country are
of more importance in a liberal
education than a recreation prev

gram.
We feel that all OI those [2017
loge experiences can and should

Exist, but i[ the former should
occasionally encroach on lhe lat-

ter, the latter should yield. This,
of course, is El matter of uplns

ion. We hope it is the opinion
at the overwhelming majority or
students at Grinncll.

This is lndeed a year of ci' '
when the UN faces grave chale
lenges which threaten its very
existence. The problems before
it range from the self-determ—
ination ol member nations to
possible bankruptcy.

During the weekend we heard
some of the most pressing and
difficult issues discussed: the
new African nations, the reoi»
ganization of the Secretariat.
bankruptcy, the representation
of China. the neutral nations, and
disarmament

In discussing the emerging and
developing nations of Africa. Dr.
Rufus Clement. President of
Howard University. described
that continent's main needs as
education, capital. medicine,
food, national unity and physical
stability.

It was also said that those
viewing African neutralism as
important in world aifairs
must beer in mind the discrep-
ancy between her weakness in
military strength and capital
and the position she now must
take in the world community.

sophomores and two fine sen—
ior guards, form the basis or a
creditable squad.

Bob Musser and Ray Horton.
senior forwards, are co-caplalns.
Musser has been Grinnell‘s lead—
ing scorer the past two seasons,
and Horton's rebounding and
steadying influence were an ime
port-ant iaetor in last year's suc~
eess.

Guards Bill Parsons, George
Gray and Ron Sandler are the
other senior representatives. Par-
sons, a letterman two years ago,
spent last season in Poland

Gray, n transier student, will

be seeing his first action as a
Pioneer and is being counted
on as one of the tnam’s lead
ing scorers, Sandier was with
the squad brieiiy last year and
is slated to see more duty this
time around.

Junior players include letters

Big men Rogerson and Asby
will do a large portion of the
board work. Shepherd, a 196!)
transfer student, and newcomer
Bramson will provide additional
backeourt help.

Sophomores Jim Mifilln, John
Sundell, Marty Jacobson and
Jack Griffin round out the team.
Sundeil, at 6’7" the tallest man,
will play a lot at center. leflin,
possessor of a fine jump shot, will1
be in the running for a starting
berth at forward. Griffin givesi
valuable depth at iorward, while
Jacobson's flashy guard play will
get him some action,

Coach John Ptitsch has an
air of cautious optimism about
the team’s chances, In the pre- l,
season poll taken oi the Midr l
