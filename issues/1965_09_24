. Encampment Topics Included

Liberal Education to iotin! Lite

Sixty students, faculty, and administration members
spent two days last weekend dodging the rain, playing bridge,
participating ill a ”College Bowl” contest, getting to know each
other in a non»acadenlic way, and — more in line with the pre-
announced purpose of the encampment — discussing the col-

lege and its problems.

Participants in the encampment arrived at_the Episcopal
camp near Boone Friday night and began five discussion

groups, which were concerned with topics from the social at-
mosphere at Grinnell to the nature of a liberal education,

On Saturday morning, President Glenn Leggett nloder<
ated a general session of all encampers, Dr. Leggett noted
that college students don’t face the fact that they are in a self-
regulating society and are consequently too tolerant of things

that might upset that society.

“Colleges have to let people make mistakes, but they
can’t allow the students to get away with mistakes day after

day,” Dr. Leggett said.

Dr. Leggett continued that the students don’t realize “how

Civil Rights Group Plans Study,
Lectures, Des Moines Prb/ects

In the nonhrganizational atmos
phere of the South Lounge, the
Grinnell civil Rights Group held,
what president Karen olson
termed, a “basically organization.
a1 type meeting” designed to ac-
quaint students with the group’s
planned activities for the year and
with the student exchange prde
gram with LeMoyne College in
Memphis, Tenn.

The group will concentrate its
activites in three ﬁelds. First, a
number of study groups of {our
to six people will be formed to
research social problems. Not lim-
ited to civil rights concerns, some
suggested fields ior investigation
included migrant labor, Indian
problems, the legacy oi Recon-
struction, prison treatment, and
the enforcement of Iowa Civil
rights laws.

Each group will have a laculty
member or knowledgeable per.
son as a sponsor. When the group
has completed its study, its tind-
ings will be presented during cot-
tee hours or dinner discussions:

Second, a limited number oi Iec~
turesAtwo or three at most—with
th most prominent leaders of the
civil rights movement—Martin
Luther King, c. T. Vivian, James
Farmer, Hosea Williams and Roy
Wilkins were mentioned—are
planned but have reached only the
idea stage. Karen Olson didn’t
rule out the possibility of invit-
ing a member of the Ku Klux
Klan to the campus “to stir up
a little controversy on campus,”
as she put it

Third, in addition to the Le-
Moyne College student exchange
program, which no Grinnell stu-
dent took advantage or this se-
mester, a slum project in Des

Educare’s First Meeting Attracts 50,
Winters Speaks About Student Apathy

In the initial meeting or Edu~
care, the new Grinnell College ed-
ucation association, Associate
Dean Richard H. Winters spoke to
a group or so students and taculty
members about the apathy of to
day's college students.

Winters blamed the present lack
of enthusiasm on outside pres-
sures.

“This is a generation of tested
and measured students. They are
too concerned with grades. But it
there were no grades, how could
a student’s comparative standing
with other students in the college,
or even in the nation, be mea-
sured?”

Winters went on to say that he
had never heard ot a completely
uniﬁed college except tor "cer-
tain seasons and sports."

"There can be no unity or spirit
or interest. There is usually a nu-
cleus for diversified interests.
Each student must find an area
with which he can identify," Win-
ters stated.

“The college community is a
corporate body. Within and be-
yond one's scli,

The students have to create their

Answering a suggestion that the
students need guides for behavior,
Dr. Leggett said, ”Maybe you

Grinnell Women's Behavior on For
With Freeman's National Findings

By BOB HODIERNE

As a iooruote to last week's story on the sex survey on Grinuell
campus, the 5&8 offers the results of a nationwide survey mm the same
topic.

Marvin B. Freeman, assistant dealt of undergraduate education
and research associate at the Institute for the Study oi Human Prob-
lems at Stanford University, conducted a survey from which he COHv
cluded that sexual permissiveness has not swept the American college
campus.

Among his findings was the discovery that threertourths of unmar.

Tied College women are virgins. The survey taken on the Grinnelt cam-i

pus last spring, a survey which was part of a sociology independent
project, found that 77 per cent of thnnell women were virgins.
Another finding in Freeman's survey which comcided with the Grin<
nell survey was the fact that premarital intercourse among college
women is usually restricted to their future husbands.
Freeman said, “It is probable that the incidence of non—virginity
unong college women has increased , . . little since the 1930‘s."

Freeman went on to say that it may be that American college stu-
dents have evolved patterns of sexual behavior that will remain stable
for some time to come. The behavior consists of petting, intercourse
among engaged Couples, and early marriage."

Freeman concluded that virginity, as an abstract value, has little
meaning to women students. Premarital intercourse is shunned by the
great majority for personal or interpersonal reasons, according to
Freeman.

The reasons that Freeman said the coeds listed for not engaging
in intercourse diiiered somewhat irom the reasons given by Grinnell
women.

Freeman said that fear oi pregnancy, feelings of guilt, emotional
upset or loss of self~respect, and ”lack of certainty about the perma-
nence of relationships" were the reasons given by most college women
for not engaging in sexual intercourse.

The Grinnell survey said that the reasons given by Grinnell women
for not.having sexual intercourse were tear of pregnancy, lack of op»
portunity, lack of an appropriate setting and uncertainty about attitudes.

 

Encampmen’r. Coniinued

Last weekend‘s encampment was designed to bring
selected students and faculty into contact on a non-aca-
demic level. In this respect, the encampment. was a big
success.

Each year, however, the planners of the encamp—
ment are faced with “bringing the spirit of Encamp-
ment back to Grinnell."

This year’s encampment committee, headed by
Karen Lauterbach, is planning to keep the encamp—
ment going on the Grinnell campus.

Coffeehours with discussion group participants
hopefully will be held throughout the semester.

Re~meetings of the original discussion groups may'

allow them to come up with workable ideas instead of
off-the-top-of»the-head suggestions.

The final reports of the five groups should provide
a solid base for general discussion.

And it would seem that the non~encampers of the
Grinnell community would have some interest in seeing
that the $600 spent. to provide a pleasant atmosphere
for 60 persons for two days was well used.

And Then The Letters Came...

Eldridge . . .

To the Editor:

“Sexual Behavior of American
College Women," published in the
Merrillel’almer Quarterly, January
1965 by M. B. Freeman concludes
that there has been little shift in
the sexual behavior oi college ii
men in the past so years: “the pi
portion of non-virgins among Cole
lege females has remained relative
ly constant . . , College women
change tho‘ attitudes towards
sexuality during the college years
generally in a more liberal direc-
tion. The code of behavior they
end with, however, is a relatively
conservative one tor themselves.
but a tolerant one for others.”
Thus a real researcher shows that
Gael Greene (Sex and the College
Girl) doals more in impressionism
than fact. He also provides us
with some perspective on our
own “23 per Cent.”

Not all promiscuous people incur
subsequent traumas. but i great
majority do, less because they feel
that they have violated a moral
rule than because they realize that
their promiscuity was an indica-
tion or an egocentric condition of
character. The bipolar egocentrici-
ty of two people is no less debili»
tating than that of one; mutuality
of consent is not a saving gracel
But ersons with a spotless past
who arshly judge and disdain the
23 per cent display their own varie-
ty of egocentricity, which is one
reason why l think more tolerance
in this area is a good thing. We
need to remember the “throwing
the first stone" parable, An egocen
trio condition of Character seems
to me to be the basic problem and
it may or may not correlate with
sex practices. This is why a lot of
the discussion of Grinnell’s 23 per
cent which I have heard the last
few days seems superficial.

of the “Grinnell Kinseyrlike sur-

that Grinnell women will be a.

'SDS-Type Program' Leader
Interprets Group's Purpose

To the Editor:
As one of the lustigators of last
Wednesday's socalled SDS meet
ing, i would like to amend the
view presented in the pages of this
newspaper. First and foremost. the
meeting was not an SDS meeting;
it was rather the second meeting of
an unaffiliated group interested in
civil rights and SDSrtype programs,
several of whose members have
worked for SDS. The purpose of
this meeting was neither to or-
ganize an SDS chapter nor to make
any kind of policy statement, but
rather to talk to Billy King, a visit.
ing SDS worker, and to throw a»
round some ideas about possible
projects. We were neither ex ect-
ing nor prepared to say anyt iu
delinite to the large number 0
students (much less the press) who
suddenly appeared. All this is not
to say that we are not most happy
to have attracted the interest of a
large number of students. or that

we are not most happy to have
been given trout page coverage in
the 5&3, but rather to reassure
those who might have been disap-
pointed by Ihe meetings lock of
organization and program. Natur-
ally we hope that increasing hum.
bets of students (and faculty) will
sllow an interest in the type ol
concern and commitment which
originally brought our group to-
gether, and, indeed, the arousing
of such interest is one of the goals
of the group. Perhaps if such meet»
ings and issues as these continue
to make the front page of the sail:
soniethiii can be done to raise the
level of iscussion on this campus
from the amazing low point of re-
cent years. Certainly any article on
SDS, however misconstrued, is bet-
ter than the insipid and asilline
drivel of last year's “sad fresh»
man” and “youthful upperclass-

Gilmour, Iowa Anti-Poverty Director,
Cites Conservative Appeal of Program

The director of the Iowa “War
on Poverty” has described that
program as “tailormade tor the
Conservatives of Iowa."

Dr. C. Edwin Gilmour (political
science), who has mken a year's
leave of absence to become “Di-
rector of the Otﬁce of Economic
Opportunity" in Des Moines. re
turned to Grinnell last Friday to
speak before a meeting of the
League of Woman Voters.

Gllmolll‘ said that the new anti—
poverty program was made [or
conservatives “politically because
it is decentralized and ecomlnica -
ly because it insists on iull Value
lor every dollar sperm"

l-le blamed the communications
media for creating the misunder»
standing that the program was
“just another Federal program
with hordes of employees and
ridden with politics." The Des
Molnes Register in particular was
guilty at "soclally irresponsible
reporting and lack of perspective"
in its coverage of the program in
lowa, Gilmour added.

He then reviewed the need for
the program nationally and the
progress already made in Powe-
sheik county. Gilmour sulnmarizs
ed the “War on Poverty” as “the
most promising smial prsgram of
our lifetime."

Mad/ta,

by harlequin

The theatre is composed of
many parts—all equally impor-
tant—but some are less apparent
than others to the audience. Make-
up is generally one of these hidden
arts. The artists who pmVlde the
faces for the actors seldom a-
chieve a recognition beyond the
theatre arts world.

Make-up originated in the prim.
itive ritual, with magic symbolism
at prime importance. The mask
and decorated body were used to
irighten devils, invoke the gods,
or represent natural forces. In ad-
dition, the primitive wished to
conceal his identity, which might
affect the magic. The grotesque
symbolism became more refined
as society became more complex;
the Greeks and Chinese reduced
it to a disguised representation of
conventional characters. Through
the ages, these conventions
changed in form, but remained

purely representative. it was not
until fairly recent timeSAfrom the
Elizabethan period that make-up
became more realistic. By the end
of the nineteenth century, efforts
were being made to be historically
authentic.

Today, with tlle brilliance and
clarity of modern theatre light»
ing and the many possible visual
eilccts, make-up has become a
complex art. Lighting effects tend
to wash out the actor‘s skin color
and distort the shadows and
planes of this face. When expertly
applied, makeup counters this
through the use or coloring—
known as the base—and lining.

Besides merely restoring an act-
or's face to him, makeup can help
him look more the part from
changing his race to adding more
emotional value. (Malevolent
characters must look evil.)

The make-up artist must be
equally creative and industrious.
Tanya Hovanessian, head of this
year's makeup department, has
had both the practice and the
training that have made her as
fine as she is. We at Grinnell
have seen her art in the past,
and I am Sure we can look for
ward to another year or her mas-
tery enhancing the plays. She also
has never been loath to teaching
newcomers the art of make-up.

Trip Through the ‘Land of Smiles'
Brings Thai (harm to Grinnellian

Ed. Note: The l‘ollowlng ls
another letter from a Fifth Year
Abroad student in Thailand. This
letter is from leija Dedavas.

Settling myself in my seat, I
closed my eyes. I felt hot and
tired after my short and unnerv»
ing ride through the crowded city
streets. it is always a miracle to
escape the onslaught of traffic
here. Yes, i was anxious to get
back to the peace and quiet
which 1 had left more than three
weeks before. The fan whirled
overhead but barely made a stir
in the still oppressive Bangkok
heat. I turned my head and gazed
out the window at the hurrying
crowd of people. Thai women in
multi - colored p a s i n s (native
skirts), carrying their baskets,
bundles and sleeping babies,
brighceyed c h i in ren, Buddhist
priests, Chinese students, families
of Malayan ancestry—all moved
through the compartments and
sought their seats. i could hear the
ceaseless honking oI taxis and
other city sounds and smell the
various odors so characteristic of
this Oriental city. Then, with a
jolt me diesel train started slowly
to move out of the station on its
way to the North and Chlengmai,
my destination.

Monotonous Click

I sighed as I thought or the
eighteen-hour train trip. it would
be a long journey, but also an
interesting one. Thailand is al-
ways morc than willing to provide
a feast for all the senses, so i
knew I would not be bored. Al.

:teady the cuioriul countryside be-
‘gan to flash by as the train

continued to increase speed and
slip out of the city. The late
aiternoon sun played on the stret.»
ches of water in the rice fields
and klungs (canals). Laughing
brownrskinned children leaped and
splashed in the muddy water. A

Then, just as quickly, the colors

New Instructors State Ideals,
Otter Experience, Achievement

Ed. Notell Following are
mries about four of Grinnell‘s
new professors. Next week more
of the new faculty members will
be covered.

Zimmar

A new instructor in psychology
is George P. Zimmar, Zimmar
holds 35. and M.Al degrees from
Roosevelt University. He has spent
the past {our years working on
a variety of research problems in
psychology at the State Univer-
sity of New York at Buffalo. He
also worked as a part-time instruc-
tor at Millard Fillmore College,
the evening division of Buffalo,
teaching physiological and intro-
ductory Psychology, He has been
It lecturer at Rosary Hill College
in Williamsvllle, New York. Sev-
cral of his papers have been pub-
ﬁshed.

Pollak

Desire to teach in a small liber-
al arts school was chief among
the motivations which brought
William Pollak, new instructor in
economics, to Grinnell College this
fall. A graduate of Oberlin Col-
lege, he received his master's
degree from Princeton University.

Preferring a student discussion
approach in his classes. the young
instructor believes that the pur»
pose of a professor is to develop
rtudent interest in his field. "Too
often a teacher feels that his job
Is to impart to his classes the
knowledge which he has accum-
mulated,” he explains. "l teel that
the real challenge is to create a
curiosity about our field and to
show students how to pursue this
curiosity."

 

Nelz'gar

Benny D. Nefzger, new instruc-
tor in sociology at Grinnell, comes
to us with a B.S.c, degree from
the University of Iowa He re
cently completed his M.A. re-
quirements at Southern Illinois
University. where he also finished
nearly all courses for his PhD.
degree.

Between his graduation from
Iowa and his matriculation at
Southern lllinois, he spent three
years in the United States Air
Force and worked for the St Louis
branch of the Maytag Companyl

Edwards

The theory that a liberal arts
education serves no practical pur-
pose is strongly refuted by Jack
Edwards, Grinnell‘s new assistant

professor of political science. “For
most professions, four years ot
college is not enough; more spe-
cialized training is u sually
required." he commented.

Four years of instruction in bus-
iness administration, for example,
is no longer a passport to success
in the business world, according
to the young teacher. “Most com»
panies are interested Ln bright.
capable young men whom they
will be willing to train them-
selves." he continues l‘The broad
understanding and perspective
which result from a liberal arts
education give the Grinnell grad-
uate an advantage over the typi-
cal university graduate."

Specializing in the American [)0
lltical system, Edwards is a grad-
note of Macalester College and
recently completed studies for his
LLB. at Harvard University.

 

‘Hidden Scholarship’ Is Worth $1200
To Us Poor. Tattered Grinnellians

Did you realize that you. you
poor, broke, tattered Grinnelllan,
are the proud, it unwitting, pos-
sessor of a $1200 scholarship? A
“Hidden Scholarship" — that‘s a
clever little term that the adminis-
tration applies to the tact that if
each student were charged the
full cost of a Grinnell education,
he would be coughing up 53700 per
year instead of his present gruel-
ling $2600. And what are the other
sources of financing? Or, to put it

in more Grinnellian terms, who
the heck kicks in the rest?

Well, there's the endowment
fund—including the income pro-
ducing properties, like “our" se-
curities, oil wells and such, which
totaled up are worth about l5 mil-
lion and yield about $350,000 a
year. Then there are capital giits,
like the Ford Foundation affair,
and. on the other hand, gifts from
people. All of which are quite vital
and necessary since the 1964—65
budget was $4,110,619.

Expenses range all the way from
$22,000 tor laundry (think what
they could save it they’d only let
the student body sleep on their
bed pads) to $200,000 in fringe
benefits for employees. Others in-
clude: 75,000 for electricity; 13,000
for water (signiiying that Grinnel—
lians study more and bathe less?)
60,000 for fuel; 16,000 for fire in-
surance (possibly this could be
reduced if some funds were chan-
neled into buying some ashtrays
for ARH); 673,000 for building and
grounds (probably subsidized by
north campus social funds): and
1.400.000 for salaries.

What it all adds up to is that if
someone just off the top of his
head decided to buy GrinnEII Col-
lege, it would cost ’em 25 million.
And although not always consid»
ered an asset by the administra-
tion, it causes one to wonder—is
the student body also included in
this figure?

Wall Discusses Year in Sweden.
Describes Scandinavian Education

By ANNE FARRER

“Like a Minneapolis on the
coast" is how Joseph Wall (his-
tory) describes oothenhurg, Swe-
den. where, taking a bit of a
husman's holiday, he worked at
the University of Gothenburg last
year setting up an American Stud-
ies program.

Teaching a lecture course and
a seminar, he found that Swedish
students do not work quite as
hard as American since they take
their final exams at their own
discretion—and as a result of their
own discretion, some had re
mained ot the university for ﬁve
or six years and gave no indi-
cation ct leaving within the near
future.

Sweden’s educational system
neatly avoids two rather common
us. collegiate problems: open
dorms and beards. The ﬁrst is
due to the fact that Gothenhurg,
as most European schools, has
no residential campus, or much of
a campus at all, since the depart-
ments are scattered all over the
city and the two dorms that they
do have are owned by the govern.
ment and run by the students.

Swedish secondary schools give
the student the equivalent of an
American junior college educa-
tion. and by the time they reach
the university, the students are
approximately 20 and have
"grown out of and gotten over (he
heard stage.”

Wall ter Sweden is "pleas-
ant and civilized country" which
has also rather neatly avoided a
few domestic problems by avoid—
ing war and not having war costs
to burden the national budget.
However, this does not imply that
militarily or ideoligically Sweden
is in a state oi vegetation, for
“it is a neutral but not pacifistic
country" with universal conscrip-
tion. Wall expressed the View that
within the next three or four
years, unless there is an inter-
national armament control, Swe-
den will develop itself as an atom-
ic power. He also observed that
the high standard of living there
is matched and well correlated
with its cost. As for the people,
the Walls enjoyed them, although
“they seemed to be eating most
of the time."

To avoid “the long. dark Swe—

 

dish winter" the Walls traveled to
Greece for Christmas. .During the
summer they made several side
trips: to Leningrad, which had ‘
“depressing air of post-war ex-
haustion” and a limited selection
or material at the news standsn
to the other Scandinavian coun-
tries, which are quite distinct from
one another; and to northern Swo-
den, where Wall attended a semi-
nar tor English teachers from all
over Scandinavia, including Ico-
land.

The Grudge Poi

By DOUG MCCORMAC

Fun, fun, fun! We’ve all had
it, haven't we? Summer was
great. Europe was great. New
York was great. lowa waseox.

I had a miserable summer, of
course So what? Did you have
such a hot time? Get off it, you

, were miserable, too. If you had
fun, at least you felt guilty about
it.

Only one exciting thing hap
pened in my quiet town all sum-
mer. One night, my mother snuck

into the kitchen and snatched two
pretzels.

"You’ll never lose any weight
that way," I warned her later.

She grimuced. “Who asked you?
Why don’t you go down in the
basement and let your clothes
rot.“ She often sniveled like this
when in the wrong, and I knew
that I must treat her more gently.

"Dr. Milliwed says you're is int
ugly slob," I tried.

“Who asked him?" she sniveled.

“You did," I returtedl "You
asked him why you were over-
weight, and he said it was because
you are a fat ugly slob. That pret»
zel won’t improve Dr. Milliwed's
opinion of you, either.”

Actually, I didn’t give a damn
about Drl Milliwed‘s opinion, since
he had been dead for five years.
His dying words were, “She's a lat
ugly slab," and they probably did
not even refer to Mumsie.

But for private recondite rea-
sons that would only interest a
pedant, I wanted to demonstrate
the true reasoning about the mat-
ter to my mother. The reason I
wanted to show up my mother was

 

that she had taken the last pret-
zels.

“They always say, ‘as thin as
a pretzel,’ " she ﬁnally said, smug-
1y.

“who are they?" I screamed
with wild irony. “Why are they
always creeping into our converr
stations? Shall the world never be
rid of this foul conflagration?"

“If we don't keep on eating our
pretzels. it won't," Mumsie said
as she exited. Now I could see
that she was extremely under-
weight. "A pretzel a day keeps
the foul conilagrations away."

“A inul conflagration on your
foul conflagrationsi" I elocu—
tioned. “Never eat a pretzeil” l
universalized with momentous stu-
pendity. "Shove it all," I sniveled
in despair.

It did not matter, for my moth-
er could no longer hear me. She
was in the basement eating pret-
zels while her clothes rotted,

Excitement and fun, as you can
see, have as many faces as a
woman. They need not be glit-
tery and expensive. Often. riot
and dehaunchery, when stripped
of their coarser outer rags, are
naked. Sometimes they are not.

Everything ultimately depends
upon a cheerful, pleasant, opti-
mistic attitude]

ENROLLMENT UP

Campus enrollment for this
year’s fall semester is up nearly
2 per cent over a year ago. While
first semester last year there
were 1145 students registered, this
year there are not) students at»
tending the school. These ﬁgures

Marty Yaseen, vice president and

troduced the speaker.

Future meetings of the group
will feature speakers and a ques-
tlon and answer session on "Free-
dom and Discipline," “Day and

Educare is open to anyone in-
terested in issues regarding edu-
cation.

 

b Encampment

(Continued tram Page 1)

agreed that: a liberal education in-
cluded obtaining sume knowledge
of the practical. To aid this aim oi
education, the group suggested
that more men of affairs be invited
to speak on campus.

This committee also recom-
mended strengthening the rule of
interdisciplinary clubs on campus.

The group discussing the Grin—
nell social situation suggested that
the college attempt to foster closer
college-town relations.

The group given the responsibil-
ity of talking about the college and
its students decided that a more
exciting series of convocations
might help the spirit of commu-
nity that may be ebbing on the
Grinnell campus.

In an effort to bring the ideas
of the encampment back to the
campus, the encampment commit-
tee is planning remeetlngs oi the
original discussion groups later in
the year. Other plans along this
line include distribution and pub«
lication of the final committee re-
ports and coiiehaurs with encamp-
ment participants and interested
students.

urged participation in the project,
spoke of the need tor student come

oi this kind was an excellent op-

Hampered by the fact that the

Although the possibility oi stu-
dent demonstrations in Des Moines
was not ruled out, Karen Olson
said, "The emphasis in civil
rights in the North has changed a
great deal since the passage of

Baﬁleboard . .
. . . ll's Origins

“Oil Why do they call a Baf-
fleboard a Balileboard i . . 7'

it all started quite a long
time ago, according to former
Dean of Women Evelyn Gardr
her, when the collective body
or women house presidents
were called the League Board.
Back in those days, the room-
mates oi the League Board
started a sort of mock-league
Board of their own which tra<
ditionally met in secret at a tacub
iy home each year, for a party.
The secrecy of the party apparents
iy "battled" the League Board,
and the expression inspired the
mock<Leaguel Board to christen
themselves the “Baffleboard.”
(According to Miss Gardner, the
Baiileooard took great pleasure
in matching posted announce—
ments {or the League Board with
their own witty parodies of same.)

The name Baffleboard immedi<
ately became an unofficial tradh
tion, but for about fifteen years
after its debut it was mostly a
joke. Its members included only
the roommates of house presidents.
who were not included in the cone
stitution, and whose duties were
strictly unoiricial. Eventually,
however, ihe duties of the Baffle-
board came to be considered
worthy of oliicial constitutional
provision. Hence the establishment
of the present system requiring
the residence of two Bafﬂeboal‘d
members on every ﬂoor of every
women's hall.

Jjwm, Jim. Mutt

By WAYNE STENGEL

24 years ago—tall at 1941—
found Ihe Grinnell student body,
its seen through the eyes of the
5&3, concerned with war, holi-
days, class cuts, prepping, and
what's at the Strand; altogether
bearing an uncanny resemblance
to our interests in the (all 0(1965.

Over the masthead oi the 1941
Thanksgiving edition oi the 5&1;
appeared this memo in doric type:
"Forget not the five buck fee {or
cutting class today". The admin
istration should never have aban-
doned this policy, They really
had something here What senior
wouldn’t rather lose 1/2 of an ex
Lm credit than shell out live
bucks?

Oh, for the good old days when
you could see Ronald Regan at the
Strand in “International Squad-
ron" at a Saturday matinee for
a dime, and not speaking to voters
in California about the interna»
tional conspiracy. Oh, for that
joyous yesteryear when E. E.
Spencer, at Newton contractor,
tried to sue the freshman class for
stealing Loon ieet of lumber as
part of u prepping stunt. But they
shouldn‘t make movies like they
used to, and they don’t make preps

cember 5. 1941 edition of the 5513.

was iully aroused to the dangers
of Nazism. The 5&B reaction to
this threat was as typically col-
leglate in its iervor as repeated
urgings to remove American
troops irom Viet Nam are today.
To the paper's most ardent critics,
which will include, by May, the
total enrollment of the school mi-
nus the twenty»tliree regular staff
members, this excerpt train a No
vember 21, 1941 edition will make
it evident that, while not neces-
sarily improving in quality, 5&1;
editorials are more sophisticated
in tone The very title, “Hitler
and You" is a tip on to the degree
at personal involvement the writer
wished to elicit in his readers.
1 quote: “Say what you will about
Hitler, you can’t ignore him any-
more than you can do without
your weekly bath! (And don’t
think Grinnell students didn’t try
to do that even in the prevbeatnik
1940s.) Mighty as his Nazi armies
are, the real threat to you is not
to be round in the mighty armor
of the German Reich. Lurking in
the shadows is 2: much greater
factVthat Hitler had succeeded in
moulding a united Germany with
a living, dynamic ideology.” And
so the prophetic voice of doom
moaned melodramatically on,
tinaliy concluding with that most
rabble-rousing nf rhetorical ques-
tions, “Hitler has his Own peculiar
answer to the problem, What is
going to be ours?”

ies that began in 1900, is sched-
uled {or 1:30 p.m, at Ward Field.
It’s the season opener for both
clubsi

“I’m ready for the game, but
I’m not sure the team is,” Coach
Edd Bowers remarked.

He added, "Cornell, a defending

‘c u n for e n c e champion With
good group of returning letter»
men, has to be rated as the favor-
ite. But, we think we have a good
chance of beating them. We are
looking forward to a good game."

All 11 Pioneer lettermen figure
as starters, either on oiiense or
defense The number one units
also include six sophomores. and
several other newcomers Will see
heavy duty in reserve roles.

The probable starting lineup in
cludes Al Peterson and Tom Hill;
Rick Anderson and either Ken Au-
gustine or Jim Moore at tackles;
Nick Nonas and either John Pitt-
man or Tom Russell at guards;
Tum Lannom at center; Barry

Anderson at quarterback; John
Shierholz and either Dave Syn-
horst or Bob Watt at haltbacks;
and Jon Buswell and Dick Lamb
at fullback.

Nord Brua and John Lawson at
ends; Moore and Rick Anderson
at tackles; Augustine at middle
guard; Lamb and Russell at line
backer; Watt, Paul Thurston, John
Kelsey, and eitller Shierholz or
Synhorst in the backfield.

“We have good depth, as good
as we‘ve had in some time,”
Bowers noted. "But, I'm not sure
all of the boys are playing in the
right position. We hope to learn
a lot in the Cornell game."

NDting that Cornell will boast

a considerable weight advantage
in the line, Bowers pointed out
that “we are going to have to he
quicker and more aggressive.”
While Grinnell does not have a
single 200 ppunder, Cornell has
several hetty linemen ranging up
to 263 pounds.

Cornell, which Won seven of
eight outings a year ago to share
the crown with (Joe and Ripon,
