Nuclear Testing

The majority may often be wrong, but proper repre-
sentation should still be important to a Student Senate;
the Students’ News must be taken into consideration when

World War l! Not Forgotten Yei;
in Poland Symbols Still Remain

by Bill Parsons
Polaudlosttwo per cent of the
entire population during World

- - ii This was the highest

tage among all nations
pating in the war. In~

eluded in this number were 31/2
million murdered in concentra-
tion camps during mass execu-
tions and in the ghettos.

Hardly a iamily remains in
which losses were not sutiered.
The economic destruction has
been estimated at more than 5t
billion dollars, and reconstruc-
tion has still not bcen completed.
With these facts in mind. it is
not surprising that they have not
forgotten

War damage, which still exists
in Warsaw, is a reminder and
symbol to the native Pole as
well as to the foreign v"

ever it is feasible to do so. In the external world lobby ,

and pressure g
to the senatoi

oups representing their constituents come

; in our college society, unfortunately, it i

may be necessary for senators to take the pulses of cone

stituents before making a major decision in their name.

Occasionally, however, a case arises which presents a
special problem and demands special action on the part of

the senator. Then the senator must remind himself that he :
is after all a representative in a representative government ‘
system, not a system of pure democracy. He must remind ‘v

himself that his constituents chose him (ideally) because

of his superior sensitivity, experience and his fundamental 5

beliefs, and rest his decisions upon his best judgements.
The point has been reached where a United States de—
cision in favor of resumed testing may be in the offing.
Very recent government statements are not to be cast aside
merely as idlothrents. nor the issue itself passed off. be

cause ”testing must be right or the government wouldn’t ,

consider ”

The government is under pressure from an aggressive
iaction of our society which feels that the only nay to win
an ideological battle is by mass destruction and killings.
it is also under a less powerful pressure from minority hu-
rrtanitarians and peace groups which are attempting to halt
testing and to fight, if fight we must. on ideological and
economic grounds. /

It is our job as students representing an educated, in-
formed part of society to take a stand, and to exert pres
cures as well. '

We were appalled to hear several of the senators
last night say that the resolution presented was not the con
cern of the senate or students. This seems strange since
‘we, as students, represent a good part of the popula-
tion, and since, particularly in this matter, it is our generae
tion, and the generation we hope to bear, that will be most
affected. Moreover, from our ranks should come leadership,
and as leaders we should set the pace for active interest
in national affairs.

The arguments against the resumption of nuclear
testing seem obvious in spite of a decided lack 01' agree-
ment between Dr. Linus Pauling (who says that 400.000
defective children could be born in the next ten years as
a result of a bomb such as the latest Soviet horror) and
Dr. Edward Teller who suggests rather grudgingly that
there may be some danger in radio-active fall-out.

There is a broad issue at hand here. Aside from the
worry of confused chromosomes, we simply cannot take
this sort of chance with human lives. A Strong desire for
life, and a respect for mankind and some of its peaceful
achievements in art and science cannot exist side by side
achievements cannot exist side by side with the destructive
carelessness that calls for continued testing.

Any prestige we might hope to gain by a resumption
of atmospheric testing (though gain seems improbable with
‘neutrals and smaller nationsewanting a moratorium) would
be outweighed by the dangers we would be inviting at
the hands of our push buttons and our bombs. Furthermore,
the government has repeatedly acknowledged that Silcli
testing is of little actual value since bombs already tested,
‘as well as bacteriological and chemical warfare can annihl»
1ate quite effi ently.

It seems of prime importance then, for students to re-
act to the immediacy of the problem, to react while cone
lsideration is still going on among the chiefs of staff and
,the President. Senators should vote yes to the proposed
resolution against testing resumption. If our voice is only
a small one we should remember that we are enjoying a
part in the governmental process; we have taken an initial
step and begun to exert pressure as student leaders on the
side that speaks for respect of human life and peace.

Parsons

in almost every cur nt news
paper and periodical. retcronces
to the war are still to he found.

A majority of Polish post
war iiims and the literature oi
this period express this theme.
Also, almost all discussions of
political and ccouomir ques»
tions lead directly to this
point. The specter of this war
has not yet left Poland.

Many Poles told me that my

visit to Poland would not be
complete without a Visit to
Auschwi . the German concen-
tration erminatiol‘l Camp lo-
cated Just west oi
“Americans just can't imagine
what went on here," is a typical
point of conversation, and, 1
think, in most cases a true one.
An estimated 3V; to 4 million
persons perished in Auschwitz
alone, representing 26 nations.

i Today Auschwitz is a museum.
As one enters he reads the
words “Ai'beit macht ii'ei”
(work gives freedom).

Those transported to this site
were told they were simply be;
ing relocated and that they
would need all their belongings
iIi their new homcs, Everything
was systematically confiscated
and sorted before the inmates
were sent to their work assign~

mems, or to the death cham~
bers.

Prior to the evacuation oi
the camp, the staff set fire, to
the warehouses containing the'
ennii. zted goods. However, in
the s sections which escaped
fire, 348,820 men’s suits, 336,-
255 sets at women's clothes and
a vast number at toothbrushes,
shaving brushes, spectacles,
suitcases and other assorted
articles were round. These col.
iections. along with displays
showing conditions oi the ramp
make up the museum.

To understand more tully
what the war means to the Poles,
let me direct your attention to
two books which have recently
been placed on reserve in the lie
brary, “\Ve Have Not Fol“ ttcn,"
and “The AuschwiizeBirkcnau
Concentration Camp.”

These two books, both well
illustrated. will give you unfm'»
getable insight into the attract-
ties of wa , oven ti you do noth-
ing but 100‘ at the pictures i
dare you to take the time to
look at these books; many won't
be able to hnish once they start.
and many won’t. be able to stop
until they have read and seen

all.

To the Editor:

Monday morning (skip day)
apparently 50 per cent or Dibble
hall was rudely awakened be.
tween 3 and o by a measured
hammering. We poured out of
our rooms to see what and who
could be causing such a racket
at such an ungodly hour. An
industrious B&G employee was
pounding holes in a brick and
plaster wall to install a curtain
rod on a corridor window.

The employee was sympa-
thetic, but he had his orders,
So he continued his striking a
chisel with a hammer every ﬁve
seconds until the job was done.
Tliisdook about 45 minut
These of us who usually \'
up on a skip day with a pound.
lug headache were ni no mood
to have the inner pounding alig—
mented by oiItSido noises.

Someone called Mr. Walden.
He reportedly said he'd check
with the appropriate ioreman
and see what could be done,
By the time this request had
gone through the appropriate
channels, it was too late. The
Job was done, and we were all
awakened.

I called Mr. VValden's secre-
tary, holding the phone out-
side the booth so she could
hear the pandemonium. The
secretary told me she’d check
with the foreman. I told her
there wasn't time; the pound-
ing burl to cease.

Acqiiiesclng, she pointed out
that she did not realize it was
a skip day. Very possibly the
person who told the workman
to out up the curtain rod didn't
know it was skip clay either.
Perhaps it is expecting too much
to ask employees of B&Giat
least those in a supervisory ca.
pacity—to know the calendar oi
their employer.

1 do not suggcst that B&G
stop their intensive' and appre»
ciatcd elicits to improve the
campus. or late their industry
has been particularly gratifying.
as when Con-les lounge was re—
paired ever Parcnts’ Weekend.
By working next to the meal
lines. 3&5 showed all parents,
guests and students that a con»
certed eﬂort was being made to
keep the campus beautiiul,

I complain, rather, against the
policy which sends an employee
into a residence hall at B a,m.
on a skip day with orders which
involve 45 minutes of continual
hammering. student government
has done much to keep the resi—
dence halls quiet to encourage
both study and sleep. Perhaps
some one other than student
government should now tackle
the problem.

sionary work in Africa because
he has spent the past 27 years
at a Holy Cross mission in L

He said that a beliet in God
which is almost intuitive is
found in most of the natives, but
their heliet is not strongly felt,
and they are more aware oi the
presence ‘of evil spirits

Missionaries have to start
then with the little‘that the
people believe, and they go
from a htﬁef in God to grad.

the resolution was not a protest

that it referred to»tests Conduct

senator called for ,a deﬁnition

it was decided that the word

A further point made was

agreeing with this view,
that the Senate cannot assume

Priscilla Eidc agreed, stating
that this is a moral issue, on
which there can be no proper

the moral leelings of their halla

that the meeting was called
hastily and that the Senators
had not had time to think about
the issue.

objections by repeating the {act
that the i'esolulion would be an

Knox scored in the first half

line.

After receiving the ball on-

Kickers Lose;
"lo/Play Carls
Al' Northiield

The Grinnell soccer team’s
powerful offensive machine came
to a halt last Saturday, as Iowa ,
State ended Pioneer hopes for
an undefeated season with a 4—2
victory.

The Iowa State soccer team
managed methodically to score
once in every period, while the
Pioneers counted in the second
and third periods, with Bill
Montfort and Bill Hicks doing
the scoring.

Coach lrv Simone felt that al-
though his team’s play was a
little spotty, it lost to a fine
team, the best the Kickers will
face this season.

Tomorrow morning the Plo-
neer soccer team journeys to
Northfield, Minn., to play Carle-
ton. The game shapes up as an
even match on the basis of com-
parative scores. The Knights of
Carleton go into the contest
with a 471 record, while Grine
nell sports a 3—1 mark

Moore, “The whole team did a
ifine job.” He singled out Ethcle
bah, Mac Marshall Eric Miller
and Ship chrauch for than
performances, but gave credit to
everyone on the team for the
victory.

During the season coach Moore
said that the team improved on
pass defense and that in the fi—
l nal week the offense jelled. The
passing attack which the team
‘1 had planned to use against Knox
. was abandoned because of the
wind. I

The long-postponed doubles
match between Smith and East
has apparently degenerated into
a war of nerves, there being no
action since darkness called off
the first attempt after one set
last Thursday. The winner will
take on Rawson for first place
in the biacket.
