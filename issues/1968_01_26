COLLEGE MAY FACE FEDERAL TAX SUIT

By DAVE HORWATT
By 5&3 Staff Writer

There will likely be a bun-
dred or less private colleges
(out of the present number of
slightly over 3,000) that survive
the next ten or‘ twelve years.
according to Mrs Donald Lam-
bie, Treasurer oi the college.

The problem “is of deep con-
cern t0 the President and trus-
tees” said Lambie, ”because
we can see the trend and its
hard to stop. We're getting
tightened down closer and
closer all the time.

We may not be able to re.
main 3 private college and
have to come under state and
federal control."

He added: “We just can't
keep raising tuition."

Grinnell is now being threat-
ened with a suit by the federal
government concerning certain
farm property the college owns
and claims as tax exempt.

The government contends
that ownership of a farm by
Gtinnell is an “unrelated"
business activity.

This means that the business
and profits derived irnm it are

not essential to the purpose for
which Grinnell was granted tax
exemptions and are therefore
taxableu

“The only out we have," said
Lambie, “is the test case or
the United States VS. The Myra
Foundation."

This test case which is now
on appeal in the Federal Court
in St. Louis will determine the
extent that a non-profit institu-
tion can get involved in busi-
ness and preserve its tax ex-
emption.

if the government wins the
test case, then there will at

least be an eilort to tax the
ram property Grinnell owns,
"it might open a lot of
things,” said Lambie. “It
might open our investment in-
come to being taxed. I’m not
sure how far the Federal gov-
ernment will go back (in our
records). If the government
taxes us we may have to sue,
I don't know. What I say is
that it's a step in a trend."
For about the past five
years, the college has depend-
ed on income from endowment
and gifts for onevlhird of the

for the other twothirds.

As things are now Grinnel!
and private colleges generally
are more expensive than state
universities.

Under proposed tax revision:
by the 93rd congress, private
nonprofit foundations including
private and educational insti-
tutions would lose certain tax
exemptions.

SENATE lAUGHS AT RIC

By NEIL FISCHER

A usually stagnant student
Senate laughed itself silly Wed-
nesday night when SGA Presi-
dent Ric MacDowell tried to
explain proposed Changes in the
residence hall system for next
year.

Changes include, MacDowell
said, “sort of an alternating
dorm system on both North and
South campuses."

“South Younker will probably
be women, and North Younker
will probably be men," Mac-
anell stated. “The halls from
Loose to Haines will probably
be men.”

When MacDoWell said that a
“gate” was proposed between
the two “blocks" of segragated
dorms on South campus, most
senators couldn’t believe it

“A gate? You’re kidding, what
klnd of a gate will 1t be? A
turnstile?” asked Tom Thomas
(Gates).

“An electrified fence," a fe-
male senator suggested.

MacDowell said the gate
would be placed “across the
loggia" and added that it was
being done “for security reaa
sons."

He further added that eventu-
ally the gate would be replaced
by a $30,000 “reception center,"
which has already been ap-
proved by the College Trustees

“It would be in a Central place
(probably between James and
l-laines halls) where the traffic
would go,” MacDowell statedu
“Traffic could drift out of tile
Forum at midnight and into it."

“It sounds like a covered
sidewalk,” another senator
mused.

“No, really." MacDoWell em-
phasized, ”it would be a place
to go and pick up your date, It
would be open 24 hours a day,
and it would have a woman on
duty. You could go there and
call up your date at two in the
morning."

, “But they

turn all the

phones,” a senator suggested.

“Not the hall presidents',"
MacDowell quipped.

The proposed changes, the
SGA President continued, should
be finalized by the next Senate
meeting (January 31).

President Leggett delegated
the taslr or studying changes in
the residence hall system In
the Student Affairs Committee,
and we've been working on it.
After we finish the report will
go back to the president,” he
explained to the group ln ARl-i,

Asked about off campus
houses, MacDowell Said that
several changes had been sug-
gested

“They might be places where
students over 21 could live and
make their own rules. as long
as those rules didn’t conflict
with the rules of the city.”

or, MacDowell said, they
might he oo-ops. Or they might
be arranged, he added, so that
a professor might live with stu-
dents working on an s-credit
hour project with him.

Most of the real yuks centered
around the question of security
in an alternating dnrm system.

MQCDDWell Said that it’s easier
to guarantee “security” on
South campus than on North
campus.

Senators seemed to interpret
this as meaning South campus
might consist of freshman and
sophomore students onlyu

MacDowell said it wasn’t so.

He explained that all classes
would be represented in every
dorm under the proposed sys
tem. Students would be placed
he said, "by a quota system."

But, the SGA President finally
admitted, “the real purpose is
of course to decrease illegal
visitotlons."

“It's obviously an insecurity
complex," a senator then inter-
jected. ,

“All this talk about alternat-

A force of 198 detectives are

"Nail ’em up if they don't deliver!”

A Very Good Notion Indeed

A nervous pat on the back this week to Presi-
'dent Glenn Leggett for his forthright decision to
discuss and decide College policy towards military
recruiting on campus BEFORE the recruiters ac—
tually came.

A few weeks ago—at the height of anti-Dow
demonstrations in scattered American colleges and
universities~columnist Wm. F. Buckley, Jr. praised
the provost of the University of Rochester as “the
nearest thing , r . to a Congressional Medal of Honor
winner in the academic world."

What did the Rochester provost—one Dr. Mc-
Crea Hazlett—do to win such kudos from Conserv-
ative Buckley?

Dr. Hazlett calmly suspended 23 graduate stu-
dents involved in the sit-ins for the entire Spring
semester, thus picking up Buckley’s plaudits as,
oddly enough, “the almost»hero of the forces of
reason.”

He set aside a decision to exonerate “a bunch
of students who, once again, physically prevented
a representative of Dow from meeting with job ap-
plicants."

It seems to the editors of this newspaper that
when one begins giving medals to administrators
who are suspending students left and right, one has
lost some perspective.

Buckley, while lauding Hazlett, had unkind
words for the administrators of Harvard University
who after “a goodish show of indignation . . . did
not convincingly discipline the students”

Well, anyway, what did President Leggett do
to earn his pat on the back? He decided that to wait
until after trouble was happening was absurd—
even for a college president.

He asked a Marine recruiting team to postpone
its visits until he could sample the student body to
see what, exactly, feeling toward military recruit-
ment on campus at Grinnell actually is.

Dr. Leggett didn’t sit on his rump and wait to
expell students, as did Dr. Hazlett. He didn’t have
to exonerate any students. as did the powers that
be at Harvard.

The Scarlet & Black thinks he did the right
thing and that his‘“noti0n that the time to discuss
potential trouble is before it happens" is a very
good notion indeed.

If Dr. Hazlett deserves a Congressional medal,
I think we can at least give Dr. Glenn Leggett a
nervous pat on the back.

Sampling Siuilent Opinion

Survey of student attitude at Grinnell, like
everything else at this place, have always suffered
from non—involvement —— which is to say, apathy.

Past editors of the S&B and many campus or-
ganizations have attempted to sample student opin-
ion by mailbox questionnaires. What they usually
got back consisted of a handful of responses, of
which fully half were jags.

This semester’s S&B will be running student
polls on various campus and off-campus issues every
week, and the editors urge you take them seriously.
Fill them out and be honest when you fill them out.

On page five of this newspaper, you will find
a questionnaire on campus military recruiting. Re-
turn it to us today, and we'll have some answers for
you next week.

lug residence halls seems pretty
silly to me and most of the

Doug Tolleisen (Dibble) said to
wards the end of the alternating
discussion and laughter.

Tollefsen said that Changes in
the counselling system seemed
more important to him ihan n1.
temating sexes in the halls.
MacDowell emphasized that the
Student Affairs Committee was
working on counselling “as one
of its most important consid-
orations.”

Senior Senator T. J. Smith
(Gates) probably best summed
up the entire discussion on the
subject.

“I almost wish I was coming
back next year to see it," Smith
avowed, “A really highly-inte-
grated police state.”

long after the laughs on open
donns and long after ihe Senate
had pondered several other
items, a freshman from Smith
—nat a senator -— bmught the
Senate info a state of extremely
quiet seriousness.

James Trotter stood before
the student government repre-
senfatiVeS and asked, in essence,
for a student vote “on whether
we want alternating dorms or
the status quo."

“On a mailer as important
as our living conditions,” Trot-
ter declared, “we should have
a say in whether we want u
change or not.”

Trotter asked {or a sampling
of the student body. In the next
issue of the 5&3 (February 2)
a questionnaire on the subject
will appear.

"No one has any idea of gen-
oral student opinion on the sub.
ject yet," Trotter concluded,
“and We have to know what the
sludents think before we can act
in Iheir interest."

ANTI-ANTI—WAR AGENCY

By SHEILA RYAN
LIBERATION News Service

WASHINGTON. Jan. 19 —~ The new unit of the Justice Depart-
ment, established to deal with violations of the Selective Service
laws is apparently to be a super-secret entity, The Justice Dept.
has refused to release any information on the plans of the unit
or the names of personnel assigned to it.

Officials also refuse to specify the number of employees under
the unit, or even to state whether it is “tiny" or “massive.”

The special prosecution unit is headed by John Van de Kamp,
former US. Attorney for the Central District of Califomla and
currently Deputy Director of the Executive Office for US. At~
tomeys.

The Justice Dept. has turned down all requests from the press
for interviews with Mr. Van de Kamp.

The Attorney General’s year—end repnn stated that “intensive
investigative and legal work done in 1967 was to lead to prosecu~
[ions in 1963 for aiding and abetting violations of Selective Service
law—the first such prosecutions in a decade."

in 1567, the Justice Dept. initiated 1,648 prosecutions undet
the Universal Training Act.

This represents an increase of 62 per cent over 1966, and 220
per cent over 1965.

952 convictions were obtained, a figure up 78 per cent from
1966 and 250 per cent from 1965. The average sentence meted out
to those convicted under the draft law increased from 25.4 months
in 1966 to 32.1 months in the past year.

Recent statements by Attomey General Ramsey Clark indi-
cate that the Justice Dept, is gearing up for a crackdown on in-
surgent elements of the American population.

Six weeks ago. in an announcement of the fonnation of the
draft law prosecution unit, Clark said, “All U.S. Attorneys have
been instructed to expedite investigation and prosecutorial recom-
mendations on these cases. They have also been directed to co
operate wxfh local law enforcement officials and to urge them
to vigorously prosecute violations of local laws which may occur
in demonstrations against the Selective Service System." _

One Justice Dept. employee who has no reluctance to voice
her views on action against resistors ls Mrs. Audrey Shippen, of
the visitors‘ information desk.

Mrs. Shippen disclosed that “someone higher up than my im-
mediate superior” had instructed her to beat a quick retreat from
her post heat the Tenth Street and Pennsylvania entrance to the
building “if things got rough" during the demonstration on Jan.
12.

Mrs. Shippen said she was not afraid at the time because
she was “well protected” by G.S.A. guards, including reinforce-
ments irom buildings other than the Justice Dept, “some city
police, plain Clothesmen, and maybe F.B.l.”

She whispered, “They even used walkie-talkies . . . Oh yes,
they did, Uncle Sam’s not asleep at the switch, as some of those
demonstrators think he is.”

Mrs. Shippen asserted that the elaborate precautions for the
security of the Justice Dept. were necessary because "those
people aren’t mentally balanced, you know. You never know
what they might do.”

Did she think Dr. Spock for example, might go berserk in the
Justice Dept}? “You can never tell about those creatures. I never
read his book myself, but I know some mothers who did, and
personally, i think what he wrote about babies is a lot of bull."

put further burdens on the bud-
get of the private college.
John I-lolt Myers, attorney
with the iirm of Williams,
Myers and Quiggie wrote in
the American Alumni Council's
COMMENTARY: I‘Tha (tax)
regulations as proposed indi-
cate once again that colleges
and universities which now are
not even required to ﬁle in~
come tax retunis are becoming
more and more involved with
the Federal income tax law.

According to the Des Moines
Register: “Average tuition at
the private colleges in iowa
this year is about $1,097, some
$724 higher than at the state
universities.

The gap has been widening
for several years."

Grinncll's tuition ior 1968-69
Will be 32.125. Even beiore the
new tax proposals could take
effect, the private College is at
a disadvantage financially.

The higher tuition costs and
other problems or the small
college were discussed at Grin<
nell's Legislator Dinner last
Thursday the 18th.

Dr, Irwin J. Lubhers, Presi«
dent of the Iowa Association of
Private Colleges and Universi-
ties said that the privately
supported colleges "are really
facing a buZZvSaw, Many are
just scared to death the private
college is going to go the same
way the private academy did."

The President of Drake Uni-
versity, Dr. Paul F. Sharp,
suggested a program of state
grants-in-aid to college students
to put the cost of education at
private colleges within the
reach of more Iowans.

While the three state univer-
sities are overcrowded and
Spending millions of dollars in
tax money to build more iacili<
ties, Sharp said, there are 9,000
spaces available to students in
the 23 private colleges and uni-
versities of lowa.

The estimated cost oi the
grants-in—aid program is $4 < $7
million tor the iirst two years.

If the state universities were
to absorb the 36,505 students
now enrolled in private institu-
tions, the operating costs alone
are computed by Sharp at £32
million.

This does not include addi-
tional classrooms and dorms.

Lamble concluded: “In my
opinion, they (the U.S. govA
ernment) Will have to turn
around and supply higher edu-
cation . . . possibly even to
graduate school.”

The words SCARLET a BLACK in the newspaper’s ﬂag on page one are set in Pill-
DlAN type style, a type race which came into prominence about the time Iowa Coilege
moved rrom Davenport to merge with J. B. Grinneil‘s proposed university.

A Iprgrapber’s manual or Ihe 1870’s said that PHlDlAN “. . . suggests action, even

inspiration

. It is a strong band gloved in velvet."

The Grinnell College newspaper began in 1871 as the iOWA COLLEGE NEWSLETTER
and later incorporated the PULSE, a competing college publication, to tor-m a paper called
THE UNIT. In the early 1890’s, that paper changed its name to the SCARLET & BLACK.

Long noted as ”the oldest college newspaper West or the Mississippi," the 5&3 begins
its 194th semester or publication with portraits or J. n. Grinnell and Horace Greeley in

its nag.

Greeley told Grinnell to go West and thus coined a byword in American history. This
semester‘s editors of the 3&3 consider this newspaper, thereioie, a scion or Greeley‘s in-
ﬂuential New York WEEKLY TRIBUNE, which has itseu become a byword in the his

tory oi American journalism.

THE RIGHT

By
Wm. F. BUCKLEY, Jr.

The President, it is said, handswrote the version of the Stat.
of the Union address we all heard, and the credibility gap n0t<
withstanding, it is altogether plausible that it is so.

it was a pretty awiul speech, awiul in every sense. in con-
cept, it was utterly unimaginative. in style, totally, relentlessly
lacking in distinction. Mr. Johnson’s deliveryisurely?Ais the
worst in history? My own memory goes back only as tar as FDR,
who was supreme, and they say that President Buchanan was
pretty bad, but sight unseen, I'd listen to James Buchanan read
through the entire encyclopaedia, rather than the incumbent recite
one poem by Edgar Guest,

The principal deficiencies of the speech have been only re-
marked—the lailure to integrate the Vietnam War to our foreign
policy; the iailure to explore the root causes at the restlessness
to which he rleetingly alluded; the encyclopaedic enumeration
of all the blessings he has conferred upon us (the President even
found time to mention his program tor the redwood trees in Calif<

and whispered “better redwoods than deadwoods," whereupon I
granted him a plenary indulgence for all his past sins); etc. etc.
etc.

But besides all that, the speech was peppered with irritating
phrases or little moment except insofar as they suggest the proiila
oi the President’s thought.

What are We to make. for instance, of the sentence: “Tonight
our nation is accomplishing more for its people than has ever
been accomplished before”? A moment's concentration on that
sentence leads one to the brink of total dismay. Consider, to begin
With the syntax. What does he mean, “tonight”? Apparently. a
synonym — more technically, a synecdoche — for “At this point.”
But the clumsiness is distracting. And then again, on the point or
syntax, it one learns English good like a President should, you
don’t Change from the active voice (“our nation is accomplishing”)
to the passive voice (‘2 . . than has ever been accomplished") un-
less required to by a great national depression. or a world war.

And finally, What is this about “the nation" accomplishing
something for “its people"? The nation is its people. If he meant
to say that the people at America are accomplishing a great deal
tor the people at America, then that's okay, only hardly worth
saying because it is tautolcgtcal. One cannot retrain irom sus-
pecting that what the President had in mind was “the govern-
mentLthat he meant to say that “the government" is accomplish-
ing more tor the people.

whereupon one objects: but THE GOVERNMENT isn't THE
NATION. And don‘t forget Illat, buddy. And tempted moreover
to insist: the people don't belong to the government, so that John<
son should not have referred to the nation’s accomplishing more
tor “its" people.

Let those who Will say that this is nitpicking. I write for those
who care to ponder the President's thought habits, which, ideally,
should be all of the nation's people.

Or consider this: “Surely a nation that can go to the moon
can place a decent home within the reach of its families." Once
again, a statement which, read last, or heard fast, tends to cross
the stage quickly, and disappear into the wings of platitude, But
it is a very foolish thought. In the ﬁrst place, it is a government
that decides whether to go to the moon.

And the way the government gets to the moon is by taking
money from the people which might otherwise have been spent in
building more houses.

It is relentlessly clean that the government of Russia couldn‘t
possibly go to the moon if it permitted the people the freedom to
spend their money as they saw fit, And it is relentlessly clear
that the United States will have fewer house on account of our
decision to go to the moon. _

And again, What is this business about a nation’s “placing" a
decent home within the reach or ”its” (there we go again) iami.
lies? The government has practically nothing to do with houses,
it you consider government-built or subsidized houses as a per
centage of the whole, (Between 1550 and 1960, tree enterprise built
13,000,000 housing units, While the government, net, destroyed
100,000.) The people or America come within reach of houses as
a result of their own exertions, and as a result of the disposition
of other people to save. Whrtt makes it ditiicult ior people to build
their houses is: a) taxes (taken by the government); b) inflation
(caused by the government); and c) restrictive labor union polb
cies (protected by the government.)

Tile most usetul thing the government could do to place de-
oent homes within the reach oi its people, is go away.

And so on. Fortunately, the state or the union is better than
the state oi its President’s mind.

PROTESTS OPEN LIBRARY?
UP TO LEGGETT

By DON HECKER

Two weeks ago, Larry Frallk
made an appointment to meet
with President Leggett about
keeping the college library open
until 1 a.n1.

Thursday morning last Frank
went in to see Leggett’s secrea
tary about the appointment.
The secretary said she had none
listed and didn‘t know if one
were planned.

Said Frank: “I don’t quite
know how to say this, but un-
less there is some evidence of
progress, the demonstrations
will start again this evening."

The meeting was held that al-
temOOll.

Attending were Frank, David
Swee (of the committee that
held last semester’s library
demonstrations), Ric MacDowell
(SGA President), Pmi. Arnold
Adeiburg (Judicial Council
Chairman), and Dean 5. Eugene
Thompson.

Leggett lirst reviewed the let-
ter sent to him on the third
day of demonstrations. The leta
ter, which urged that the library
be left open until l mm, (with
the circulation desk Closing at
11:30 p.m,), indicated that AWS
Board and C oi HP members
had volunteered tn serve with—
out pay after 11:30 until help
could be found.

It also referred to an earlier

petition, signed by over two stu<
dents. which also requested
longer library hours.

After expressing disappoint—
ment that demonstrations had
been held before the Faculty Li-
brary Committee made an otil-
cial recommendation, Leggett
promised he would turn the is-
sue over to the Student Aliairs
Committee, and to have an an-
swer on the question by Febr»
uary 1.

The 8&3 learned Thursday
from Prof. John Burma (Stu-
dent Affairs Committee Chair-
man) that the committee would
officially recommend to the
President that the library he
lett open until one o’clock.

Frank became concerned late
last semester when he learned
iron-l an SGA oiiicial about a
week before iinals that the li-
brary committee had taken no
official action, but had unoffi-
cially decided not to leave the
library open until 1 a.m.

He talked to John Wiles and
Rio MacDowell, MacDowell told
him: “I didn‘t think it (demon-
strations) would be entirely de-
trimental.”

An Ad Hoc committee of
Frank, David Swee and John
Wiles was termed. “We had no
idea the (library) committee
was doing nothing," Frank ex.

SCARLET AND BLACK

plained. “We wanted to express
our disappointment through the
demonstrations.”

The demonstrations began the
Sunday night beiore finals last
semester. Along with the demon-
strators were several sympathi-
zers who had been studying and
did not leave at the library’s
regular closing hour. Frank esti-
mated about 30 students welo
involved the first night.

Dean Thompson arrived and
demanded that the demonstra-
tors “get the Hell out of here.”

Frank replied that they would
not do this. Thompson then sat
down and wrote out a statement
that the demonstrators had
been told to leave and had re-
(used.

He presented this to Frank to
sign and then got the signatures
of the other demonstrators—a
procedure he repeated on the
second night of the demonstra-
tions.

The demonstrators left at 12:30
am. “We had made our point,"
Frank said, "if nothing was
done, we would stay until one
o’clock the next night."

No action was taken, and the
demonstrations continued Mon»
day night until one o'clock,

On Tuesday, Dean Thompson
asked Larry to sign a statement
declari that he took full re-
sponsib ity tor the condition of
the library after its closing.
Larry asked him to add David
Swee and John Wile’s names,
and then he signed.

The demonstrations had no ef-

GRINNELL’S FIRST DRAFT DODGER

Grinnell Professor Jesse Macy, who created the first department of political science
in the United States at then Iowa College in 1889, was also the college‘s first draft dodger.

Drafted for the Union Army in 1864 while in the “junior preparatory class’" at Grin-
neli, Macy claimed legal exemption from military service as a Quaker.

“The military ofﬁcers refused to honor this exemption," according to Grinnell historian
John S. Nollen, “and insisted on his hearing arms, but he steadily declin

Nollen, in his history of Grinnell College, said that Macy was also denied hospital serv-
ice as a wuscieutim objector.

Macy remained with his army unit and participated, apparently as the only noncom-
bntnnt, in Sherman’s March to the Sea.

The Grinnell student and later instructor despised the military. “His personal contact
with Ihe pretentious rigidity and arrogance of the limited military mind," Nollen conclud-
ed, “was calculated to conﬁrm him in his loyalty to Quaker principles."

Macy was finally given a hospital assignment shortly before the close of the War he-
tween the States, and in 1866 he returned to Grinnell as n [reshmm

Although it appears on the

It is merely “A design mo-

The new design motif, she
said, is being used on College

“The idea, of course. is that
we may adopt the modern de-

position. Before the demonstra-

Iicially decided, in Chairman

“. . . it was the wrong move
to open the library without pro-
tessional personnel.”

Kintner stressed that he was
making no allegations that stu-
dents were less responsible than
professionals,

Librarian Henry Alden felt
there were some difﬁculties

Response lo Viet Petition

OTHERS SPEAK FOR LBJ

Presidential and Congressmns
al response to the Grinnell Stu-
dent Movement’s (GSM) antl-
wal' petition circulated last
semester “was pretty slim” ac-
cording to the GSM Vietnam
Committee's Ron Miller.

Miller said that by the begin-
ning of Interim (January 12) the
Vietnam Committee had re-
ceived only tour official reac-
lions to the petition. He added
that those reactions, for the
most part, “weren’t exactly
satisfying."

Sen. Robert F. Kennedy (D-
N. Y.) wrote a short note to
Vietnam Committee members on
January 8.

“Thank you for sending me a
copy of your petition to end lhe
war in Vietnam," Kennedy said,
“i appreciate your thoughdul-
ness in doing so.”

Kennedy also enclosed a re-
print of a recent Look magazine
article he had lead into the
Congressional ltecord on No-
vember 28.

in the article, entitled "What
Can We Do To End the Agony
of Vietnam," the New York sen-
ator called for “negollatlons
as the only possible way out
of the agony of Vietnam.”

Sen. Jacob Javitts (RsN. Y.)
wrote to his “friends" on the
Vietnam Committee on January
4.

“Thank you lor your letter or
November 16,” he said. “I ap-
preclate having your views and
will keep them in mind, you
may be sure."

That was all from Sen. Javlts.

The most encouraging reply,
Miller said, was from Sen.
Charles H. Percy (R-lll.). The
letter irom Percyirlle longest
one yet received by lhe GSM
committee—began by thanking
members “for taking the time
to write me of your concern
over the War in Vietnam.”

“Like you, I am deeply trou-
bled by many aspects of this
cruel conflict," rercy cumin-
ned. “I Inl particularly dis—
trested that innocent women
and children should suffer and
die in a wax which they did not
Start and cannot understand."

“I have repeatedly and force-
fully criticized the Johnson Ad-
ministration for its rigidity [0-
Ward peace initiatives," the
Senator said.

“Let me assure you,” he con-
cluded, "that I shall continue
my ettorts to promote a just
settlement of the war as soon as
possible.”

one copy or Ihe Vietnam Pe-
tition was sent to President

Johnson. The reply, however,
came lrom the Departmenl at
State.

"Thank you Im‘ your recent
letter about VietrNam to Free
ident Johnson,” wrote Dixon
Domlelley, an Assistant Secre
iaiy tor Public Affairs, on De-
cember 20, “which has been
brought to our attention.”

“We share the Fl‘eSldem'r
genuine interest in knowing the
opinions of the American peo»
ple," the Department of State
assistant avowed.

“We wish it were possible to
respond in tun to every letter;
however, the volume of mail
makes necessary this type or
acknowledgement,” the short
note elldeu.

Signed prior to and during the
Grinnell College Convocation in
October, the Vietnam Petition
Said that the Conflict in 50min
East Asia was “immoral in its
useless loss of lives."

It further listed three points
agreed to by all who signed n:
that bombing of Vietnam—
North and South—should cease;
that the U. S. should declare a
unilateral ceasefire; anti that
the U. S. should recognize that
the National Liberation Front
has significant support in the
South and should be allowed to
negotiate.

miller said that about twenty.
live copies of the petition were
mailed to President oohnson,
Cabinet members, and Con-
gressmen (notably Senators uni
representatives on the Armed
Services committees).

The Vietnam Committee had
earlier stated that students who
Wished to have copies or the
signed petition sent to their Con-
gressmen at home could do so
by paying a tee for mailing and
reproduction.

According to Miller, no one
took the GSM up on their offer.

“No one paid us thymll‘lg,"
Miller stated, “but we sent off
some copies free anyway.”

Over ilve»hundred members
of (he Grinneli communityistu-
dents and faculty members-
signed the petition, which was
not mailed until the midtlle 01'
November.

According to ofﬁcials of the
Vietnam Committee, 41 per~
cent of the student body signed
the petition. it was also signed
by several Convocation guests,
including Princeton. N. J, an»
thropologist Ashley Montagu and
Yale dramatist Richard Gilman.
The last signature on the GSM
petition was Marlin Luther

King, Jr.’s.

Campus Recruitment Scanned

USMC WAITS FOR LEGGETT

President Glenn Leggett and College Director of Placement
Nicholas Ryan weren’t exactly gungrho when the Marine Corps
Officer Selection Team offered to visit Grillnell and recruit on
campus. The visit. scheduled for January 13, was cancelled.

[ii a letter to Capt. Bruce McKenna, a Marine Corps Selection
Ullicer, Leggett asked recruiters to "wait until our discussions are
rinished and our policy clearly articulated."

“As you are aware, a good deal oi attention has been focused
recently on the recruitment process on college campuses," Leg-
gett emphasized in the December 27 letter. “and we are now in
the midst ot such policy discussions at Grillnell."

“We expect to Complete the discussions shortly." he con-
cluded, “but would prefer to have them without the pressure of
an early deadline. Accordingly, we would rather that you did not
visit us on January 23. . .

“As soon as we have reached a Clearer understanding of our
responsibilities to our students in so lar as recruitment and place-
ment are concemed, we will be in touch with you."

To ieach that "clearer understanding,“ Leggett told the sub.
on ad hoc committee on recruitment and placement has been cre-
ated by the college udmhiistrutloii.

The ad hoc committee, which held its first meeting January
12, includes three members of the Executive Council (Prof. Alan
Jones, Prof. John Kleinschmidt, and Chairman of the Faculty
Joseph Wall); the Chairman of the Judicial Council (Prof. Arnold
Adelberg); the Chairman of the Student Alfairs Committee (Prof.
John Burma).

Committee members also include four students —— all from the
student government's executive cabinet: SGA President Ric Mac-
Dowell:CofHP Presidentrkonald Cogswell; AWS Board President
Leida Schoggen; Speaker of the Senate Phil Bertenuial.

Leggett said the decision to ban military recruiters temporar-
ily came “after noting trouble other colleges and universities have
had during and after such campus recruiters' visits."

“It is my nation," the president told the SEE, “that the timl
an discuss potential trouble is beiore it happens and not after.”

“We Weren't particularly expecting trouble," Leggett ex«
plained, “but other Campuses that didn’t expect trouble had 50ml
anyway."

The president cited recent demonstrations against the Dow
Chemical Company, notably at Harvard and the University at
Rochester, as examples of “troublesome” recruiting situations,

According to placement director Ryui, Dow has not visited
Grinnell during recent years and has not scheduled a recruitment
visit here this year.

Marine recruiters Came to Grinnell during the first week of
school last semester, Ryan said.

“There was absolutely no difficulty when they came in Sep-
tenlber," Ryan added. “People were just coming back to school
and weren't very concerned about the possibility oi protesting."

Teh ad hoc committee on recruiting has reached no conclu-
sions, Leggett said. He added that the Committee would like a
sample student opinion on campus recruiting as to whether agen-
cies and Corporations linked with the Vietnam war should be al-
lowed on campus.

“I have no reason to believe . . . Violence could be provoked
on the Grinnell campus," Leggett said in a mailbox letter to stu—
dents yesterday.

But, he added. “if the opportunity interests you, will you write
me within the next two weeks your own view of the positions an
institutional statement on recruiting and protesting ought to ake?"

Leggett emphasioed that such a sampling of opinion would not
{me the College into a policy oi “selective recruiting.

A questionnaire on recruiting appears on page five of this
Week's 5&3.

in the Spring of 1966, students at Grinnell College became
among the first to demonstrate against campus recruitment visits
of the Central intelligence Agency.

Six students engaged in non-violent protest of a CIA recruit-
ment visit. and no disciplinary action was taken by the adminis-
tration. The protest, however, received national publicity from
wire services.

“The gentleman from the CIA told me later," Ryan mused,
“that he didn't mind the protest here at all. In fact he said it pro-
duced a number of unsolicited inquiries into job opportunities with
the CIA.“

BAN LIFTED

WASHINGTON, Jan. 19 (CPS)
—George Washington Universi—
ty has lifted its ban on military
recruiters.

The university, along with Am«
herst College and Columbia Uni-
versity, has banned recruiters
as a result of Selective Service
Director Lewis Hershey's letter
to local draft hoards recom-
mending the induction oi anti»
war demonstrators.

George Washington President
Lloyd H. Elliott said the ban
was lifted because of a recent
White House statement that
the draft Would not be used to
punish demonstrators and a
statement by the Justice Depart-
merit that prosecution of draft
violators would be lelt to the
Courts.

Hershey has refused to com-
ment on the White House state
merit and has openly disagreed
with the Justice Department
position, but Elliott said the two
statements "clearly indicate
that the courts will provide the
mean: of redress and protec-
tion.”

“These developments make it
possible, he said, for the Uni<
versity to return to its basic
policy of an open campus.‘ "

Neither Columbia l'ior Amherst
have announced any plane to
rescind their orders.

DRAFT DODGER' S GUIDE TO EUROPE

By DAVID SALTMAN

COPENHAGEN, Derb
mark (CPS) -—- In the middle
of October, two three-loot sup-
ply rockets landed in the Us.
Army Compound in West Eer—
lin to disgorge thousands of
leaflets addressed to the 5,000
American soldiers garrisoned
there. They gave advice on
how to avoid sen/ice in Viet-
nam and ended:

“We olier you refuge in Can-
ada, Sweden, or Denmark. if
you have a chance to spend a
weekend on leave in Denmark,
ring the following telephone
numbers. . ."

On May 28 Dutch National
Television claimed over 500
US. soldiers stationed in
Europe had deserted.

Gen. James Polk, Com-
mander—in-Chief oi the US.
Army in Europe and ol the
U.S. seventh Army said there
has been no rise in the number
of American desertions in re-
cent months.

On August 17 the London
TIMES said in a special re~
port that “more than 1,000
American servicemen stationed
in Europe are expected to de-
lert this year.”

Then Secretary of Defense
Robert McNamara described
the Times’ story as “sheer non-
nonsense.”

What's going on?
POSITIVELY E00 DESERTERS

“I can say positively that
there have been at, least 600
desertions irom the American
Army in Europe this year.
There are male to come,"
btated Poul Nexmand, the sec-
retary of the Danish affiliate of
the War Registers’ Internation-
ll.

“It is impossible to give an
exact number (of deserters)
because they are being pro-
tected by several organizations
in all the Western European
countries," added an official 0!
a radical Danish youth organi-
lotion.

The Danish minister of jus-

tice will grant residence per—
mits to American refugees “as
long as they don't make too
much nuise," the otlicial atlde
ed. “At present there are 25
American political refugees in
Copenhagen alone — desertels
and draft resisters.

'There is a bill now under
study in the Danish Parlia-
ment which will almost auto—
matically grant American de~
setters asylum in Denmark.

Since the Danish hill hasn't
passed yet, American soldiers
who want to desert for politi-
cal reasons are advised to go
to Sweden. France, Canada or
Algeria, according to an offi-
cial of the Danish Socialist
Peoples' Party.

Follr American sailors who
jumped ship in Japan to pro-
test the Vietnam war have
been granted political asylum
in Sweden. Canada’s position
is well known. France grants
similar political asylum; A1-
geria treats American relu-
gees like heroes.

A man known as “Mr. Cook"
is the head of the French de-
serter network. He says that
every European country has
active groups who will look
alter American deserters and
get them to neutral countries.
DESERTION MOTIVES VARY

Pacifist groups and radical
organizations realize that de-
sertion isn't always for politi-
cal reasons.

“We don’t care," comment-
ed Knud Jensen, 3 Danish ac<
tivist who handles desertion
cases. “of course we would
like to have a deserter who is
a Marxist. you know, but it is
enough to show the American
people that their army isn't
holy."

The international Herald
Tribune reported last summer
that deserters were only
granted assistance after they
signed a statement against the
Vietnam war. Danish authori—
ties repudiated the Trlbuno
statement.

in Copenhagen. “This is ahso
lutely false. if any soldier

American wants to avoid con»
scription, we will help him

Any soldiers who wish to de-
sert should call me in Copen-
hagen.”

DESERT WHILE 0N LEAVE

Would-be deserters have a
number of ways to get off
their bases and into neutral
countries.

Gordon Mepham, 28, told re-
porters that he had deserted
last August in Vietnam by vol-
unteering for extra service.
This entitles a U.S. soldier to
30 days leave anywhere in the
world.

Mepham went to England
and told the press that he “did
not intend going back to Viet-
nam,"

“I know of many other sol-
diers who have deserted and
come to Britain," he added.

Soldiers stationed in Europe
can simply get a weekend pass,
hop on the Friday night train
to Copenhagen, and he assured
of full protection by dinner-
time Saturday.

forehand, they can be hustled
on a night boat to Sweden
where they will be safe.

It a deserter wants to go to
France, it is slightly more
ticklish. Though the French
have withdrawn from NATO —
and thus are not required to
return deserters to us. forces
— they are still nominal Amer-
ican allies.

A deserter in France is usuv
ally put up in a town with it
strong Left. The groups pro-
tecting him, using the leveraga
of the Left in the countryside,
negotiate for a residence per-
mit. Paris quietly grants the
permit, on the condition the
refugee keeps his mouth shut.

PRETTY GIRLS,

BARS BEST CONTACTS

"it is really quite simple to
contact the soldiers. A name
and phone number written on a
lavatory wall, a pamphlet, a
sympathizer in a place used
often by Gl's,” Denmark’l
Nexn'land noted.

“We have n couple of pretty
girls who speak excellent Eng-
lish, and we send them down

diers,“ szld Nexmand.

“We also have a sympathizer

RADIO STATIC

The campus radio station—
in fetal stages last semester—
is expected to begin broadcast-
ing by February.

Personnel Director Albert
Cloud said they wuldn’t start
because the equipment hadn’r
arrived. The equipment, he in-
dicated, was not in because at
confusion over whether the do
nor -— the owner of Falrchild
Electronics — would be supply-
ing the money or the equipment.

Money for all but the trans-
mitter and the antenna, is being
supplied by Fairchild. The equip»
ment, purchased from Gates
and Allied Electronics, has been
placed on order and is expected
to arrive “any time now — to-
morrow, or the next day, or the
next,” says station manager
Eabak Armajani.

The transmitter and antenna
were gifts of Grinneil trustee
Robert Noyce. Noyce happens
to be Vice President oi Fair-
child Camera and Instrument
Inc,

Records for the station, EC-
cordlng to Cloud, have gener-
ally been donated by the record
companies. An SGA budget of
$1000 annual operating expenses
may also be used toward the
purchase oi records.

Armajani says that there are
over 200 record albums in the
library at present, and “an
infinite number of 45's."

A dozen office chairs and I
big table arrived last Friday.
The reason that furniture had
not arrived until now, says
Cloud, is “we couldn’t order un-
til we had the money. Now."

DANGERS lN
PHONY PAMPHLETS

There are dangers, of course,
since American ofﬁcials don’t
take all this too happily. There
is also on intriguing suspicion
here that the CIA is publishing
leaﬂets which advise soldiers
to desert, but gives them (also
contacts.

The soldiers calls a number
in Copenhagen and says, “i
want to desert," The voice on
the other end says "Okay,
where are you? We‘ll
come and pick you up.” The
guy says “I’m at such-and.
suc ,” and in 15 minutes he's
in jail.

The CIA suspicion started
when some radical students in
aerlin picked up some of the
pamphlets they had distributed
to US. soldiers. They found
some with altogether new
phone numbers and addresses
listed as contacts.

“We're not sure, of course,"
lays Poul Nexmand. “I mean,
it could be a proctlcal joke by
men irom outer space.”

SEW“.

By FRITZ SCHWALLER

In truth the book store is a
ﬁne place in which to purchase.
Spanish dictionaries cost less
there than in Mexico; Harper
Torchbouks are sold at list and
all defective copies are “ex<
changed for perfect copies
without penalty,"

But even though the prices

‘ are those which are suggested
by the companies and the es-
tablishment offers many sun<
dry commodities at equally

_‘ reasonable prices, all is not
Well.

It is the nature of a student
to be overly concerned about
seemingly trivial matters, Yet
the fact remains that certain
institutions Contact us daily,

It is in these routine contacts
that such trivium becomes elk
oeedingly bothersome.

I take as examples two ag-
‘gravating policies of our book
store. The ﬁrst of these is the
insistence upon checking one‘s
name against the role of stu-

ttdEI‘ILS each and every time one
attempts to cash a check. re<
gardlcss of the fact that one
has been there three times al«

'ready that day tor a similar

‘ service, And regardless of the

:fact that one‘s name is printed
on the check with the following
notice: “Grinnell College, Grin-
neli, Iowa, 50112."

The second of these trivial
complaints become much less
trivial and much more impor-
tant the more often it occurs,
The practice in question is that
oi placing a gooey price stick~
er on the cover of each and
every "text" book sold.

The reasoning behind this
practice is clear: so that the
book store will know which
books not to accept for refund,
such as those not sold by them
or sold by them in a previous
semester, The only justification
for placing this sticker on the
cover, as opposed to some-
where else, is to facilitate
pricing-unpacking and check-
out.

But the implications of this
practice to the student are
much greater in scope, This
practice means that all Chem-
istry majors will, for the rest
of their careers, have eimer a
white blotch or a sticky blotch

on their $13.95 Organic Chem- ,

istry hardbouud.

Or that the Spanish majors
will have is ripped spot, where
they had attempted to tear off
the sticker on his copy of The
Generation of 1m paperback.
One can see that this practice
affects the purchaser of paper-
backs and hardbounds who
might want to sell them later.
The crime comes in relation to
u really high quality hardbound
or paperback that is or a type
~that would be kept. This in~
eludes any number of antholo-
gies, science texts. history vol-
umes, and “table top” art
books.

The answer is simple. Put
the sticker on the inner tly
leaf. This is easily accessible
both while unpacking books
and while checking them out.
It offers the advantage of be
ing in a little noticed spot in
a hook, Once the book is pur-
chased the sticker would be in
a location that can be covered
by an "ex lihris."

SLOBS SMOKE GRASS

Compiled from ACP Dispatches
University of North Carolona,
Dec. 2t (ACP)—- “The hippies
are terribly, terribly innocent.
They could have inﬂuence, but
they were defeated by the in-
troduction of drugs."

Dr. Morris Lipton or North
Carolina Memorial Hospital,
who spent the summer in San
Francisco’s Haight—Ashbury dis-
trict, told a coffee-house au-
dience that the flower children
brought on their own destruc-
tion in the form of LSD.

Lipton characterized the hip-
pie movement as “a sweet,
laudable thing.” He called the
movement a reaction to the
materialism oi the Protestant
ethic and middle class values
The hippies, he said, are faced
with an acute conflict between
internal and external controls—
the demands of conscience and
those of society.

Discussing the physiological
effects of LSD, Lipton avowed:
“A! a chemical expert. i can
say that anyone who stays on
acid rain“ or five years ends up
in the nuthouse—penunnentiy."

LSD interferes with the trans-
mission of nervous impulses be-
tween nerve endings, distorts
the signals sent into the central
nervous system, and causes un»

natural responses, the psychia-
trist said.

Continual use, he explained,
ultimately affects the nervous
system‘s “wiring" and drug
users wind up having psyche-
delic experiences without taking
the drug.

Lipton added that drug users
often show schizoid tendencies.

“Chronic marijuana users
eventually become slobs, too,”
he added.

He said he had taken a trip
himself under laboratory coir
diliDnS.

“Oh, it was fun all right," he
commented. ‘l've had LSD and
undergone psychoanalysis. I
found the latter a more reward~
ing experience.”

Those of you who bemoan the fact that Grinnell hosts very
few genuinely formal events can rejoice. The greater portion of
this weekend will offer you a chance to unpack those cocktail
dresses delicately wrapped in tissue paper.

Besides that, guys who usually find it diiiicult to iabrlcato
suitable entertainment for dates on one of Gi‘innell’s notably stag-
nant weekends will discover that this North Campus Weekend will
proffer amusements diversified from Baroque to jazz music, from
candlelight in Cowles to red checked tablecloths in the Forum
Grill and Julie Christie in ARH.

A slight discrepancy in the promotion of this year's North
Campus Weekend reveals its actual misnomer; most of the social
events will be held on Central Campus.

Be assured, however, that given the chance to display her very
best iinery in the Grinnell tradition, one may find Central Campus
fashionably attired.

if you're longing for the atmosphere which one finds only in n
nightclub, Friday night may try you in South Lounge from 9 'til
midnight where an Old Town group, the Oscar Lindsay Trio, in
the Ramsey Lewis tradition will be performing for a “dithyramh”
ushering in the iormal weekend. The Trio, fresh tiom an engage-
ment at the Midas Touch in Chicago. should provide some fabuloul
evening entertainment,

Substituting for Booker T, and the MG: Saturday night will
be the fantastic rock group, the Ides of March. The Booker T.
Group, cancelled because oi the marriage oi their drummer, will
be here for a concert on the “lb of February,

For those of you who thrive on the old-fashioned movie date,
Friday night WIll also host the first showing of Billie Liar, a recent
movie starring Julie Christie. This intriguing flick will begin at a
pm in ARH and a repeat showing will be held Sunday at 9:30,

A formal candlelight dinner date in Cowles will initiate the
events of Saturday night. The steak dinner will be served formal-
ly from 6 to 6:45 pm. and is expected to end by 7: (it). Remember,
guys, that you must turn in meal tickets for you and your date to
your nail Social Chairmen. Lounge parties will be iound in every
hall on North Campus swinging imm 7 until it pan. accompanied
by open dorms from 8 to 10 p.m.

At 8 pm. the long-haired crowd will find the Chamhre Orchw
tra, the Grinnell College Choir and the Lenox Quartet presenting A
concert in Robert’s Theatre. The evening’s program will include
one of the Bradenburg Concern and a cnntata hy Purcell.

At 10 pm. couples can gyrate to the heat sound of the [den

TWO llIl SYSTEMS SEEN

BY DAVE RENAUD
S E: B Staff Writer

Contrary to popular belief,
The resident advisor (RA) sys-
tem at Grinnell College is not
one system, but two. The two
systems are run by two dir-
ierent people, Alice Low. dean
in women, and Eugene Thomp-
son, dean of men, with two difs
ferent ideas on what the system
is supposed to do.

A poster which was sent out
for recruitment purposes to col-
Ieges and universities in various
parts of the country reads. in
part:

“Responsibilities i n c l u d e
counseling or approximately
100 students, with special
emphasis on advising lresii-
men, and generally contrib-
uting tn the quality and so-
cial and academic life in the
residence halls in cooperation
with elected studentvgovem.
meat officers, house councils,
Ind the Dean of Men Ind
Dean of Women."

The poster goes on to say that
“In addition" the resident ad-
visors can be involved in ac-
ademic or admimstrative ac-
tivities of the college commun-
nity.

INTERPRETATION OF

DUTIES

John Martell, former RA ior
Cowles and Dibble, interpreted
lhis as meaning, “an adult in a
dorm for counseling."

Zelte Crawinrd, RA tor North
Younker, South Younker‘, and
Smith has the same view.
(Martell left at the end of last
semester, commenting: “theu~
reticaily it (the job) is interest-
ing, but the way it has turned
out, it isn’t.")

Myrna Aldrich, RA ior Cleve-
land and James. moreror-less
agrees with this. saying; “The
purpose of the RA system is to
have somebody here who is in-
terested in the students and
the campus.”

”To provide counseling,” iI
what Bette Davis, Loose RA,
thinks this clause means, "all
long as we recognize our own
limitations."

The RA for Langan. Gates
and Rawson, Joe Krausman,
thinks his job is to “keep the
boys from doing things like
breaking lamps and throwing
footballs through Windows,” as
well as “havmg people talk to
me.”

John Miller has an entirely
rliilerent interpletation or what
the clause means. He thinks
that "more than being an RA
my job is being an assistant in
cducation.” In other words he
summer: the “in addition”
clause of the poster to be more
important than the “responsibil—
Ities” clause.

Mary (“Suzie") Argentl and
Christie O’Loughlln, resident
advisors ior Hailles and Read
and Meals and Main, respec-
tively, go along with Dean Low
in taking the “responsibilities"
alause lor exactly what it says.

According to Dean Thompson,
however, the resident atlvisors
are “supposed to be there as a
non-student person in the
dorm." Their job, says Thomp-
'0", is to “get to know the stu-
dents." This is a duty that is
only implied by the poster.

Dean Low says that the RA}:

do not have any day-to-day
specific duties written down,
but there is “a general outline
ot what they are supposed to
do." Those duties are the ones
listed on the poster as “respon-
sibillties."

0n the other hand, Dean
Thompson says: “There are no
rules written down."

VARIED ORIENTATION

Before classes started this fall
and before the students arrived,
Dean Low had an orientation
for the women resident advis-
ors. During this orientation she
outlined what she wanted the
R.A.’s to accomplish she left
it up to the resident advisers
as to how they were to accom-
plish these ends, which were
the same nds stated in the
“responsib ties” Clause of the
poster.

During this time Dean Low
also told the RAJ! about the
Baffle Board. Theoretically one
or more girls on each ﬂoor of
each dorm meets with the
woman resident udvisor once I
week to report on how the ﬂoor
is coming along with its prob-
lems.

Dean Thompson had no orien-
tation for the men R.A.’s. When
asked if such an orientation
would have helped, he said:
“Maybe. When I interviewed
them I told them that their
ﬁrst job was in get to know as
many people as possible. They
were supposed to iniorm them-
selves about hall government.”

The men R.A.'s all agree that
an orientation would have
helped, even if all it involved
was telling them what they
were supposed to be doing.

HELP STUDENTS

All of the resident adviSDl‘s
said that a lot of students come
in to “chihchat,” in the case
of the girls, and “shoot the
bull,” in the case of the boys.
All except one, Joe Krausman,
said that they had helped stu‘
dents With emotional problems.
Krausman said, “Kids come to
me with money problems, girl
problems, and house problems.
They come in to ask‘me about
the army and they Just come in
to talk; but they don't come in
with emotional problems."

(Dean Thompson slutfed on
this remark by saying, Kraus-
man just isn’t the kind of guy
that admits he has helped kids
with emotional problems")

When asked what he looked
for in the hiring of these people,
Dean Thompson said: “All have
to have an academic job it they
are interested. Also they must
have the ability to live in a
dormitory." (John Martell lived
in a dorm ior one year and
Ll'links dorm life is Stupid.)

Dean Low looked lot girls
that “you can talk to easily.
Someone who is really interest-
ed in young people. I also looked
ior some kind of counseling in
the girls‘ background."

IMPROVEMENTS

All oi the resident advisors
had some ideas lor improving
the system. Zelte Crawford
thinks integrating the dorms
would help. Suzie Argenti. Bette
Davis. and Myrna Aldrich think
it would be a big improvement
ii the R.A..systems on North
and South, boyu and girls,

SCARLET AND BLACK

campuses worked closer to-
gether.

John Miller and Joe Kraus-
man would like to see a lull-
time facility member paid a
“couple oi grand" more to live
in the dorm.

John Martel] went one step
further and said that they
should hire psychologists for the
position.

Even the two people who are
in the position to do something
about improvement or the sys-
tem have suggestions.

Dean Low thinks: “The pro-
gram should work together and
there should be a combined
training program for both men
and women R.A.'s. It would
also help if a group at tipper-
classmen were set up to work
with the resident advisors."

Dean Thompson thinks: “We
should make sure the guys we
get are going to be interested
in talking with students about
problems~both house govem-
merit and academic. There has
got to be some kind a! formal

Thompson who hires the men

Grinnell as RAJK “is question-
able in a couple of cases."

There are, indeed. two dif-

this and wants something done
about it. The resident advisers
see this and want something
done about it. Dean Thompson
says: ”I don't think there are

INTERIM
SCRAPPED

SGA President Ric MacDow—
ell — representing the Interim
Committee — told the senate
Wednesday night that “there
won’t be an interim as such
next year."

MacDowell said the Idminis-
tration had decided not to con-
tinue the program, and he nt-
tributed Ihe end oi Interim to
poor attendance at event! and
luck of funds.

A Carnegie grant which had
ﬁnanced part of Interim events.
he said, had expired this year.
It costs around $10,000 to curry
an Interim, he added.

The cost was around 330 per
student this year, he guessed.

Interlm was “unbelievably
poorly Ittended,” the Interim
chairman concluded. “We had
580 students buck plus athletes
plus lhe seniors."

“We spent $400 to bring in
three speakers on minorities,”
he noted, ”and had about 80
people show up for it (Le. their
presentation).”

Mac Dowell also mentioned
that the College may usa
money formerly expended on
Interim for convocation-like ac-
tivities during the school year.

AFRO-AMERICANS:
IN TOWN. ON CAMPUS

By SUKI FOWLER I SUSAN HAMANN
sails Staff Writers

“Insults, rockthrowing, general disrespect and accosting oi
Negroes in the Grinnell Community." said Lou Kelly, Was the silly
ject of a meeting last Sunday night at Grinnell House.

The meeting was the culmination of Kelly’s so—iar unirllitlul
attempts to form an Afro-American group on campus.

it was attended by president Leggett, Dean s. Eugene Thomp-
son, Kelly, and other leaders or the Aim-American group mm the

college.

Townspeople who attended were Bill Weeks (High School Prim
cipal), Police Chiet Peters. Al Pinder (of the Grinnell Herald-Reg.
ister), and “Frosty" Mitchell (of KGRN).

Kelly explained that most or the meeting was spent in “con-
vincing the members or the town group that a Negro problem

existed in Grinnell.”

The problem comes mostly from persons under 25 who take
out their "boredom" by insulting _ physically and mentally —
members oi the Grinnell Community, especially Negro students,

states Kelly.

Kelly felt the need {or an AfroAmerican group ior seltrpreser-
vation has developed against the town's attitude of “rampant in-

action."

The group was formed last semester originally to participate
in the nation-Wide project of defining the role of the Negro in the
United States. They concluded that considerable alienation re-
sulted when the term “Black Power" was used too loosely in con-

nection with AimAmericanlsm.

, Defining “Black Power," Kelly says it suggests the “idea oi
self~respect oi the Negro as well as emphasizing tin appreciation

of the American Negro culture."

He observed that the Grinnell Negro is not really a part of the
subculture, because he can, Kelly said, partially escape through
his education. Still, Kelly said, the Grinnell Negro will have to do
considerable “soul searching" in deciding whether or not to ignorc
the problem: of ”inadequate housing. poor jobs, and inferior edit-
cntion which produce the Negro who is ashamed of his Negro cul.

The death of the policeman,
Kuba, took place when the cops
attacked the dorms.

According to the current issue
of The Movement, “there are
no windows on the side of the
building from which the police
attacked; therefore, a student's
bullet would have had to make
two right angles to hit a police-
man,"

“The accused are: Douglas
Wallace, who was already in
jail at the time of the murder;
Floyd Nichols and Charles Free-
man, who were on the olher side
of the city; Trazewell Franklin
and John Parker, who were in
bed when the police attacked."

INTRODUCING PAT OLIPHANT

By NEIL FISCHER

Pat Ollplnnt 10013 like the little penguin (or whatever it is)
that ornnlpresently can be iound making snide comments in the
corner or an Olipilant cartoon. ,. ,

The first time I snw hint waddiing around the DENVER
POST‘S news room, I knew exactly who he was.

I was I copyboy at the time, and the capyboys worked in n
narrow room lined with wail<to-wall ieletypes from sundry wire

services. It hadn‘t been but a

year since Oliphant had won

his Pulitzer Prize, and he must

‘have been feeling pretty pres-
‘ tlgious.

Rumor was rampant among
the stair — especially the copy-
buys.

“He comes in here and reads
a little wire copy. Gets him
ideas,” alleged one of my com-
rades.

“Then he goes into his office,
does his cartoon in live min-
utes, and stares at the wall for
the rest of the day. i seen him.
He‘s weird."

Well, he isn’t weird. really.
He's just good.

And alter looking for l car-
toonist on campus for over a
year and seeing none, i decided
to go prolcsslonal and buy him
(or my semester on the soil.
'The L05 ANGELES TIMES Syndicate sold him (that is, his

cartoons) to us, Ind I want you all to know he’s damn expensive.
it you scanned his cartoons this week, you know he's good, so
we won't go into that anymore.

- Ollphnnt was already it cartoonist of note when he moved from
South Australia to the United States in 1964. in 1958 he won one of
“IE top two prizes in London‘s “Great Challenge Editorial Cartoon
Competition," an international contest designed to find the lun-
niest editorial artist in the world. All Westem naiinns were rel)
resented in the competition, and Olipliant represented the ADE-
LAlDE (Australia) ADVERTISER

The 29-year~old artist replaced Paul Conrad as cartoonist-in-
residence at the DENVER (Colorado) POST in 1964. In 1966 he
won both the Pulitzer Prize and the Sigma Delta Chi award {or
editorial cartooning.

Olipham still retains his Australian accenl, but his point of
view is strictly American His cartoons are syndicated to over ion
newspapers across the u.sr Most journalists l’ve talked to think
he’s the host American cartoonist tor editorial work next to
Conrail."

conrad appears in THE DES MOINES REGISTER.

The hasis ct Ollphant‘s cartoon is, simply, humor. “In those
instances where a particularly grim subject might indicate a
straight approach," he believes, “the contrast that humor artortis
thrusts the message home with ircsh impact."

Take a look at the Oliphant editorial cartoons in this issue of
the Sim. And then make it a hahit to regulariy enjoy this bright
new work in the oldest college newspaper West of the Mississippi.

PARIETALS. HOURS ELSEWHERE

MINNEAPOLIS, Dec. 21
IACP) — Social regulations and
the philosophy behind them are
one target of the student power
movement, and some changes
can be attributed in part to the
activists, but others have wmex
solely by administrative decree
in recognition of the temper of
the times.

A freshman coed at a Minne-
sota college was required to
move into a dormitory even
though her home was a block
from the campus. _

At Texas Technological Unl-
versity, Lubbock, 34 male stu-
dents took to the courts to tight
a rule requiring them to live
on campus.

President Wilson H. Elkins
oi the University of Maryland
put his foot down on a recom-
mendation to close doors of stu-
dent rooms during legal visita-
tlons, saying the recommend-
ation “put sex overtones" on
coeducational activity.

Debate over open houses and
open doors is nothing new: it
has been several years now since
the Well - publicized case of the
male dorm resident at Yale who,
rebelling against a policy re-
quiring doors during visitation
to be open the width of a book,
substituted matchhooks for teXt<
books.

OPEN HOUSES, DOORS
since then, debate has been
sporadic but oiten intense. This
fall at the University 0! Call-
fornla, Berkeley, Dean oi Stu-
dents Alleigh Williams “extends
oil from two to ten the number
of residence room visits per-
mitted each month by members
of the opposite sex," according

to a Daily California report.

The extension was not greeted
as enthusiastically as might
have been expected, however.

It was coupled with stipula-
tions “that all guests be es-
corted upstairs by their hosts,
and that the doors to rooms oi

all participating students remain
wide open at all times."

The administration View on
open doors inevitably takes into
account the possibility that the
public would view such a policy
as encouragement of licentious-
ness.

CURFEWS CURBED

Michigan State University and
the University of Minnesota re-
cently eliminated curiews for
all dormitory women except
freshmen, who are generally
thought by administrators to re-
quire a period of adjustment be-
tween the assumed regulations
of home and the complete trees
dom of a no-hours policy.

Western Michigan University,
Kalamazoo, extended dorm ci05<
ing to 2 a.m. ior juniors and
seniors and began a senior wo-
men's hall with no hour restric-
tions. But despite the improve-
ment over the old system, the
Western Herald wasn’t satisfied.

The newspaper urged the uni<

varsity to follow Michigan
State's example.

Hours for senior women at
Wartburg College, Waverly, 1a.,
were liberalized by the lnitlation
of a key system for senior wo-
men but some vestages oi the
old system remained: disciplin<
ary probation (with no appeal)
for lending a key to an ineligi-
ble coed and a stiff $25 penalty
for losing the key.

Still other schools are pushing
for change.

At the University of North
Carolina, a referendum last
spring showed, the Daily "rot-
Heel said, that “a majority of
coeds here favor extension of
closing hours, elimination 0!
closing hours for seniors, libera
alization of the overnight sign-
out system [or girls who have
blanket parental permission,
and the option to live in off-
campus housing for coeds who
are either seniors or 21 years
old."

The Tar Heel suggested that

SEX OFF CAMPUS

A target at still other schools,
among them South Dakota State
University and North Texas
State University, is a policy pro-
hibiting students in oil-campus
apartments from having visitors
of the opposite sex.

And then there’s the question
of whether students should be
allowed to live in apartments
at all. Until recently, coeds at
the University of North Cares
lina were not permitted to [we
in apartments. NDW, Senior wo-
meo have that privilege.

PERMlSSION GRANTED

When students at Texas Tech
were denied permission to regis<
ter this fall because they were
not residents in the campus
housing, the University Daily
reported that they ﬁled an in-
junction against the university,
Claiming financial inability to
live in dormitories.

And alter Weeks of arbitra-
tion, the students succeeded in
getting a appeals system es-
tablished to consider such cases
and grant permission to live or:
campus in» some instances. .

“Much more is involved," the
Daily commented, “than the
right of students to live nit
campus this fall, as both side!
of the suit realize.”

“The case is one of nation
wide precedence and impor-
tance, affecting apartment owns
ers, school administrators and
bond holders in every city in
the nation with a college or
university campus."

BIBLE MORALS AT V. U.

At the Valparaiso Congress.
during which the students were
surprised by the announcement
that curiews for Senior women
would soon be abolished, Dean
of Students Luther Koepke ex-
plained the philosophy underly-
ing rules at Valparaiso.

Three kinds oi rules are em
forced, xoeploe said: “moral
rules from the Bible or from
God (teaching students Chris-
tian ethics is a v.u. objective).
civil rules which must be obeyed
as the edicts of authority, and
social rules enforced to lnsm
orderly living conditions.”

GRINNELL "66" — IN ”68"?

Publication of Henry Wil-

lege yearbook West of the Mis-
sissippi,” Grinnell College—1966,
has been delayed again.
Wilhelm, 24, a lornier Grin»
nell student and former editor
or the oilicial college Cyclone,
explained the new delay in a
letter to subscribers mailed a
low days ago. '
"when we last wrote you the
book was at a printer who had
agreed to do the job for us,"
Wilhelm said. “Subsequent to
that, a senior oiticer in the firm
decided that they would mt

print the book because," he
said, of ‘the book's past his»
wryr.”

“We have been told by the
(new) printer," he added, “that
the book will be completed to-
ward the end at February, so
we’ll pass that on to you.”

"But," he noted, “we teel
rather embarrassed to guaran-
tee anything, so we can’t pro-
mise that date tor sure.”

College records, however, did
not indicate that Chapman was

“At this point the type has
been set and prooled, and the

Wilhelm explained in the letter.
“The very same double-impres-
sion printing process is being
used as we previously adver-
tised. The new printer is chart
ing somewhat more; (The cost
of the book has reached tour

“roughly 750, I'd say."

“We've still got a long way
to go to break even," he con-
eluded.

ADMISSIONS BOOK STYMIEI]

By DIANA SALURI

Limited student response has
temporarily halted work on the
proposed student-written ad.
missions booklet. Publication
will not be in time tor this year’s
prospective students as was
originally planned.

The Student Senate Admis~
sions Committee, sponsors of
the project, received only lit-
teen contributions in response
to a school-wide soliciting cam-
paign at the end of last semes-
ter.

According to committee chair-
man Doug Tolletson, the con-
tributions were lacking in varie.
ty as well as in number.

“Many ot the topics students
chose to write on," he com-
mented, “were quite similar.
Because we didn't get the com-
prehensiveness we teel is neces-
aary to represent all aspects
oi Grinnell, we don't feel that
we should rush into putting I
book together right away.”

Plans (or a student - written
admissions guide lor prospeo
tives were ﬁrst made after mem-
bers oi the committee studied
a similar publication put
out by Carleton College. The
project is backed ﬁnancially by
the admissions office budget

and subject to the review of the
Faculty Committee on Admins
rions.

Dale Terry, director of ads
missions, thought the book would
be a valuable supplement to the
regular catalogue.”

Toilefsun sees three possible
alternatives for the tuiure at
the booklet: the committee will
again solicit contributions at
large, assign specitic contribu-
tions, or appoint a single author
for the book.

In addition to publishing an
admissions guide, the Student
Admissions Committee has tall}
en over the job of arranging
student contacts with prospec-
tives over Christmas vacation,
They have also been gathering
application terms and admis.
sions data irom other mllegel
tor a comparative study or ad-
missions procedures.

Tolleison defines ihe main goal
at the oommittee as being “tho
attraction or topnotch studento
by presenting the interesting!
creative and exciting aspects

Other members of the come
mittee are Sara Hartman, Terry
Mossholder, P e a r l Kadota,

and David Cavander.

 

doubt that you feel as grieved
about this delay as we do.”
HISTORY OF BOOK

Grinnell College — 1966 was
originally going to be the ol-
ticial college yearbook tor that
year. Wilhelm and co-editor
John Phillips, 21, formerly of
Algona, 1a., mailed the manu-
script to its ﬁrst printer, a ﬁrm
in Hannibal, Mo., last April—
long after the normal publica-
tion (late.

The printers mailed it back to
Grinnell, telling the college they
would only publish it it they re-
ceived a hard and last releaso
irom any legal responsibility
irom Grinnell College.

The book, the llrst printer

suggested, “was a major do-
parture from what is normally

found in a a college yearbook."

The book allegedly contained
pictures of a marijuana party
on campus, a male and temalo
student leaving n local motel
together, and coeducational
beer blast.

“There weren’t any obscenq
pictures,” Wilhelm told the As.
sociated Press last May, "N
nudes or anything like that.

John F. Bierman, the attorney
lor Grinnell College said h.
counted "at least 30 instance!
oi potential libel" in the year-
book.

Both Wilhelm and Phillips, t
book‘s editors, ﬂunked out o
Grinnell. The College refused l
publish “Grinnell College—1m,
and Wilhelm decided to Mil.
it published himself.

Greenfield Gamble: For Grade

LOGICAL BLACKJACK

BY DAVE HORWA‘TT
S & B staff Writer

in the final rush of last
lemester when most students
were writing two papers a
night, Tom Greenfield, North
Younker sophomore, was sit-
ting in a dimly lit backmom
playing blackjack.

Greenfield was fulfilling an
assignment in Logic (Phiios
ophy 121).

The professor of the course,
John Worley, gave students the
opportunity to do either an
hourly, or a paper or proiect
dealing with some facet of logic.
Greenfield chose to give a dem-
onstration of a winning strategy
in the game of blackjack.

Several years ago Greenfield
read about Edward 0. Thorpe, a
Professor of Mathematics at the
University of California, who
with the aid of a computer, de-
veloped a system of winning at
blackjack using the casino rules
at Las Vegas,

Thorpe published a book in
1962—13er The Dealer which
advanced several schemes for
coming out ahead in betting on
"twenty-one".

The book was so successful
that Las Vegas gambling houses
made rule changes to try to
compensate.

Greenfield had trouble finding
a copy of Thorpe's book, but
finally got one mailed to him
from a Chicago bookstore. He
selected the ”count-ten” system
for his demonstration.

The game of Blackjack works
like this:

The dealer deals two card:
to himself and to each of the
other players. Usually the deal-
er has one card showing and
the other face down, or “in the
hole." The player receives both
cards down.

Every card has a numerical
value; face cards a value of
ten; the Ace a value of one or
eleven (at the player's discre-
tion); and other cards have
their face value.

the pin or is to obtain a total
from his cards that is greater
than the dealer's, while not cite
ceeding twenty—one—When he's
“busted”.

An Ace and a Card valued at
ten give the player a “natural
blackjack”. If the player is
dealt a pair then he may play
each card as a separate hand.
Betting can vary from a 25s
minimum to $150. The player
is betting on what he thinks his
advantage is against the dealer.

Thorpe simply enumerate;
methods for examining the
hands of the player and dealer.
Working with probabilities gives
the player a strategy of betting
that will bring him out ahead
over a period of time—any<
where from one to ten percent
ahead.

Essentially the ten count sys<
tem has the player count the
number of tens (there are SIX-
tieen in a full deck,) and non-
tens from cards shown.

As the ratio of non-tens to tens
decreases, the player's chance:
increase.

Thorpe used his ten count
method in Nevada. Working
with 510,000 capital loaned by
two speculative millionaires
Thorpe doubled the capital otter
thirty hours of conservativt
betting.

Tom Greenfield used I verv
rion oi the ten count strategy
from .Bent The .Dealer.. He
played a total of 346 hands us~
ing a minimum bet of 35 and a
maximum of :25. Out of a hypo-
thetical 52.340 bet. Greenfield
won $240 or better than ten per-
cent profit.

However Greenfield only
played about 15 hands with
Worley, which were not enough
to show the advantage of the
player with the Thorpe system.
in the half hour game Green-
field came out a few dollars be-
hind on the betting.

Worley commented on Greeni
field’s brief demonstration. “it’s

PANCAKE PROTEST

SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 11
(LNS) — Former Stanford Stu-
dent Body President Dave Hal'-
ris led 400 demonstrators this
morning through his second re~
fusal of induction and a pan-
cake breakfast in Provo Park,
Berkeley.

Harris arrived for induction
on a bus at 6' 15 a.rn. to meet
his supporters, all in a cheery
mood, and an army of the press

About the men facing induc-
tion, he said, “These cats are
not here because they want to
be; they’re here because they're
afraid. This whole society has
made Ulem afraid for the last
19 years.” He added, “Let them
do what they want with my
body. They can't take my
mind."

Ripping up his induction pa-
pers, Harris said, “Those people
I was supposed to kill and those
people going into the army and
all oi you are my brothers . . .
i call on every person registered
with the SS system to refuse to
cooperate with that system;
those who have not registered
to refuse to register; those in
the Army to refuse to cooper-
ate."

At the pancake gig, Hester

GERMAN RADICAL
UNIVERSITIES

BERLIN (CPS)—The paradox
of being a “radical Student" is
that you have to belong to a
university, which almost auto.
maticaliy makes you un-radical.
’At the same time, the univei‘u
lity is considered the ideal
place to “radicaliz " others.

This paradox has been es-
pecially numbing in Germany,
whose public is still going
through a thank-God-we’re-not-
extremist—any-more stage. Most
people are scared to death of
radicalism on the right or left,
Including most of the faculty
In even the most “progressive"
universities.

Until recently, the students
thought the Free University of
Berlin would be a good comprm
miss. The teachers were young

and internationally recruited,

the students were shrewd, and

there was plenty of money.
But it wasn't good enough.

Just over two months ago
2,000 Free University students
met in the Auditorium Main
imum on its Dahlcm campus
to begin a “Critical University"
Io fill what they called the “pm
Iitical vacuum” In German stu-
dent life and to get out of the
“radical student" paradox.

The Critical University (CU)
Is a “concrete utopia to give
continuing and relevant political
Instruction," according to the
University of Hamburg student
newspaper, Auditorium. The
magazine Der Spiegel describes
it as “a mixture of Marx, Mao
and Marouse.”

SCARLET AND BLACK

Herbert Marcuse is the Ger-
man-born philosopher who says
that a society devoted to liber-
alism—free and reasoned do
hate, “equal time” for opposing
sides—can never undergo rad-
ical change and has no place
for radical solutions. In this
way, he argues, the “liberal"
society is more suffocating than
the “conservative” one.

The (CU) is really a politicah
l oriented Free University.

rolessors are invited into
classes as participants rather
than lecturers. The students
control the curriculum and con-
tent. Courses have names like
“History of Revolution" and
“Advertising and Educational
Reform."

There are no degrees, and the
students contribute what they
can to keep it going.

The Critical University of
Berlin didn't so much grow out
of a desire for student power
as a desire to make radicals
—the paradox once again, it

wasn't that the established Gen
man universities had too much
powerino one interested in pnl-
ltics took them too seriously—
but that radicals can't grow in a
seedbed of liberalism.

The issues confronting the
German radicals are much the
same as those In Americal the
overriding concern is the rise
of the military-industrial oom-
plex. To investigate the bur-
geonlng power in the Generals
in Germany, the CU in Ham-
burg recently invited “Der
Spiegel” military editor Carl-
Gideon Von Claet‘ to a “class“
and mercilessly pumped him
for Information on (he’stnio-
tum of Germany‘s Armed
Forces and their covert and
overt relations with German
businessmen.

The CU seems to be more an
anarchist organization than any
kind of hard-line socialist or
communist one, Certainly there
are communists in it, and
everyone says he's a socialistl

but there is more a commit-
ment to "general revolution"
than to something like the spa-
cifiu overthrow of Germany‘s
government.

American radicals differ from
their European counterparts in
this respecti they are much
more mncemed with the elim-
ination—one way or another—
of the Johnson government.

(of course, you could say that
they are brothers-under-thin
suds in a way, since the Euros
pean radicals would like to get
rid of the Johnson government
too.)

The Idea of the Critical or
Counter-University has been
adopted in some form in Berlin,
Muenster, Frankfurt, Hamburg,
Main: and Heidelberg in Ger.
many, as well as in Amsterdam
and London, The idea is expects
ed to blossom in other Euro<
pean cities, and Is therefore
certain to guarantee broad-
based “student power" all over
the continent,

Talk to a young French left-
Ist today and he'll tell you that
France is the only country with
a truly "matuie left.“

Talk to a journalist, some
what older and more skeptical,
and he’ll tell you sadly, "La
France, helas, c'est la Sulsse”
— that is, it has no politics at
all.

And to a young American
leftist, who is in no position to
boast of his country’s radical
tradition, what the French
choose to call mature politics
often seems to be more rightly
dulled “senile."

The left finds Itself in a pe-
culiarly ambivalent position
under do Gaulle. They may
dislike the imperial person-
ality of “le grand Charles,"
but they filld that his nine-
teenth . century notions of
French empire sometimes
make for good politics, at least
abroad. He Is, after all, they
tell you, the only Western lead-
er to give the United States a
little of what it deserves, His
overt opposition to the Vietnam
war, for example, and his
condemnation of israei in the
lune sixday war winclde very
well with the views of many on
the French lefti As a result,
do Gaulle's enlightened foreign
policy creates an Internal po-
lltical atmosphere conducive to
leftist anti-war activity.

De GAULLE DOMINATES

At the same time, however,
'de Gaulle’s overwhelming dom-
Inance in French politics has
made opposition and resistance
into a game and a pose more
than an effective political life.
Be Gaulle's domestic policies
lerve to enhance the status of
private capitalism, and do less
than nothing to Change the rig-
id and hierarchical structure

gain scholarships to the uni-
versities. in a country with
limited resources, an aggres-
sive policy abroad is gotten at
the price of repressive politics
at home,

The stagnancy and impotence
of the left is due in part to the
domineering presence of the
French Communist Party
(PCF), a bureaucracy of nine
million members whose aspira<
tions are only a little more
revolutionary than those of
Lyndon Johnson's Democratic
Party. As the largest function.
ing political party In France,
the PCF dominates activity on
the left; and because of Its
conservatism, It seldom pre‘
sents a significant challenge to
the fundamental political and
social structure of the country.
Its problems are compounded
by its rigid ideological stance
and its schizophrenic political
personality. 0 win g loyalties
culturally to France, but doc-
trinally to the soviet Union, the
PCF defines itself by taking pi»
sitions consistently contrary to
those of the Gaullist govern-
ment. Defenders of the Com-
munist Party point out, how-
ever, that if the PCF were any
more revolutionary, it would
lose three-quarters of its mem<
bership.

There is also a Federation of
the Left (Federation de la
Gauche), an amalgam of
smaller leftist parties and {ac-
tions including several varie-
ties oi socialism.

But the Federation is unfor-
tunately so deeply men by in-
ternal disputes that its public
face is hesitant and tentative
at best.

i was present In Nantes dur<
ing a one-day, nation-wide gen<
eral strike against the govern.
ment in mid-December. Called
by the Confederation Genel'alel
ties Travailleurs and other mas
jar labor unions (principally
Communist), the strike was
given advance publicity in all

French newspapers with the
matter-ef—factness of a notice of
work stoppage due to oecnical
difﬁculties.

in Nantes, the strike began
with a demonstration in a public
square at ten o’clock in the
morning. Representatives of
each union paraded before the
microphone, demanding higher
salaries and a larger share at
the national wealth, while a few
hundred workers stood by talk-
ing idly among themselves, and
a few hundred university stu-
dents busled themselves with
their revolutionary banners. At
10:30 the microphone went dead
(apparently the strike had
reached the electric workers as
well).

As we began to march, stu<
dents hoisted their banners and
began a chorus of the Commur
nist Internationale; the workers
grabbed their bicycles and
mopeds and folowed alongside.
There were no bystanders to be
seen; most merchants had tak-
en a one~day holiday, an extend-
ed weekend. In Neighborhood
banks, tellers joked to one an-
other that they would run out
of candles if the electrical work
ers kept striking so often.

“WORKERS AND
STUDENTS UNITE"

Events did not go according
to plan. As we approached the
Prefecture, where our demands
were to be presented to the ap-
propriate authorities, titers en-
sued a huddled conference at
the front of the marching col.
umn among the union leaders.
The march proceeded past the
Prefecture, slowed for an ill-
stant hesitantly, then moved on
and turned up a narrow side
street. The svudents were dis-
mayed, outraged; they shouted
after the laborers, “Workers
with students, pulled together!"
The workers‘ contingent disap-
peared around a corner, Be<
wildered and indignant, Ihe stu-
dents returned to the Prelim"
lure, chanted slogans for sev-

eral minutes in front of two
vaguely amused gendarntes
(“More scholarshipsl") and

disbanded. As we made our
way back to the snack bar to
eat a late breakfast, one stu-
dent lnmented that his banner
was beginning to lose its color,
after so many rainy - day
marches.

Such are the maladies of a
Left so profoundly institutional-
ized that it has lost its sense
of urgency, a Left so rigidly
ideological and traditional that
it has lost all touch with chang-
ing political and social condi-
tions, The notion of “lnevltabil-
ity" in classical Marxism has
led many students to believe
that the great proletarian NW
olution will come of its own am
cord; that It is consequently
sufficient simply to “go
through the motions" of pro
testing.

it is also very fashionable to
be a leftist, even if one's con-
victions are more rhetorical
that real. “Being left in
French universities is a way or
testifying to your intelligence,"
explains one student with
gentle sarcasm.

LES CHINOIS
AND TKOTSKYISTS

There are, fortunately, par-
ties other than the Patti Conl-
muniste Francais in the French
Left. “Les cliiiiois,” the Mao~
lsts, have become very numen
bus in recent years, and often
engage in pitch battles with
Commiinist- Party members at
public demonstrations. There
occasional eccentrics are sat-
ii-izcd in a recent film by Jean‘
Luc Goddard, “La Cliiiioise,"
and he has since been dilly
branded a “reactionary.”

The rotskyists are also eX<
perlencing a great revival of
late, and their literature can be
distinguished from that of the
PCP by both its militant rhe-
toric and its urgent calls for

cal differences over coffee in

Those French leftists with
whom I spoke were surprising
ly charitable towards the Ameri-
can left, though condescending.
We are very energetic, they say,
but still very immature: we lack'
both numbers and institutional
structures (parties). Without the
discipline organization of a pap
ty, they argue, we can never
hope to confront and replace
institutionalized power as it ex-
ists. ideologically, we are “un-
sophisticated;” we have still
not grasped the essential notion
that the revolution will come
from the workers, and from no-
where else. it is for that rea.
son that they give far greater
credence to the black movement
In the United States than to the
white, White middle~ciass stu<
dents have too great it stake in
the power structure to become
truly revolutionary. What we
have neglected is the latent dis<
content of the farmer and lac-
tory laborer. While that may be
so, it seems unlikely that an
American revolution will de-
velop along classic Marxist
lines, given the political history
of the American labor muve<
merit.

The question OI Student access
to FM radios was brought up
two years ago when the idea of
the present campus radio was
germinated. Students were
pulled on their access to FM
radios,

Roughly 25 per cent of the
student body did not own, or
have access to someone who
owned an FM radio.

Cloud says that the radio
heads are planning to supply at
cost AMAFMVAFC radios to stu<
dents. The cheapest purchase
price for such a radio is esti-
mated at Sis.

initiated by station manager
Armajani two years ago, the
present radio has suffered many
setbacks. Starting with its sup-
posed formationhy SGA in
1566, many big efforts such as
Convocation have taken pre-
cedence with the administration.
Even after soA agreed to fi-
ance the idea, the administra-
tion did not seem to approve,
Armajani indicated before an
open Senate meeting in Novem-
her.

It was not until the end at
Convocation in November, notes
Cloud, that the administration
could devote “full efforts” to
the formation of the amorphous
campus radio station.

At the Open SGA meeting that
Armajani spoke at, he had ex-
plained the board’s en masse
resignations pro—dated January
3. If the radio were operating
by then, he had explained, the
resignations would be with.
drawn. Otherwise Armajani
said he’d reorganize the staff
when the radio would begin op
eration.

The Executive Board, all ex-
cept Program Director Craig
Allin, IS still intact, Allin re—
signed at finals time last so-
mester. The present staff of

Over The Border

KAMP IN GANADA

By JEAN VANDERVODRT
0f the 5&3’5 Chicago Bureau

CHICAGO — Canadian radio
greets newcomers warmly.

“There are more people com-
ing into Canada than leaving it.
We welcome these young people
as Canada‘s new life blood,"
broadcasts declare.

Dick Kamp, Grinnell sopho<
more from West Norris Hall,
spent several days during Christ-
mas in Toronto, Canada, with
a group of draft-dodgers. Kemp
disparages Canada’s optimistic
welcome to their “new life
blood."

Canadian resistance centers
report that a minimum of 2,000
American draft-dodgers to a
possible 7,00" are in Canada
now. The drait age Americans
who leave to escape the 05.
perhaps as much as the army
find easy sanctuary, sponsors,
and centers to help locate lodg»
ing and employment there.

The resisters Kamp met could
Live with their situation no bet-
ter In Canada than in the U.
he opined in an interview when
he returned to his home in Chi-
cago atter the trip.

An overcrowded, run-down
house was Kamp’s residence
while in Toronto. A resistor
from New York rented it and
eight others usually stayed
there; three or four who helped
pay rent and three or four who
crashed.

"Only one had a job," Kamp
said. "He worked in a factory."

“They can get jobs pretty
easily, but they don’t have much
ambition at all.”

Kainp along with two Detroit
acquaintances traveled from
there to Toronto. One of the De-
troit men had spent 17 months
in the army.

He was on leave now because
he had chased his barracks
mates out at gunpoint and swal-
lowed an overdose of sleeping
pills when he learned he was
being sent to Vietnam.

The hostility, the extreme
apathy characterized the con-
fusion and fruslratiolt of the re-
sisters for Kamp. The ones who
were running from the dratt,
from the us. government and
who didn’t really think beyond
that were the ones who didn't
do well, he said.

“The ones who have done
well are artists, people who
planned to go to school before
they went, or people skilled in
a trade."

The majority of the resisters

have not yet broken away from
the United States, Kamp thought.

“An American kid in Canada
is not concerned about Canada,
He knows about 50 per cent as
much about Canada as about
the U.S."

“Their friends are in the 11.5.
One had a girl friend in New
York; one had a girl friend in
Detroit, I think, They didn’t
know anyone there. "

Trips back over are the big
thing. "One deserter from the
army — he was a speed-head4
boasted that he had gone over
the border 7 times (at Windsor
—it’s not hard them)."

“He would leave when the
FBI got on to him. They came
in the front door and he left by
the back.”

While some resistors just
exist, others become gang-ho
Canada, Dick observed. They
idealize Canada at the expense
of the United Slates.

"They are becoming Cana-
dian nationals. They don’t rear
lize some things. America al-
most necessarily has a totali.
tarian son of government while
Canada Is small and the govern-
ment doesn’t have to be so com-
plete ~ there’s sort of a pro
vincialism about it.”

“They don’t recognize that
Canadian industry is an exiew
sion of the United States.
Canada is just one more pawn
in the countervailing power
structures and it acts as a
pawn."

It isn’t a new idyllic life they
are starting, Kamp decided.
They carry over their old lite
so much it deadens the new.
“Some of them were Southern,"
Kamp said, “A Negro guy want-
ed to stay at the house, but
when they found out that ha
didn‘t have any money, they
were very condescending. That’s
what got me; they were still
being Americans."

Would he go?

“At least i can think serious-
Iy about it now, i wouldn‘t go
as an American nalional."

One who went was John

Well, welii We ﬁnally made it back from Christmas vacation
and the awful boredom which goes with a month of separation
from our natural environment has been supplanted by eager an-
ticipation of coming events. Now that we are free to resume our
activities. I. M. sports once again leap to the ioreiront of campus
thought.

The last sport to be contested was badminton which was held
just before Christmas. Brent Dubach supplanted Phil Woodward
as the singles champion While a team from Smith took the doubles
trophy. Dibble took first handily to become the first hall this year
to capture two team trophies.

Basketball now moves to the center stage and the season
promises to be one of the most bitterly contested in recent history
(but, at the same time, in the spirit of goodwill and gamesman-
Ihi ).

GOLFERS JUDGED.
0N CLOSED CIRCUIT

By ADRIENNE LEMMONS

Grinneil's golfers are on television. Closed—circuit, that is.

Coach Edd Bowers, using videotape experimentally as a
teaching device, found it effective in showing students what's
wrong (or right) with their teeing techniques.

“In football coaching, television tapes are more economical
than the movies currently in use,” Bowers said. When movies
outlive their usefulness, he added, nothing can be done with the
old film. TV tapes, on the other hand, can be erased and reused,
he said.

The TV equipment, which includes a camera and a monitor
set, was lent to Bowers by Ray Slanderwick. a 1952 alumnus
who played iontball and basketball under coach John A. Ptitsch.

Standerwick, now living in Grinnell, sells classroom furnish—
Lngs, including television sets designed for educational use.

Bowers was not fully satisﬁed with the equipment models be
used Though he obtained “excellent” results using it with his
golf class, he found that football pictures were somewhat unclear.
“Besides," he said, he was unable “to replay the tapes in slow
motion, and this proved to be a major drawback."

Bowers is keeping his eyes open for improvements which will
provide clearer photographs and enable him to use slow motion.
Such a machine, he said, would cost about $2500, while the one
he now uses sells for around $1500.

it might be a good idea, he suggested, for the college to boy
its own closed-Circuit. Available on a school-wide basis, it could
be useful in several other departments in addition to athletics,
Bowers said

”There will always be the problem, of course, of athletes
who would rather be TV comedians,” stated the Grinnell coach.
"Instead at concentrating on their swings or their passes, some
will prefer to clown for the beneiit of whoever might be watch-
Ing.”

But videotape, at least, can always be erasedl he concluded.

CAGER
WRAP-UP

By JEFF SCHECKTER

The Grinnell basketball team
has only won one of its last
eight ball games, but things are
looking up for the Pioneer team.

The Scarlet and Black lost

games at the University of Chi-
cago's Holiday Tournament. in
the iirst game, Grinnell lost to
Colorado College, 81-76.

Fifty-five percent shooting
gave the Pioneers a 45-39 half-
time lead but they only shot
29 percent in the second half.

Terry Holloway had 17 or his
21 points in the first half, Thor
Evenson had 10 of 16 and Mike
Schwartz had 10 of 11L Colorado

ures with 22, 13, 12 and 18.

The second game saw the
Siwashers Ill Knox beat the
Pioneers 9565. The Knox team
had a 45-30 lead at the hallway
point and then uutshot Grinneu
50-35.

only Thor Evenson (21 points)
and Mike Schwartz (19) shot lit
the double iigures, while tour

halves and Monmouth set the
Pioneers back 9W on January
6, out-rebounding them 5337.

The Grinnell team’s ﬁnest
hour so far occurred on January
12 when it pulled what can only
be called a surprise upset over
Carleton, 65-64. A 35 foot jump
shot by Mike Schwartz in the
last few seconds won the game
after the Pioneers had trailed
by as much as 15 points in the
second half.

Down by 15 early in the secs
0nd half, the Scarlet and Black
battled back to 48—46 on a basket
by Roger Able with nine min-
utes to play. Two more baskets
