Professor Burma Resigns Posi'l'ion
To Accep’i Job a+ California College

Dr. John H, Burma, Leland
Professor oi Sociology at Grinnell
College, has resigned to accept
a position in Caliiornia.

Dr, Burma came to Grinnell
in 1941 as an instructor and sole
member oi the Sociology
Department Since that time the
Sociology Department has grown
into the department oi Sociology
and Anthropology, and iinally
divided into two departments of
four and three members. During
most oi this period Proiessor
Burma was Chairman of the
Sociology Department and oi the
joint department. He also served
several times as Divisional
Chairman and as a member of
the Executive Council. as College
Marshall, and on numerous
college committees

During his tenure at Grinnell,
Dr. Burma authored or C0-

monographs, and approximately
fifty articles. His latest book, to

Dr. Burma expressed much
ambivalence in leaving Grinnell

Senators Cohen and Ward

Speak on Campus Affairs

Following their recent election
to the Senate, Alan Cohen and
Johanna Ward were interviewed
by the 5&3 to determine why
they ran. what they thought of
the Senate, and where they
thought the Senate should be

. heading,

Alan Cohen: ”I originally ran
because I thought the Senate had
been handling only small ad-
ministrative matters. Students
would ask what the Senate has
done, and the answer would be
nothing, All they had done was
give out money and pass a few
resolutions.

“i want the Senate to address
itself to the things that are
bothering students, I believe that
students are worried about the
academic situation: require-
ments. the possibility oi optional
grades, relevance of courses, and
so on, Last week three new
Senate committees were formed
anti live more became Senate
committees. They cover such
areas as requirements, ireshman
year, and the dormitories. The
Senate must act on the recom-
mendations of these com-
mittees."

”Another problem is com~
munication between Senators
and halls, Each senator is
responsible to two or three halls.
but they rarely meet with these
halls, Senators should provide
leadership to mobilize student
support ior issues. They also
shouldsolicilStudentopinions."

”l uni-kin! nit the Student

Position Paper 7 I’m definitely
in favor of it,” Alan finished his
interview with a harsh blast at
the S&B's anti»Senate editorial
(See last Week’s “Letters to the
Editors" tor other Senate opinion
on the editorial).

Johanna Ward: “Before this
year i heard more about the
Senate than lknew about it, Last
year pcoplc didn‘t think it was
doing anything or could do
anything. Havtng sat in on the
Student Position Paper. I've
found out that the Senate is the
best place for student opinion to
be heard.”

“I’d like to see the Senate at-
tempt to activate the student
body and keep it informed — like
about the Senate Position Paper.
One of the biggest faults of the
Senate in die past is it lack of
communication with students. If
they don’t know what‘s going on.
they can’t be interested! ”

“I'd like to see the entire
student body 7 Senate, Council
of House Presidents, Association
of Women Students 7 work on
developing this fine report we’re
supposed to have with the
faculty.”

“1 support the Student Position
Paper. but there’s a lot oi iaculty
opposition to it. it's an idealistic
paper. To get what we want, we
have to spend a lot of time to
fill positions adequately.”

“I think the drug issue 7 the
school's policy on drugs 7 is one
of the most important issues on
tuil"i)\l$

College, for which he expressed
great aiiection, respect and
loyalty. He also expressed his
friendship with, and well wishes
and respect ior, the College
administration and all the
members oi his Department.
“Tile College has been good to
us. especially in the friendships
we have established. and we will
never target it or them." Mrs.
Dorothy Burma was iormerly
Chairman of the Women's
Physical Education Department.
Acting Dean of Women one year,
and several times Social
Chairman of the faculty College
Club,

Professor Burma has accepted
a position as Professor of
Sociology at California State
Polytechnic College, a rapidly
growing state school with 7,500
students, located at Pomona,
California,
miles irom Los Angeles. He will
begin his duties with the summer
quarter in June. The couple will
reSide in Claremont, California.

Panthers Speak

A birthday party ior Huey P.
Newton. the Black Panther
Party‘s jailed Minister of
Defense, was held Saturday
aiternoon, February 14, in the
South Lounge. Featured events
were a speech by E. c. Smith,
Deputy Minister oi information
[or the Des Moines branch of the
Black Panther Party, and a docu7
mentary film of Bobby Seale in
prison.

E. C. Smith discussed the his-
tory of the Black Panther Party,
its ten-point program, the repres-
sion oithe party by the Establish
merit, and other topics pertaining
to the black liberation struggle.

As enunciated by Smith, the
(1) com-
niunity control. (2) iull employ-
mcnt (3) an end to capitalism
and imperialism, (4) decent
housing, 15) true, relevant educa-
tion, (6) no military service for
black people, (7) an end to police-
brutality and murder of black
people, (St the release of all black
prisoners, (9) black juries for

black defendants, and (10) a UN-
supervised plcbescite among
blacks to determine their
national destiny,

Among E C Smith's points
were the following: “The Party
is not racist We're notjust going
to kill the white pigs, That‘s a
lie. We’re going to kill the black
ones too because they’re
making life miserable in the
community,"

“They are trying to either
minate the Panthers not because
they have guns 7 no, niggers
have had guns beiore — but
because they have politics, We’re
talking about people organizing
to overthrow the system. We’re
talking about revolution."

Mary Rehm addressed herself
both to the general struggle and
to the plight of Huey P. Newton.
“The three levels oi oppression
are the demagogic politician, the
avaricious businessman, and the
pig-cop on the street."

We note the appearance of High and Mighty with
a certain amount of admiration. It is no easy matter
to produce a newspaper», especially when you are forced
to begin at the beginning. We hope that you choose
to continue what must he a difficult effort.

Clearly, there is room for more than one newspaper
on this campus. We are pleased that you have chosen
a territory which is, by nature, out of our range. The
establishment press, as you might call us, has certain
local responsibilities. And, in our more buoyant mo-
ments, we feel that the students at Grinnell deserve
something in addition to our much maligned editorial
conservatism.

We hear that you have requested a loan (or is it a
gift?) from the Senate. It would be sad if you chose
to give up a completely independent publication and
placed yourself in a precarious legal position, in ex-
change for a little security. If you did get money from
the Senate, would you be willing to abide by the regu-
lations of the Student Publications Committee? The
58:13 cannot be independent for technical reasons, which
you, no doubt, understand.

It is obvious to everyone that, to say the least, our
political and editorial principles are very far from
yours. But isn’t there some common ground between
us? You have apparently decided, unlike the editors
of Pterodactyl, that there are more important things
to do than to shock people or to make them cringe.
Are we wrong in this assumption?

We have no illusions about a conciliation or coalition
between us. That would only serve to compromise your
principles as well as ours. We think, though, that it
is possible for us to treat each other with respect, and,
recognizing that we are fallible men, still to act ‘honor~
ably and decently. For the present, we fight with words.
It may be the case, however, that, according to t!“
logic of human associations, rational discourse will
give way to impassioned rhetoric which will lead to
forceful action, We fear the day when we shall face
each other, fighting for opposite principle, with weapons
more deadly than words. Until that day comes, write
on, broﬂaers.

To the Editor:

In what is rapidly becoming a
tradition, I find it necessary to
correct some stated “fact”, in-
sinuations, and innuendos in last
week’s 5&3.

The “tradition” to which I am
referring is that of correcting the
numerous mistakes, half-truths,
and outright misconceptions con-
tained in this semester's 5&3, It
seems the “Letters to the Editor”
columns have had to fulfill this
function, and not a week passes
without the previous week’s 5&3
being substantially corrected.

I quote a letter to the editor

in lastweek's issue:
"‘We'd like to begin by re
marking about the general‘ re-
sponsibility of the editorial policy
of the 8&8 Since it has changed
hands. Your first editorial was
written without [actual knowl-
edge oi the position paper and
the progress the steering com
mittee had made in negotiating
with the faculty. As far as we
are able to ascertain, neither of
the editors has ever attended a
women's liberation meeting as
was demonstrated by the lack oi
insight in your second editorial.
Your third editorlal .7 and here
again we have never noticed your
faces at a senate meeting —— is
also a credit to your irresponsible
journalism. To put it bluntly, you
don't know what you're talking
about."

The writer of your fourth
editorial had even less idea of
what he was talking about. The
editorial states, “Bruce Nissen
has said that he and his friends
are ‘working tor a society that’s
above freedom 01 speech.’ “ This
statement is an outright lie I
have never made that statement;
I’m not even sure what it could
mean, and I certainly am not its
author Messrs, Fulton and
Gerson are to be thanked for their
s|rcnuous efforts to check with

either me or l-Ienry Wilhelm
about the veracity of this so-
called “quote.” Even Henry (who
apparently thought the ”quote"
up), admitted that it wasn’t a

genuine quote. However, he felt -

it cimveyed the intention or the
spirit oi my position, so it ap-
peared on his Plerodactyl with»
drawal. I laughed when I Saw
the “quotes" attributed to me in
Henry and Krys' statement;
Henry and Krys have good
imaginations, and most people
read a polemic as just that: a
polemic. However, when this
“quote" becomes reified through
repeated exposure in the EM}
when this “quote" becomes the
basis tor a (second) personal at-
tack upon me, the matter is less
laughable.

The editorial proceeds, “Pre-
sumably aiter Mr. Nissen’s rev -
lution . . ,the culture and politics
of the majority will be used to
determine what other changes
must be made in me Bill of
Rights Perhaps his society will
be above other freedoms.” It
concludes by noting that my
friends and I are” , . practically
indistinguishable from their
brothers on the extreme right."
The inference clearly is that I
endorse a facist mode of govern-
ment and politics.

Notice that all of these poten-
tially libelous statements rest on
a misquote. This failure to check
the accuracy of your “iacts” is
extreme negligence by almost
any standards oi journalistic
integrity,

The politics of this issue is not
the central point, “Collective vs,
individual rights" is a tough
political question, and I would be
happy to discuss my views on
the subject with anyone. I have
a reeling i am a stronger believer
in individual rights than either
editor of the SEA}. However, it
is largely irrelevant to the most

important point to be made here.
The main issue is that of editorial
and journalistic responsibility.
This semesters’ 5&5, since it
doesn’t bother to check its
“facts,”taresbadlyon this issue.

Perhaps it will require im-
peachment proceedings against
the editors or a libel suit against
the 5&8 and the College to re-
verse this semester's trend
to journalistic irresponsibility.

Bruce Nissan
I'Itlillii's‘ llcpiy:

We would like to answer Mr.
Nissen’s letter by making an
apology to him for the mis-
quotation on which a major
portion of last week’s editorial
was based. We assure him that
(my slight to his character was
unintended, and the mllsuse of
information was totally our fault.
To the Editors:

In your last issue, you placed
Mr. Nasser‘s inflammatory and
illogical piece of propagandistic
advcrtising in the ieatured spot
on your front page, Your position,
as I understand it, is this: to
make the sol; open to opinions
expressed from all points of View.
Such democratic tolerance is, as
a goal, commendable: it seems
legitimate, however, to question
whether one can be undemocratic
in how one presents a given point
of View, e,g., the timing, the spot-
lighting, and so on. i gather that
Mr, Nasser submitted his piece
and that you did not solicitit,

It cannot be that you are in
tlinidated by the awe oi the
faculty. {or you did not print Mr.
Christiansen’s review of the folk
concert 7 a review which it
would have been timely to print
this week but which will be dead
next week. Mr, Nasser's review

The Nature of a Liberal Education: Port 2
The Problem of Definition is Raised

A definition of a liberal
education is our next concern.
Let us examine the essential
points of the goals or definitions
of such an education as given by
five well-known colleges:

Amherst: A broad education,
knowledge of some field in depth,
intellectual competence, and
awareness of problems and
methods.

Carleton: Excellence of in
tellectual training, breadth of"

to require these; and as for the
development of character, in
eluded in the liberal education
by most colleges, very little is
done about it as a requirement.
Again, requirements change
from time to time, most Of them
with respect to detail, but some
of them more drastically.

The difficulties may result
from (a) the fact that the subject
of education is so complex that
t is theoretically and practically

understanding, personal and? nadvisable to frame a single

social responsibility, com- '
mitment to goals which extend
beyond the sell.

Oberlin: Academic excellence,
Search for truth, a sense of social
responsibility, moral integrity,
social justice, service to others.

Williams: Development of
those qualities of the mind and
of character which encourage
creative, independent, and
responsible thought, and a taste
ufintellectual adventure.

Grinnell: Aims (a) to help
shape the character of the
student and make him a better
human being so he can achieve
a personally satisfying and
worthwhile life, (b) to guide him
toward intelligent and respon-
sible citizenship, and (c) to
prepare him for a useful career.

above colleges
profess to have as their aim a
liberal education, but we find
variation in emphasis from one
definition to another; and
although there is something
which is common in the above
definitions, there are differences
also. So since me various
definitions given cannot be
refuted (except on logical
grounds), their diversity may
result from something else,
namely, to the differences in
what is considered to be a good
education for a student.
Moreover, what the definitions
say is one thing, what the colleges
require is another. For example,
nothing is mentioned in the aims
about physical education, very
little about the appreciative or
fine arts, and only two of them
include preparation for a career;
yet all the above colleges seem

definition. or from (b) unclear
thinking; and if (a) is the case.
then the expression “liberal
education" had better be left
ambiguous or undefined. 0n the
other hand, terms should be clear
and have definite meanings;
otherwise communication
becomes difficult, What is more.
it is the professed function of
college educators to enable
students to think clearly and
definitely; and if students cannot
find clarity and definiteness in
the definition of a liberal
education, which is the first
principle and serves as a guide
to their various educational
activities, where else would they
find it?

So there are arguments in
favor of and arguments against
a single definition, Specifically,
the following arguments seem to
show that a single definition is
not advisable.

l. Students go to colleges for
different reasons, some to
become engineers, others
lawyers, other bankers, others
teachers and so on. So why have
a single defin' ion of a liberal
education for all?

2, The material, intellectual.
and spiritual strength and
richness of a nation depend on
individuals With a variety of
goals. The same education would
encourage uniformity and even
mediocrity; and such an
education is the mark of a dictar
torship rather than of a demo
racy.

3. Those affected by a liberal
education are the students, and
it is they (or their parents) who
pay the bill; so it is they who
should decide what to learn. If
their aims and desires differ, so
should their education,

4. The so~called “require
ments" for a liberal education
are determined by a majority
vote in iaculty meetings, and the
changes in those requirements
are result irom changing faculty

groups and changing special
interests and not to any obiective
standards. So the student is vic-
timized by power struggles and
campus politics among the
faculty, and his educational
needs are not determined by an
objective standard. It so, there
should be no requirements, but
freedom of choice.

5 Usually, each professor is a
specialist in one field and has no
integrated knowledge of all the
fields. So even if we assume that
there is such a thing as a single
education which would be the
best thing for all, still no man
exists who knows enough to re-
veal it to us. In the absence of
such a man, then, it would be
better to leave the decision up
to the student.

6, Most of the colleges include
under one of their two principal
aims the development of char-
acter, moral integrity, and social
responsibility, or the like. But
what morality should be, differs
from religion to religion, from
nation to nation, from individual
to individual; and to force upon
students a single morality goes
contrary to their religion or their
conscience. So it appears that it
is not the colleges' business to
teach morality. The student
should be left free to follow the
dictates of his conscience.

7. Man is a changing being, and
as his knowledge changes and in-
creases, so do his goals. To
demand a single definition is to
stop progress and the quest for
higher aims and values.

omer arguments besides the
above may be added, but these
are sufficient for our needs. We
may now turn to the corres-
ponding arguments in favor of
a single definition,

1. A liberal education Should
not be like a chameleon,
changing colors from place to
place, from time to time, from
person to person. It it is some»
thing to be prized, it must stand
for something definite; otherwise
it has no claim to superiority over
any other kind of learning, such
as one gets in a trade school.
Such education is general in
nature, not specific; and its
nature does not conﬂict with the
specific goals; on the contrary,
it adds Something beyond those
goals

2. Variety has its place, but it
is a bad substitute for excellence.
What makes a dictatorship an
evil is not just uniformity, but
had uniformity. A good education
for two students is better than
a good education for one of them
and a had education for the other,
if art has principles and does not

Nasser's piece,

Were Mr, Nasser’s contribution
what it purports to be — a review
oi a movie 7 one could perhaps
see printing it alter the event and
on one oi the inner pages. But
Mr, Nasser 7 adopting the philo-
sophical position so dear to
revolutionaries, that die end
justiiies the means — converted
his review into a diatribe on the
politics and culture of the United
States. In the course of his dias
tribe, he committed many of the
philosophical fallacies which, one
is entitled to presume, his train7
ing has enables him to detect and
which his position obligates him
to eschew,

Now Mr. Nasser has confessed
to me that he is a “socialist.”
After reading his article, I am
inclined to reclabel him a “com-
munist,” but it really does not
matter: one may use the label
“fascist” nr “anarchist" or any
other “-ist'” it is the suffix “sist”
that is important, By making
himself an ”-ist” of any kind, Mr.
Nasser disqualifies himself for
teaching at a liberal arts college.
Lest any reader think me doctri-
naire,1reier him to Mr. Nasser’s
piece in the last 5&8. Such in
ability to write clearly (the paper
would not be acceptable by the
College’s standards as set in the
Humanities course) Would cer-
tainly make me reluctant to
expose my mind to Mr. Nasser’s
sophomoric rhetoric and fresh-
man logic. For $3200 a year, a
Grinnell student is entitled to
something more than that. A let-
ter is not the place to detail the
errors oi Mr. Nasser‘s'harangue:
but I give you my word mat I
am prepared to do so.

Well, an “-ist”, of course.
espouses something that- is cate-
gorized as an “rism” m in Mr.
Nasser’s case, i suppose that he
would have to admit to “social-
ism." The suffix “-ism“ denotes
one oi three things: (1) a practice
or action — e.g., plagiarism or

baptism; (2) a state or condition
— e,g , barbarism or alcoholism;
tat a body of dogma and subs
mission thereunto 7 eg, Com-
munism, Fascism. American-
ism, antirAmericanism,
Angllc wsm, etc. Since one can
elevate air. word to any one oi
three kinds -’ dubious status
merely by adding “ism”, the
notion of a “body of dogmas' need
not imply very much rational
thought. The wildest set of
irrational impulses can be
converted into an ”-ism" by
anyone with even a low talent
[or etymology. Mr, Nasser’s
phrase”Counterrevolutionary
lnterventionism" as a label for
die foreign policy of postwar
America is a fine specimen of
the Idiot ease with which
‘-ism‘s' are generated. The phrase
achieves the paradoxical ends of
being inaccurately censorious
and flattering at the same time:
To concede any post-war ad
ministration of the United States
credit for a policy based on
dogma is to overestimate
grossly the intelligence oi both
Republican and Del ocratic
leaders. Europeans are always
getting into trouble by thinking
(a) that political leaders in the
United States think the same way
they do: (b) that they think at
all. “Intellectualism” is not an
“-ism” which Ameii- is either
adhere to or practice very much

The beauty of Mr. Nasser's
peculiar brand of “-ism” (shall
we call it “Nasserism”7) is that
it exemplifir-s all three dis-
tinctions oi the suffix “-ism”
simultaneously It is a practice,
like plagiarism or baptism, and
Mr. Nasser, like a baptist,
proselytizes with overtly ser»
pentine evangelism. It is also a
state or condition, like barbarism
or alcoholism; and Mr. Nasser,
like the alcoholic, finds himself
under compulsion to see
everything in terms of his
-‘-isrn.” And it is a body of dogma
and submission (hereunto, like
Communism and Fascism; and
Mr. Nasser. like both Coma
munists and Fascists, sees him-
self as riding the crest of “the
wave of the future,” triumphant»
ly capitalizing (it i dare use that
verb of him) on what is really
a spuriously selfsied and self
consuming sense of historical
inevitabllty 7 as ii men could
derive any sense ot virtue irom
being dominated and enslaved by
historical forces.

SCARLET AND BLACK

Well, probably no great harm
has been done, for we may rely
on the native and dense integrity
of the human mind to survive
even the most radical impact and
impulse; and there may even be
some good to be derived from
Mr. Nasser. Field trips are now
a regular part of education, and
hence we take the student to see
a slum, a dope addict, and insane
asylum. Mr. Nasser’s presence
relieves us Irom the need for
making certain kinds of field
trips; he is to us what C. S, Lewis
was to readers a Paradise Lost
— a living exponent oi a body
of dogma so alien that we ought
to feel grateful for having a ”real
live" example at our elbow. As
we ponder the ”ism” which Mr.
Nasser claims to represent and
espouse, we ought to keep him
firmly in mind. Nothing is more
salutary to a teacher man a good
example, even if one “good”
example he oisomething bad.

To The Editors:

With regard to Mr. Nasser's
“The Battle of Algiers"
Anatomy of a Revolution, I find
myself in accord with his enthusi-
asm for the film, but distressed
by his complete acceptance of
Time's paranoid assessment of
the film as a “blueprint for
revolutionists.” “The Battle of
Algiers” is most emphatically
not a blueprint for revolutionists
and most particularly not a blue
print for urban revolutions If
there is a lesson to be learned
from the film it is that revolution
bascd on even a well organized
terrorist activity operating out of
an urban ghetto can and will be
Suppressed by established

like the art of carpentry and
architecture and engineering,
then it must, like any other art,
have definite principles; and if
so, then it must have a unique
goal and therefore a unique defir
nition.

3, By definition, students are
learners, not teachers, and to
allow them to decide on what
their general education should be
is to assume that they already
know what it is; it is like allowing
a sick man to decide on what
medicine to take or whether he
should be operated on or not.
Such education does not prevent
them from choosing specific
goals; in iact, it often helps them
to better survey the various
alternatives,

4. In general, professors are
competent in special fields, but,
having received a liberal educa-
tion. which is general in nature,
they have as a group some know-
ledge oi the advantages of such
education 7 certainly more than
students do. Differences
among them as to what that
education should be exist, but
they agree on most issues. The
lack oi a single definition does
not deny its possible existence;
it merely suggests that we should
make a greater eiiort to come
close to it.

clude the integration oi various

liberal education should have a

6. The tendency in the last few
decades on the part of colleges
to pay less attention to the
development oi character m
students is partly responsible ior
the increase in lack of com»
munication between students and
administration and in campus
disorders, Freedom for one who
knows what the good 15 and
follows it is good; but, for one
who is irresponsible and follows
his emotion, it is evil. There exist
such things as proper habits for
all, e.g., responsibility, generr
osity. and respect for others, and
these should be part of a liberal
education for all students,

7. Man’s nature does not
change; he is still rational
(capable of making general
statements, communicating,
reasoning, etc.) So as long as he
remains a man, his generic
potentialities remain the same.
if he adds to his knowledge, such
change is one of degree, Now a
liberal education is Concerned
with what is best for him
generically. as a man; so such
education should have a single
definition.

The arguments here given {or

in character, Our next concern
is to indicate some preliminary
principles of education and then
proceed to a definition.

Although Art‘s motion was
overwhelmingly crushed, the

encouraged Art to try again real

Wyly’s Collegium Presents Renaissance Music

Herrick Chapel was once again
filled with sounds of Renaissance
music last Friday evening when
Grinnell's Collegium Musicum
presented its ﬁrst concert at the
semester This Renaissance
concert did not attract the crowd
that David Harris, the lutenist,
did, and [or understandable
reasons: the masses do not love
a dilellante and Grinnell music
organizations are full of them.
I am by no means belittling all
those amateur musicians who
keep the Grlnnell music depart
meiit in existence and who put
in one helluva lot of hours for
every concert in which they
perrorm. But i do believe that
there are a number oi things that
could be done to make their
pertormances appear livelier and
more professional,

The guiding principle or the
Collegium Musicum is an admirv
able one. The majority of their
concerts represent experiments
in the reconstruction of 16th or
17th century sonorities. That is
to say, they attempt to use
combinations of instruments and
voices which most closely resems
ble those that were popular when
the music was written. The
opening and closing works on the
program most vividly demon-
strate what I am trying to say.
In ”Laudate Dominum” by Ciao
dict Merulo the instrumentation
included a soprano soloist, a re-
corder quartet, a vocal quartet,
one Violin and viola, two trom-
bones, one lute, and harpsichord
and cello continue. To the twenr
tieth-century concert-goer
this seems like an odd congloms
erate of instruments, and one can
hardly imagine the five Vocalists
being heard at all, Similar in-
strumentation was used in
Giovanni Gabrieli‘s “Magnificat
Anima Mea.” However, in this
polychoral work the vocalists and
recorder quartet remained up
trout and on opposite sides oi the
stage and the strings and winds
were put further back and
directly in lront oi the altar, in
short, the choice and arrange
ment of instruments and voices
is an important part oi recon-
structing 16th century sonorities.

Thisrtypie oi experimentation
does, nonetheless, present some

By Kathryn Heinxe

problems for the amateur
musician. A polychoral piece
leaves small groups or instru»
ments and voices dangerously
isolated from each other,‘ and
every part is transparent. Ina
tonation and ensemble visibly
suffered in both the Merulo and
Gabrieliworks.

The concert also included
several Montcvcrdi madrigals,
These were presented by the six
vocalists ol the Collegium an
companied by Prolcssor James
Wyly on the harpsichord, Al
though thcir intonation problems
were somewhat disturbing, l
consider a spiritless rendition the
grcater transgression. Madrigals
can be iun to sing and just as
much run to listen to, yet except
for a few moments, I felt as
though the Singers were dragging
themselves through the pieces
and not relaxing enough to give
Monteverdi a chance. At the risk
oi being redundant, I must make
similar comments about the
instrumental groups that played
tour canzonl by Frescobaldi.
Pitch. ensemble and style lelt
much to be desired.

Floyd Slotterback's per-
formance of “Five Songs" by
John Dowland was definitely the
highlighter the program. Accoms
panied by Timi Townsend on the
lute. Floyd successiully captured
thc spirit oi each song. His in-
tonation and tone are consistently
good, and he is to be applauded
iorhisstage poise.

Perhaps making comments
about stage presence is going to
make the appear all the more
stuiisshirtcd and bourgeois, but
there is something that really
disturbs me about musicians who
do not know how to react to ap-
plause. Too many Grinnellians
shuttle their lect and look
anywhere but at the audience.
You would think they were ems
barrassed to be there, Grinnell
musictalls! enjoy, enjoy! Per-
torinances would pick up considv
crably it you relaxed a bit more,
looked as though you were having
a good time, and let the audience
know that you had heard them
applauding. Music is a joyiul
thing, and it IS your responsibility
to communicate that to those who
come to listen to you.

Uncle Sam's Club Makes Appeal
For Help From Grinnell Students

Uncle Sam’s Club, a
recreational youth center in
Grinneli, is in desperate need oi
college help. The club has a
program which provides ac-
tivities {or children and youth
irom iour years old through high
school age. College volunteers
are badly needed, usually one
afternoon or evening a week, to
help supervise and stimulate
activities.

William Roecker, Assoc.
Professor of German, who was
recently elected to the club’s 15
member executive board, ex~
pressed concern over the lack oi
interest by college students this
spring, Mr, Roecker said‘ “In
years past we have had as many
as so or so students participate,
But this semester there are only
7 students coming irom the
college.”

The club was founded in 1901
by a group oi Grinnell students

New Church Service

By Nada Maniginletti

In an experiment to reverse the
diminishing size of me college
congregation, Reverend Haas
has turned over Sunday worship
service to the Students.

The first “self-service ser-
vice," last Sunday, replaced the
weekly choral concert with in-
iormal, group folk singing. Oh
fine, I thought, Nothing is more
vapid than a hip, withit, sugar-
coated, Christian service, But
when a heated discussion on the
meaning of communion replaced
the usual, soporific sermon, I
began to have second thoughts.
Some people emphasized the
worship of Christ in communion,
while others stressed the “good
feeling” at union and Comrades
ship among the congregation.
Still others denied any dichotomy
between the two. With the
problem yet unresolved, the ma-
jority of the Congregation sang
their way up to the altar to take
communion. For me, who ordir
narily sits through Sunday wor-
ship with my lower lip stuck out
as tar as possible, this com—
munion was a unique religious
experience

Sports, like all other entertainr
merits, serves, through our atten-
tion, to bring' our cornried minds
back to awareness of the essen-
tially moral nature oi the
universe in which we live. The
upcoming presentation,
Basketball Game Against Coe,
demands our attention as an Obs
v'ious case in point.

It is not possible, even in the
depths of moral complicity (left
and right) in which we wallow
(structurally, to be sure, but
wallow none the less) to ignore
the statement which this
production makes in its very
form, to say nothing (for the
moment) of the drama of its
content.

yet spontaneous amalgam of
rules and players, stratagems
and spontaneities, and social-
ity and atomism. (It is an en»

who did not hesitate to ignore
them.) But who could fail to
notice the Subtle introduction, by
means of this structure of that
great Lutheran, Paul Tillich‘s
ontological tension of “partici-
pation and individualism?" (All
those so failing are to write a
long, indignant, and if possible,
tiresome letter to the editors,

Lutherans and socialists may be
content to throw inkpots.)
Another point must be stressed
concerning the teios oi Gamé‘,
quite apart from its socio-
economic, and hence didactic,
elements. Sports in general are
in their very essence infor-
mational. They create infor-
mation, and, in this very act,

simultanaelly oi teleology with
its concomitant iormal, final.
and efficient reification. The
game evolves new conceptual
horizons of dynamic plasticity in
a three dimensional environ-
ment. It thus serves as a direct
challenge to the transmissmnal
and onerdimensional informa-
tional structure of the American

is achieved Without the aid either
oi metaphor (linearity), or of

commitment need not be

Netmen Charge; Now 5-6

By Roger Rowe

It seemed last Saturday that
Grinnell's basketball team was
going to throw away its game
against St. Olaf in vvhat has come
to he recognized as its usual
pattern. Just the previous night,
against Carleton, the cagers
appeared to be in complete
control, dominating the boards,
playing a tough defense, and
taking good shots. Then every»
thing crumbled. Their momen-
tum ceased and then reversed,
and they wound up three point
losers to a team they could have
run off the court.

On Saturday the relentless
Swedes, Finholt and Bungaard,
brought their team back to knot
the score with only seven seconds

clearly resembling previous
Pioneer collapses But then last

As their 5-6 conference record
indicates and last week‘s games
demonstrate, it has been an up
and down season for the
Pioneers. This reporter believes
that it is going to be “up” tor
the rest oi the schedule, and
wants to pay tribute to a team
that has broken with the too-long-
standing tradition of Grinnell
losing basketball games.

To what do we attribute this
reversal of tradition? Coach
Pfitch’s strategy? New, ”pro
fessional" uniforms? Gatorade
on the bench? None of these is
too likely. The answer is among
the players, and in their newly-
iound aggressiveness and con-
iidence in their ability to play
ball with any team in the confer
ence. When they lose, they lose
fighting.

More speciiically, as goes Boh
Burnett. so go the cagers At the

feet standing slightly in awe oi
all the others. He wanted no part

different player now. Now he
delivers ball to hoop around,

players, He has coniidence that
no one can stop him once he gets

rebounding strongly, and with
excellent control. He is the
team‘s most Obvious example of
this new aggressiveness and
confidence.

lob lurne”

This reporter believes that the
credit for this change belongs to
players like Don Peterson and
Greg Bombinski. Donny is the
“toughest little competitor” both
on this team and in the cons
ierence. His personal flash and
determination have significantly
affected the whole team. The
Bomber is perhaps the worst
loser and most vocal critic both
of his own and of the teams'
efforts since Snowman, Roger
Able. No complacency and few
delusions of ability remain
among the players long with the
Bomber around, No one is
satisiied, and no one quits
fighting. To these two and to their
prodigy, Burnett, belong the
credit for Grinnell's resurgence
to respectability in basketball,

Simpson Team

By John Nigel Pepper

Wrestling before a “crowd” of
sonic iorty souls, Maurice Hunt's
squad dropped a dual meet with
siinpson College here on Wed»
licsday. Hunt is now able to field
ninc wrestlers suited up ior
meets, up irom only four at the
start of the season. And while
this does not necessarily make
a great team, a good deal of imr
proveinent is evident, both in
individual and in team per-
inrmances as evidenced by the
2514 score of this week's meet

Chuck Farr at 116 1b,, although
wrestling cautiously, wore down
his opponent and dominated most
of llls match to win 771, Mike
Brown, a newcomer at 126, put
in a vcry strong perioi-mance and
pinned a Simpson wrestler who
showed rather more style than
skill. Grinnell wrestlers were
pinned in the next two classes
Derek Feilbert doggedly held out
but iinally went down to a con-
stdel'ably more skilled and ex-
perienced Simpson opponent,
