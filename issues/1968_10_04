— Ptero Editor's I-V
Trial a Test Case

A girl, not a student of Grinnell College, was
found in the room of Richard Schneirov by a mem-
ber of the cleaning staff of Loose Hall on Wednes—
day, September 25. Schneirov is the editor of the

pterodactyl, the “underground"
newspaper produced by Grin-
nell students.

Richard Schneirov was not in
his room at the time

The case will come to the new
gidicial court. This will be the
’rst time the issue of illegal
visitations has faced the court.
Schneirov will refuse to stand
trial unless the trial be open,
he indicated in an interview.
l-le does not think the trial will
begin until next week,

“I think l’ll get Conduct pro,"
laid Schneirov. But a verdict
of this sort Will be unacceptable
to him. “Anything less than
‘nbt guilty' will be unaccept.
Ible," he said.

Schneirov war warned on
Thursday, Septt 26, of what
might happen to him if the girl
did not stop living in his dormi-
tory room, Nevertheless, the
girl stayed, When asked why he

ad her stay when he knew it
might endanger him Schneirov
replied, “Because i wanted her
to stay, I like her and wanted
her to stay. I didn’t obey the
administration b e c a u s e it
doesn’t have the right to make
miles concerning the l-V situa-
tion in residence balls”

The case will be turned into
a test case, if Schneirov is suc-
oesstul,

Dean of Students Eugene
Thompson Said that a Situation
in which there is coeducational
use of dormitory rooms is
simply not tolerated in this
.World.

It the case does not go as
Schneirov hopes, he says there
may be mass sleep-ins, or some

Five Frosh Nqbbed
ln Merril Park

Last Friday live 18-year aids
were arrested in Merrill Park
for illegal possession or beer.
Only three of the five were Grim
hell students; two were visitors
from out-of-town.

The five were taken to court
iiaturday and lined $100 each
plus court expenses, which
amounted to 54 in each case,

When Police Chief Bill Peter!
was asked about the recent
number of arrests tor the illegal
drinking by minors, the chief
replied, in effect, that it under
lge drinkers are caught they
will be arrested. The large

Regional Meeting

The Students for a Democrat-

seems to have become an ac-
tive, organized group this year.
With a policy of trying to be
“alert to problems on campus
that are problems in Society,"
as Mary Malcolm, ’69, stated,
the SDS will present different
topics of concern [0 the Grin-
nell student body. Also the
Grinnell SDS plans to partici-
pate in national SDS functions,

This weekend Grinnell hosts
the first SDS regional confer-
ence to which representatives

key speakers will be Mary
Malcolm, who will discuss her
recent trip to Cuba. Joe Berry,
8 inrmer Gminell student, will
attend as a full-time regional
traveler.

According to the Pterodactyl,
“The purpose of the confer-
allele is twofold, organizational,
and educational. The education-
al function will be to acquaint
many sns people or prospec-

SENATE PASSES RESOLUTION
FOR 24 HOUR OPEN LOUNGES

Faculty Accepts
Credit-Foil Grade
In Social Studies

The elimination of the tradi-
tional grading system in the
ﬁrst semester (1968) Social
Studies course, approved Mon-
day by the faculty, is meant to
stimulate students to think let
themselves rather than to raise
the pass-fail issue for all
courses, stated Gregory Gur<
on (History).

The decision is an exception
to the passiail option allowing
upperclassmen to elect one
course, outside of general and
major requirements, per semes-
tar as pass-tail. The interdis-
ciplinary Social Studies stall of
13 was unanimous in its pro-
posal to experiment with the
new course, which is “man-
dated to experiment," said Gun
on The Educational Policy
Committee in the Social Studies
division released the staff’s
proposal to the faculty in the
division about a week ago.
Monday, it was given to the
entire faculty for a final deci-
sion without a recommendation
from the Executive Council, ac-
cording to William Pollak (Eco-
nomics).

The one-semester innovation
will allow for the second se-
mester statt to proceed with
the course as they see fit, Some
or the laculty were hesitant to

The Executive Committee of

EDITOR'S NOTE:

We are printing stories
about the procedures two
other schools in our conier—
ellce took to change the op-
en dorms rules on their cam»
poses, and what their new
dorms programs are.

Gi‘innell Students are not
the only ones dissatisfied
with present rules. it might
be helpful to the inevitable
debate on open dorms to
compare our present living
situation with those of oth-
er schoﬂls.

Then again, perhaps his
tory does not teach, and
perhaps (for which there is
a great amount of evidence)
men do not learn by the ex-
perience at others. it such be
the case, these stories may
be Considered curiosities.

During the week or Sept, 9,
the Student Council of Cornell
College, Mount Vernon, Iowa,
in a closed meeting passed a
resolution giving each dormi-
tory jurisdiction over its open

The plans were not submitted
to the Oliice of Student Affairs,

tion which is concerned with
such issues as open dorms, but
the office was simply notified of
the decisions the student gov<
ernment had made

to give themselves four nights of
open dorms. In general, the

proved a statement supporting

Longcm Changes
Open Dorm Rules

Katherine Karlson, ’69, presh
dent of Langarl Hall, has formu-
lated a policy ior her hall where
by there are no restrictions on
open dorms except “considen
ation at others,”

“We have open dorms that
are based on consideration oi
other people,” said Miss Karl-
son. She explained that she
did not want the decision of all
individual to disturb others in
the hall.

“1 want to getaway from the
secretiveness that has existed
in the dorms,” Miss Karlson
continued. When a boy is going
to enter a git-rs tloor, an ac‘
companying girl will be expected
to shout, “Man on the floor"
to inform others ol his presence.

There are discussions in the
dormitory every week. Miss
Karlson said that “in the dis-
cussion, people can learn to be
intentional and not to yield to
peer pressure,"

There are no restrictions at
all on hours for the dorms.
They could be 24 hours. It is not
necessary to ask permission
from the president {or any open
dorm, according to the new
policy. The only restriction is
that those involved not disturb
others.

in a telephone interview Dean
of Student Affairs Stuart Gucci
said that the students had want-
ed a conirontation. However,
when the Student Council acted
in accordance ‘With established
procedure the following week,
tl-ie'administration was receptive
lo the changes. “We didn’t have
a confrontation, .we didn’t shot:
them out. We asked them toga
through Channels, which they
-did the following w ,” stated
The dean.

in the spring or 1967 students
made a proposal to have open
dorms. At Cornell there had
never been open dorms in the
Grinnell sense [if the term.
Twice during the year there
were “npen houses," during
which time the dorms were open
to members oi the opposite sex.

This 1967'pmpcsal was turned
own by the college’s admin-
istration. An appeal was made
to President Stump oi Cornell,
who was agreeable to the rules
change, and in January, 1968, as
an extension AM the .annual
'lupen houses" program, a new
policy took place. This was a
,policy or alteniating open dorms;
i.e., one Sunday alternoon the
girls‘ dormitories would be open,
the next Sunday atternoon the
boys’ dormitories would be open.

COLLE€E MAKES ROOM FOR NEW ROOMS REP. POWELL T0

Pursuing: the trend tor a
more personal atmosphere tor
students-oi Grinnell, several de~
partments. havv ev established
rooms, other than. iaculty oi-
iices, devoted. exclusively to
their respective departments.
The rooms are used: as study
centers and meeting. places. for
majors.

The caucus. room oi. the Pru-
gtam in Practical Political
Education is the oldest and'per—
helps the must successtul or all
the departmental rooms. it was
established in 1959 in [he Bium
House, and moved to Carnegie
iii the iall oi 1963. It serves as
a library [or books and periodi—
cals on politics. and a deposi-
tory ior recorded speeches at
various organizations.

The classical languages room
was established this tall. includ—
ed in the room is an extensive
library pooled irom the persnal
libraries at William Muthben
and John Crossett, and contain-
ing both basic texts and selected
secunduny works. But. according
ta. Crossett, there is no pur-
pose- to the room unless the stu-
dents utilize rt. He sees hope
tor expansion, or the program
to all departments,. providing
majors with a place to meet.
study, and. converse with stu-
dents ot similar majors,. it the
students prove that these rooms
am. worthwhile.

Beth Noble; chairman of the

tirely up: to the students. Miss

complete library of pertinent
books. and periodicals,. Miss.

The Education department's

available to students Working
toward their certification. RE<
cently moved to ARI-l. the room
contains a library at high school
text books as well as pruiession—
al books dealing with the psy-
chology oi education. Both types
of books are replenished at. the
rate of approximately one hun-
dred and iiity new books a year.

Included in the sociology room
are a. collection of census vol<
time s, sociological research
data. and also books and peri-
odicals. Another room is de-
Votedi specifically to research.
All material and data from the
school's. annual ﬁeld trip are
analyzed here.

The anthropology room is now
being used. as a laboratory tor

ever, is anticipating. a- museum

Editorial . . .

,The Schnoirov Case

When the Schneirov case comes to court, the
jurors will have a difficult chore. If they were to
judge simply on the basis of whether or not a rule
was broken, there would be no question of the ver-
dict. Schneirov himself readily admits to having had
a girl in his room. The only problem would be that
of sentencing.

The court, however, may be tempted to ques-
tion the rule, to determine whether the rule is in ac-
cordance with the law that one should not harm
himself or another unjustly.

Law is the conscience of society. Rules are the
applications of that conscience to particular situa-
tions. The court will thus have to decide whether the
rule is a violation of our collective conscience.

If the court decides to do this, it must define
‘harm’ and ‘justice.’ The term ‘harm‘ may be more
pertinent to the issue.

It may be that neither oneself nor any other
person is harmed by a violation of the open dorms
rule. It may be that once the rule was related to the
universal law, and at that time one would have done
harm by violating the rule. It may be that times
have changed, and, since people no longer think in
the same Victorian fashion, the rule is outdated. it
may be that the rule exists unfounded by any law,
that questions of “harm" and “justice” are irrele-
vant. All this may be.

If the court is unable, or does not have the right,
to disentangle such complexities and implications,
it must act in accordance with the rules that are al-
ready established. To act in any other way would.
lead to anarchy, a situation repugnant to any rea-
soning man.

Ex Post Facto Philosophy

In this week’s edition of the Scarlet and Black
there is a story about the recent change of rules at
Cornell College. An editorial on the victory by
Cornell’s Student Council says: "As many know,
the major issue at stake in last week’s controversy
was not open dorms. The extension of that privilege
was merely the vehicle used to present a much fur-
ther reaching principle — that of student self-de-
termination.”

This is an argument similar to the one about
the American Civil War, that the war had nothing
to do with the question of slavery, but was con-
cerned, rather, with “states’ rights.”

The students take a past action of theirs and
then try to apply some sort of philosophical system
to it, much like Hobbs, who seemed to develop his
ethical theories and then looked for a system of
physics to accompany it,

Presumably, it is expedient to add the philoso-
phical system after the action is complete, for to
have the philosophy in the beginning might restrict
one’s activities,

Let us hope, however, that in seeking a change
of rules, the student government of Grinnell tries
to establish the “much further reaching principle”

before it takes any action, for such a procedure
would be more honest.

Letter To
The Editor

Wallace Ad Criticized

To the Editor:

The s L 3 seems to have
missed the point in printing both
the advertisement for George
Wallace and the advertises
ments for the other two "ma-
jor" candidates. There is a
difference between publishing
a statement, speech, or posi-
tion paper, which seeks to in-
form the public on an issue,
with the theoretical purpose of
aiding it in making an elecion
al decision, and priming an ad<
vertisement, Do politicians ac-
tually seek to make their views
known, or do they try to sell
themselves to the people
through pleasing slogans? The
full-scale advertising cam-
paigns of all the “major" cam
didates seems to make the an-
swer self—evident.

The whole point in advertis-
ing is to make an initial
investment in an ad, which is
then so effective that returns
are more than the initial invest-
ment. Wallace pays some-
one to write resounding state-
ments on why he is just
what the “American people"
need to cure what ails them.
Wallace is packaged and sold
to various organs of public me-
dia, who dish him out to those
who read and buy. Wallace
pays money and gets votes. The
same is true for Humphrey
and the new, improved Nixon.

Wallace and Humphrey and
Nixon don‘t write their own ad-
vertisements; they employ ud-
vertising agencies to help
them, the same as GM, United
States Steel, or the Peace
Corps. But the latter are con
porate groups; the former,

meats, the SH! was not actual-
ly promoting ticedom of speech,
but indulging in complicity or
becoming a partner to wrong
doing, an accomplice to the
crime of pretending advertising

statement, which in fact it does
not.

Last week's editorial states,

If we were [0 run the
ad, Wallace might well
include Grimell in a list

of “liberal" coile g e l

where his ad appeared,

and this might help his
campaign. Or it might
hurt it. Yet if we were to
refuse to run his ad, he
might include Grinnell in

a list. of colleges who re-

fused to run his ad, and

this also might either
aid or hurt his campaign.

It is also uncertain

whether the ad itself will

be of any help to him.

Anything which results in
such ambiguity naturally gives
rise to the question, is it wonh
it? The advertisement actually
has an ideological mmiiica.
lions, has nothing to do with
ircedom or speech; it is an ap-
peai to p consuming public

Where the Truth Lies . . .

By DONALD "UMP

Last week in Gardner lounge,
Mr. Crossett of the Classics de-
partment gave a remn of his
lecture on virginity. Appro-
priately. the talk proceeded
somewhat like a heroic, or
maybe. a mock—heroic battle,
Mr. Crossett took a great deal
of ground using honorable
weapons and great intellectual
deftnesr; but when questions
Were honored from the audl<
ence, his opponents attempted
to retake th: lost turf in what
was at times rather like a
slap-stick pie fight.

in classic form, the defender
of virginity began his confron-
tatinn of arguments in the lec-
ture by reciting a list of illus-
trious ancestors. On his side of
the issue were the GrecoRo.
man heroes like Achilles, Odys.
seus, and Aeneas, and the
founders of the human race,
Adam and Eve. Even though
the fact that Achilles slept with
Briseis was not discussed to
my satisfaction, Mr. Cmssett
had good credentials. In fact,
all of Western civilization
seemed to be in his background,
and it was a generous gesture
that he did not demand the
genealogy of his opponents,

The two major weapons of
the opposition faced by Mr.
Crosseit were the arguments
that sexual intercourse is natu-
ral and that “the Pill" pres
vents all the unpleasant conse-
quences of fornication. The po-
nitlon attacked in the lecture
can be stated as follows: People
of mature age should be allow-
ed to fornicate freely as long
as 1) both are willing, 2) they
are sincere, and 3) no harm
results to either person. After
committing their act, they
should feel no guilt.

Now it seems to me that Ml“,
Crossett’: attack lacked the
flare he showcd two years ago
when the lecture was first giv-
en. But the logic was well
aimed and rharp. Particularly
penetrating were two points:
first, the question, Would you
like the happiness of your life

and the possible creation of new
human life to rest upon prob-
ability? Even if the chancel
lhdt “the Pill" will fall or.
very slight, can you afford to
take any chance at all? Second.
the fact that man only become:
man when he has some rule it!
obey, some choice between
good and bad, like that pm
sented by God's commandment
in Genesis.

it is a shame that the ques«
tions from the audience after
the lecture never rose to the
level of these lovely strokes, so
that someone could at least
have gone down heroically. In.
stead, most of the attacks of
the students were foolish, and
revealed the fact that few men
know how to listen. There were
five misinterpretations of Mr.
Crossett’s analogy between vir-
gins and cars during the first
hour alone, and none of them
as charming as the indignation
of the girl who two years ago
jumped up and cried, “I do not
feel like a used carl” This
year students merely charged
like bulls, and were slaughter-
ed like cattle,

it is interesting that those
who spoke were not strong and
confident; and it is a tribune to
the power of Mr. Crossett’s an
guments that people seemed to
laugh a bit too loudly when
wmeone mocked the analogy of
the used car. Whether or not
anyone was convinced is doubt-
ful, but almost everyone who
spoke up seemed to feel ihrcao-
cncd by the logic. In ia‘c: one
of the most popular position:
was that logic does not lead to
truth, even if tnie statements
are made at each point in the
argument.

I can imagine the words of
two typical members of the
audience as they walked homoi
“Man. you have to answer all
the little questions his way; but
then he puts it together all
wrong." "Right, Herbie. tho
points he made wen ork» but
he was being tricky with the
logic." In other words, comet
where in between the mith lies.

’ h rash of injuries to students
ls well as faculty on the Grin-
nell campus has left people with
casts, crutches and taped ap<
pendages.

Mr, Crossett, after giving his
lecture on virginity last week,

was attacked by a group of anti-
.virginity people on his way
home. In defending himself
against these people ("I’m not
lure if they were boys or girls,"
he said), Mr. Crossett sprained
his thumb, Although no bones
were broken, his thumb was
taped by the doctor to prevent
lurther injury. (The sea thanks
Mr. Crossett for his account. In
keeping with his wishes, the fol-
lowing line from the poem “The
Exaggerator" by Mark Van
Doren is presented — “The
truth to him was like a fan." Mr.
Crossett told the 5&3 that he
has always felt that Van Doren
wrote the poem about him.)

How To Apply To Graduate School

By DALE B. TERRY
Director of Admissiom

Application to graduate
Ichool is essentially no differ
but from the procedure involved
in making college application.
The student must first deter-
mine, in conference with his
major adviser or others in
whom he has confidence, which
lchools are best suited to his
needs, A collection of graduate
school catalogs is available in
the Financial Aid and Place-
ment Office located at the south
end of Burling Library base-
merit.

Once the student has selected
schools best suited to his needs,
it remains to determine appli-
cation and scholarship dead-
lines. Write to the appropriate
officer at the school concerned
and request the necessary
forms. Graduate school dead-
lines for both admission and
scholarship purposes vary wide-
ly and students should have
their selection made and the
rorms in hand by December lst
to assure that they will not
miss specific deadlines.

The tests required for err-
trance to various graduate
lchools will be noted in the ap-
propriate catalogs. .Tliii may

involve the Graduate Record
Examination and/or Advanced
Test in the major field, and
At some schools the Miller An-
alogies Test will be required.
The dates for the GRE upti-
tude and advanced test are
listed below, and students who
need to take the Miller Anal-
ogies Test should Contacter'r
Obermiller to make specific
arrangements, since that test
is usually administered on an
individual basis.

GRE dates:

October 28, 1968
December 14, 1968
January 18, 1969
:Fehniary 22, 1969
April 26, 1959
July 12, 1969

Application forms for the test
are available in the registrar's
office. Those wishing to take
the GRE on October 16, 1968
must have these aplication
forms sent in by October 8.

For information concerning
special tests such as the Law
School Admissions Test, the
Medical School Aptitude Test,
etc, contact the appropriate
pro—professional adviser.

Some words of advice:

1. Do not Wait until the last
minute to ask professors for
recommendations to graduate
school. The early part of our

second semester, which is I
busy time for our professors,
may coincide with the deadline!
for completion of application
forms.

2, Check examination require
ments and make appropriate
arrangements for the necessary
examinations before the dead-
line.

3. Give the Registrar's Office
adequate notice and clear direc-
tions concerning where you
want your transcript sent. If
you will need a supplementary
transcript, please notify the
Registrar's Office before you
leave school in the spring.

4, If a financial statement I:
required by the graduate
school before a fellowship can
be awarded, submit it at least
eight weeks before the school
deadline.

5. Many graduate schools re-
quire a separate fellowship,
NDEA, or assistantship applica-
tion. In some cases you may
need to write directly to the
Chairman of the graduate
school department regarding
assistantships.

6. Don't minimize the impor-
tame of a well written applica-
tion beginning with the very
first letter you write to the
graduate school.

7. Check with the appropriate

i Marmst Subversmn—A ReView I

By "twins KISSANE
Deplriment of English

"A Night of the Opera"
—-starring the Marx Brothers (1935);

When Arieti asked me to re-
view this Marx Brothers clas«
sic, horse sense told me to beg
off. You will understand why
when I admit that I still find
it more natural to speak of
"movies" than of "films."
That's about as out of it a!
you can be. But, as you see.
curiosity as to why the Marx
Brothers should rate so high
with the knowing young pre-
vailed.

The most obvious and prob-
nbly the most crucial thing
about the Marx Brothers’ hu-
rnor is that it is utterly and
gloriously low-brow. Now the
essence of good “low-brow"
comedy is not simply the ab-
sence of sophistication but the
fun it takes at the expense of
high-brow pretensions. That is
the point of nearly all of the
Marx Brothers' gags and un-
tics. In this respect, as in all
else, Groucho is the key man.
I recall a scene, from another
movie, that epitomizes his ge-
nius for shocking human gran-
deur into dumb passivity. He is
working as a hotel desk clerk
and some pompous ass atoms
up to him saying, “You people
can't treat me like this! i am
owner of the largest chain of
laundries in the world!” “Laun-
dries, eh?" says Groucho, nev-
er daunted as he rips off his
shirt and thrusts it at the luv
dignant swell. “Then take this
and have it back by Wednes-
dayl"

"A Night at the Opera" in
really a series of variations on
this theme. It takes us on n
tour of all the customary
haunts of Privilege, but alwayl
with u iow»brow twist: the ritzy
dining room (a scene for
Groucho's unabashed wise-
cracks): the ocean liner (with
the colorful revelry of steerage
immigrants in contrast to the
sedate luxury of first class);
and, above all, that bastion of
“cult-yah," the opera house.
The opera is a perfect scene for
me Marx Brothers’ low»brow
sabotage, and they make the
most of it. Groucho is insuffer<
ably gauche and irresistibly
funny leaning out of his box to
offer a dime to the stony-faced
swell who returns his program
to him. Chico and Hal-pa al-
most literally tum Ii Trovatoro
— that lugubrious tragedy —
Into a three-ring circus. It's
all summed up when — owing

to a substitution of scores -—
the opening measures of the
overture are suddenly trans-
formed into a raucous render.
ing of “Take Me Out to the
Ballgame."

That the Marx's low-brow
comedy should strike a sympa-
thetic chord in numbers of the
current student generation is
easy to account for — on one
level at least: it appeals to
their particular sentimentality
and disillusionment. Chico and
Harpo, those sweet - natured
clowns who make children
laugh and weep with piano and
harp, are the perpetual iugi.
tives from the hirelings of the
high-brow establishment: stew-
ards, doorman, waiters, guards,
and — of course — the cops.
If today's radical finds his sen-
timents confirmed in these two,
he must surely revel in
Groucho's brazen insouciance
as he discomfits the respeo<
table. No innocent fugitive, but
u nervy lnterloper named Otis
P. Driftwood, he is out to beat
the swells at their own game.
But he does it with a style
no enemy of the affluent estabv
lishment can fail to appreciate.
His shoe polish mustache is an
flagrant an outrage to prim
propriety us the raunchiest set
of sideburns, his obscene cigar
is as hold an affront to solemn
decency as the weediest reefer.
Anyone aspiring to epater lo
bourgeois has got to admit
Groucho was there first, From
that initial moment when we
see him ogling the decolletago
of a wealthy patroness from hll
semi—crouch we recognize in
him the apotheosis of the urn-
couth.

There are worse ways of has
ing entertained than by comedy
of this sort, Yet it is anothel
of many recent youthful enthu-
slasms that prompt me to hope
we do not iorget that a high-
brow cultivltion of a low-brow
taste can never quite be the
thing itself. To identify with
something isn‘t the same in
becoming identical to it — any,
more than playing in her dairy
could make Marie Antoinette a
real milkmaid. In short, it
won't do to confuse a style with
a condition. So much for moral-
izlng; corny and predictable an
it is, “A Night at the Opera“
could hardly be called a great
film. but itducs makes. good
night at the movies.

3 Student Government Speaks

By TOM THOMAS

Following petitioning, floor by
ﬂoor discussion and impromptu
meetings, the Senate adopted a
resolution proposing hall de-

' termination of coed lounge use,
In accordance with college leg<
islatlvepmcedures, this pro-
posal will be presented to the
student affairs committee on
Tuesday.

The obvioim questions concern-
lng this matter are what is the
chance of this idea passing and
'Whyvis it different from other
SGA proposals that have failed
in the past. Student desires for
open lounges are nothing new
or particularly exciting to ad-
ministrators or professors. How-
ever, I believe this issue does
bring in something new. That
is, student government is not
just proposing what is wanted,
but also an idea for how to go
about accomplishing it.

In the past, students have
been continually criticized, and
i think rightly so. for present
ing only pleas for change or in-
novation with occasional accom-
panying philosophies. Specific
problems and mechanical ques-
tions have been largely ignored.
Acceptance of student proposals
has often been refused on the
grounds that they were not suf-
ﬁciently ”thought through."

son's open lounge proposal
does have the means of imple-
mentation included. Provision:
are made loi- dealing with
“‘cnrnpits security" and hail

determination. Enforcement
provisions are clearly spelled
out. Philosophical matters
have long been belobured—thls
proposal is directed to meet
faculty and administrative
questions.

In preliminary discussion with
deans and at this week's student
affairs meeting, prospects for
acceptance of the SGA proposal
look hopeful. in any event, reso<
lution of the question should
come quickly: in the event of
passage the matter goes to the
president.

Aside irom the matter of or»
en lounges, the student affairs
Committee, on a broader scale,
is considering the entire ques
tion of student rule structure.
It is the growing consensus that
the present system of regula.
tions, policies and inferences
concerning student life is inade-
quate. Arising from a consider-
ation of the college drug state-
ment, the committee is consider-
ing the formulation of a compre-
hensive statement of college
policy on the “rights and free-
doms" of students. All existing
college regulations and state—
ments could then be reviewed
in the context of these “first
principles." The committee is
approaching this matter in an
open way, and anyone with ideas
on the subject should contact
SGA.

BRIDGE: POST MORTEM

By JOHN GORDLEY
An example of rather unor-
thodox bidding occurred in the
Forum this week, in which the
contract of 3 NT. was reached
on the strength oi an opening
bid and a long suit. The dealer
opened one diamond with the
following hand:
S A x x
H A x x x
D A Q x x
C X X
His partner jumped to 3 NT.
holding nothing but an incred-
lble length in diamonds:
S x X K
H x x
D K J in x x x x
C x
Declarer's logic behind such
a questionable bid lay in the
hope of enticing a diamond lead
from an opponent who would
interpret the nu trump bid as
showing weakness in diamonds
and, having a singleton or
doubleton, would lead to his
partner's marked strength.
Fortunately for deciarer, this
error actually took place. The
contract, however, would still
have been down if the dummy
'had not had all three aces, for,
after running diamonds, de-
ciarer would be forced to let in
the opposition, who by this time,
,bopeiully, would have discov-
ered the ruse and would attack
the unguarded club suit, wiu-
niilg 5 tricks with a five - five
split, As the cards lay. the
only lead that could deieat the
contract was a club which, ig-
noring the erratic bidding, was
the correct lead against a no
,trump contract, Declarer would

have been down one before he
got in. Furthermore, the open-
er’s hid did not necessarily
promise the ace of diamonds.
the absence of which would
mean almost certain disaster
no matter what. lead was made.

This analysis is not a dia<
tribe against‘all unusual Corr
tracts, but rather a criticism
of an incredibly optimistic bid
which required 3 aces in the
dummy and a misguided lead
by the opposition. The possibil<
ity of a diamond void in the
wrong hand or a king instead
of an ace in dummy would be
enough for most enthusiasts to
be privately astonished at part
net's opening and then, after
entertaining brief thoughts or
game, put the contract at the
proper level of two diamonds.

Campus Events:
Computer Dance,
Powell Lecture

By ALLAN HART

In a continuing effort to
make college activities more
relevant to the outside world
of diversified opinions and in<
terests, the events of coming
week cover the whole range,
from a sampling of the all-
encompassing centralizat i o n
to come (the Computer
Dance), to the dissident voices
of its early victims (Adam
Clayton Powell). Of course you
(encersitlers have been consid-
ered tot), with football films
and a singing group that per
forms everything from Men~
delssohn to Seeger.

Friday, October 4, starts out
the entertainment with a fac<
uliy recital in Herrick Chapel
at 8 pm. James Wyly will play
the harpsichord and Wilma
Zonn the oboe. Then in the South
Lounge of the Forum at 9:30
there will be a folk music con<
cert, featuring Atanas Kolar-
ovski, Also at 9:30. “Rebec-
ca". a Hitchcock film. will be
shown in ARH.

On Saturday the 5th, the
highly regarded Gregg Smith
Singers will perform in Rob-
erts Theatre at 8 pm. The
group sings all kinds of music,
as noted above, and has tray.
eled across the US. and Eur-
ope. At 9:30 the big event of
the week will be held—the
Computer Dance, in the North
Lounge of the Forum. Selec-
tions or dates for participating
students were made by a com-
puter after the students filled
out a very general question-
naire. Music for the dancing,
mechanized party-ites will be
provided by the IBTC, a popu-
lar Iowa band. Finally, at
11:00 in ARI-l [he movre “MD-
rocco” will be shown.

On Sunday, there will be a
film seminar on “Reilecca” in
the Burllng viewing room at
2:30, The film will be shown
at 9 pm. in ARH.

On Wednesday October 9, at
8:00, the Honorable Adam
Clayton Powell of the House of
Representatives will speak in
Herrick Chapel, ilis topic will
be “Race, Poverty, Politics,
”68.” He is an extremely con<
troversial spokesman for the
Black people of America, and
this may be your only chance
to hear what he really thinks,
rather than what the nation's
press thinks of him. Following
his appearance, a little heavy
drama will be provided by a
movie of last weekend's foot-
ball game against Cornell, to
be shown in the South Lounge
of the Forum at in pm. At
10:30, in the North Lounge,
there will be a jam session
with a live build, as of this
date unidentified, although ru-
mors that Moby Grape will ap-
pear have been denied.

Alter all this steaming cona
trovcrsy is over, your mind
can relax on Thursday at a
Bridge lesson in the Forum at
7:30.

Ex Loco Players Reorganize

Two plays, radio plays, and

improvisations are being planned

by a group of students called
the EX Loco Players, The Ex
Loco Players is an oil-campus
theater group not officially con
nected with the college. They
took the name from the student-
run colfee house which closed
at the end of last year. They
have retained the name but are
now looking for a new place for
their performances. The first
play this semester, now being
chosen, will be contemporary
but conventional in nature. The
second will probably be from
the theater of the absurd.

The Ex Loco Players began
last spring when a group of
eight students decided that they
wanted to produce The Birth
day Party by Harold Pinter.
They approached Ned Donahue

(Speech and Theater) with their
idea and asked him to direct
the play. The result was the
performances given at Ex Loco
last spring.

The Ex loco Players operates
much like a theater company.
The members work as a group
win: no one leader. Together
they decide upon the play to be
performed, the director, the
cast, and the set. Donahue serves
as an adviser, not as a leader or
teacher. The emphasis or the
group is on putting on a pru<
duciion rather than learning
about the theater. '.

The Ex Loco Players now has
twenty-five members and wet-
comes anyone interested in help-
ing to produce a play. Persons
to contact are Debbie Abbott,
president, and Bonnie Tinker,
secretary.

Aware Works To Educate
White Community on Blacks

Working with church groups
is one way that AWARE (Asso—
ciation of Whites for the Ad-
vancement of Racial Equality),
is attempting to improve race
relations and understanding
within the Grimell community.

Four members of AWARE

the semester is now almost

grading will again be made in
January.

concern over precedent— set<
ting was met by the contention
of the Social Studies Staff that
the grading system itself should
not and will not make a major
difference in the Social Studies
course or any other course:
The quality or the students, the
material, and the professors
are still the crucial factors in
course evaluation, Said Poliak.

The principle of grading will
not be eliminated, but evalua-
tion on a two-point instead or
a seven-point scale will "force
the stair to evaluate each stu-
deut iuthvrdually, not just on
[he terms oi individual grades,”
Giti’off stated. Part of the issue
is to see if students work just
for grades, or if initiative “can
be drawn out of them." ex-
plained Neal Mllner (Political
Scrence). Student expression of
interests and needs is also
crucial to the success of the
experiment.

Karen Frank, cry-chairmen of
AWARE, Phil De Jong. Church
Committee chairman, and Mary
Stuart led the discussion.

AWARE also serves as is sup—
port group for the Concerned
Black Students. As co-chairmen
Karen Frank and Nancy Rocks
Well explain AWARE’S func‘
tions and relationship to CBS,
“CBS feels it is not the black
man‘s role to educate the
white. It is the white man's
role to educate himself."

The Education Committee of
AWARE, headed by Andy
Loewi, is suggesting and on
ganizing educational programs
for Grinneil’s elementary, jun‘
ior high and high schools. Black
History seminar, taught by
Murray Nelson, will begin 0c-
tober 29. The course is open to
all high school students, but
they won't receive any credit
for the course because it is in-
dependent of the regular School
system.

The Education Committee
also hopes to bring the first
film in the CBS (television)
summer Series. Of Black Amer.
ica, narrated by Bill Cosby, as
a high school assembly. Book
lists and courses emphasizing
black history are being encour-
aged. AWARE hopes to orgam
iZe educational Skits {or ele«
mentary students and projects
With Uncle Sam's Club and
scout groups as part or ”the
white man’s role to educate
himself" about the black man,

A monthly ne'sletter about
AWARE’S actiV ies will be
published for all Grinnell Col-
lege students. Any questions

Win Line 24-31

After two successive defeats
'to Midwest Conference teams,
the Grinnell pacers fairly eas~
ily defeated Cornell on Satur-
day, September 28, at Grinnell.
The meet was held during the
first half of the varsity foob-
ball game, with Grinnell win-
ning with 24 points, while Cor-
nell had 31.

The contest was held over a
four mile course, with weather
Conditions of 60 degrees, a very
light wind tram the southeast,
and overcast skies. The course
was laid out around the inside
perimeter of the Ward Field
and out on the college golf
course.

Clive Clark of Cornell took
individual meet honors by cap-
turing first place in a time of
22 minutes, 31.6 seconds. Cor-
nell also placed third, in the
person of Dick Gast. Besides
second place, the Pioneers took
all the other top seven places.

Eric John placed second
overall as the Pioneers’ high-
est scorer. Eric dropped hi1
times to 23 minutes, 9 sec-
onds. Bob Asbille was fourth,
in a tine time of 23 minutes.
22 seconds. Although Bob had
been plagued by insomnia for
the past few days, he still per-
formed well. Following Bob
were Tim Power and John
Russell, who tied tor iinh place
in a time of 23 minutes, 39 sec
ﬁnds. The all - important filth
scorer for Grinnell was John
Siekert, who ﬁnished the four
miles in 24 minutes, 21 sec.

HARD KNOX SIWASH OUT SOCCER
TEAM 2-]; CORNELL REMATCH UP

Two quick goals in the open‘
lng minutes were too much for
the Pioneers to overcome as
the Knox Siwash handed them
a 2-1 defeat. The 1055 brought
the Pioneers' record to 1-1.

Grinnell’s defense was slow
in jelling in last Saturday’s bout
with Knox. Before they could
get going the Pioneers trailed
24). For nearly 70 minutes neith.
er team scored. Finally in the
closing seconds of the game
Steve Korstad, the Pioneer right
wing, ricocheted the ball into
the goal off of a fine corner
kick by Dave North The Pie-
neers had made numerous siege:
on the Siwash goal but were only
successful on the one try.

Once the defense took hold.
Coach Hemingway’s crew played
a steady game. They threatened
several times and controlled the
ball adequately.

Goalie Dave Coron and leit
halfback Mike Eaton played a
commendable game on delense.
Bruce Graham and Dave North
led the offensive attack.

Tomorrow the Pioneers travel
to Mount Vernon to race Cornell.
The rematch should be very eic
citing. While the Pioneers seem-
ingly won going away in the
first meet, Coach Hemingway
feels that the game was much
closer than the score revealed.
Both teams will be up for this
one.

Sunday, the Pioneers will re-
turn home to face the Universi-
ty of Iowa on Soccer Field The
Hawkeya team is described
as “having very fine potential."
While the team consists largely
of graduate students and some
semiapfotessionals, Coach Hern-
fngway expects them to send
primarily their college team.
If this is so, the Pioneers stand
a better than even chance to
win. Should the Hawkeyes come
in full strength, the odds would
be substantially stacked the
other way. But in either case,
the two'teams promise to pre.
sent a 'well-executed’ soccer
game. The beginning insect: is
at 2 pm.

Pioneers Lose

43-22; Ripon Up

By REGGIE GRAHAM

Last Saturday, in their first
home game, the Pioneers were
beaten by Cornell 43-22. Both
sides made many mistakes, but
Cornell was able to take advan-
tage of the Grinnell errors.
Each of our first three fumbles
set up uninterrupted drives for
touchdowns. Once we had them
on their own 29 with first and
ﬁfteen. and once we had to
give up the ball on their 33.
Both times they went in for
scores.

We failed however to use the
numerous breaks we had. Rick
Vranek intercepted a pass on
their 26, later recovered a
tumble on their 33, and inter-
cepted still another pass on
their 20 (good day for Rick);
however, each time the PiD‘
neers failed to do anything in
the succeeding downs. Three
times the defense had them
with third down and over
eleven yards for the first, when
the next play set up a touch-
down.

Cornell’s Lannom (HE from
the town of Grinnell) and Cam-
panelli (E) were the main
headaches that day. Lannom
carried the ball twenty»two
times without losing a yard,
and gaining a total of 133.
Campanelli cought eight pass-
es for a total of one hundred
and fifty one yards (ho has
scored a total of thirty points
this year —- good enough to tie
(or second highest scorer in
the conference).

Despite the score and all of
Cornell’s glory, Grinnell did
have some good moments. Punt

and kickoff returns were much'
better; Lewis booted a beautiful
titty-rive yard kickoff and Vra-
nek averaged fortyaone yards
per punt, with one sailing titty.
iour yards. John Winterson
looked great in the second half
after being subjected to a brus
tal double-teamed first half.
Roy Lewis looked good when
he could find running room,
and Gary Johnson did a “fair“
(Coach Bowers‘ term) jolt
when he was in at quarterback.
Steve Hutchings did a iantastio
job blocking a punt, and Bob
Lillis made an excellent pick-up
and forty-yard touchdown run
—— one of the real high points
of the game. Also, I have to
admire the spirit of a team
that can come back after the
half, down thirty-one to eight,
and display the spirit and dos
termination we did in the sec-
ond half. We never gave up,
and the team even had the fans
cheering when the score was so
had.

Tomorrow, Grinnell faces
Ripon (2.0). and it should be
a tough game. It: will be an
away game, and, barring the
mistakes that killed us last
week, we have the potential to
give them a hard time.
