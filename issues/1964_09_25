Terry Releases Fellowship Details:
Applications Should be Made Now

Gx'innell seniors should begin
now to plan their applications
for graduate fellowships, aci-
cording to Dale B. Terry, Reg-
istrar. He emphasized the im-

portance of early planning to
provide for testing and faculty
action, where necessary. Also,
the application deadlines vary
greatly, and some grants re-
quire applications or tests by
mid ~ November. Inlormation
about these grants can be ob-
tained from Terry or Leforne
Sequeira, Director of Student
Aid.

Among the grants available
to Grinnell graduates is the
Lydia Roberts Fellowship to
Columbia University. This
grant of $3,350 for the academic
year, is awarded to graduates
of Iowa colleges or universities
who were born in Iowa.

Another attractive grant is
the Danforth Fellowship, de-
signed to give "personal en-
couragement and financial sup-
port” to graduates preparing
for college teaching positions.
They are available to persons
of any race, creed, or citizen-
ship.

Danforth fellows receive 81800
if single or $2200 if married. Ad-
ditional allowances may be tor
children or additional educa-
tional expenses. The grants are
for one year, but may be re-

 

newed for a total of four years
of graduate study.

Other fellowships may be
held concurrently, with the
Danforth stipend being held un-
til the other award elapses.
Danforth fellowship candidates
are required to take the gradu-
ate record examinations mak-
ing registration before Novem-
ber 8 imperative.

The best»knuwn fellowship for
foreign study is the Fulbright—
Hays Fellowship P ro g r em
Candidates are nominated by
the college. Terry urged that
interested seniors contact him
by the end of the first week in
October. in order to provide
time for the necessary details
of application.

Awards are given for study,
research on teaching assistant
ships to U.S. citizens with a
bachelor’s degree, language
proficiency deemed sufficient
by the Grinnell language de-
partment involved, and good
health.

Grants may be from the 0.5
government only, from the Us.
and the host country. or from
the us. for travel only. A new
program for me 1965-66 year
will provide as many as 80 ad-
ditional grants for study in Lat-
in America. Recommended
areas are social science, politi
cal science, history, law. and

 

humanities.

Brogan looks at British Politics,
Predicts Close General Election

ay sun Taylor

The results of the British
General Election will be close.
Sir Dennis Brogan, visiting pro-
fessor of American Studies,
predicted in the first of a series
of lectures Tuesday night. Bro-
gan, who is a prolific writer
and holder of multiple degrees,
also emphasized that he makes
no claim to be a political
prophet and will not predict
which of the two m'ajor parties
in Great Britain will be suc-
cessful in its bid for control of
the government.

Eight months ago. he said.
the polls showed the liberals
with about a seventy per cent
majority. Now the parties are
running about fifty-fifty.

Brogan explained that no
matter which party wins the
election. there will probably be
a recasting of British politics,

 

Beset By Injuries, Pioneers Open Season Against Ripon;
loss of Lettermen Opens Five Key Positions on Squad

After last Saturday’s intra—
squad game Grinnell’s football
team opens the season for real
against Ripon on Ward Field
tomorrow.

Facing the problem of filling
five key positions coach Edd
Bowers has built a team with
size, depffh and experience. The
Pioneers will probably field an
all ietterman offensive team
and a defensive unit with only

one or two non-lettermen,

Missing from last year’s
squad are all conference guards
Steve Warrick and Pete Hein-
zelman, fullback Joel Goldman,
quarterback Dick Orchard and
end .Tl’m McKlveen. All were
offensive starters,

Bowers has moved J eff
Lewis from the defensive line
to team wich Larry Miller, who
saw offensive action last year

when Heinzelman was injured,
to fill in at guard. Marty Rin-
go, hampered last year by in-
juries, is slated to replace
Goldman while Denny Hanssen
and Barry Anderson are ex—
pected to provide a double
threat at quarterback.

split in that party. The left
wing of the liberal party may
become more socialist, he
said, and the rest may become
something like the American
Democratic Party.

On the other hand, Brogan
suggested that if the Conserva~
tive Party were to lose the gen-

 

eral election, they would prob'<
ably survive the defeat better.
but there would be a fight f0!
power among the leaders of the

party.

Explaining some of the mac
chanics and issues of the eieo-
tion, he emphasized that tho
British people see experience
in Government as important be-
cause when one party is in
power, it does not, as Ameri-
can parties sometimes do, see
lect cabinet members from the
other. Thus a limited group ol
people in the party in power
actually have any experience
particular in i n t e r nation
events.

Brogan said that British poll-
tics are becoming more presi-
dential, He explained that till
personality of the candidate
matters little, but that his im-
age is very important Tho
party name wins the votes, be-
cause the man running is only
the leader of his party

He also commented that there
has' been a somewhat revived
interest in local contests devel-
oping in recent elections.

are both in contention for the
vacated end position. The only
ther expected change on of-
ense will be Tom Lannom, a
linebacker last year, replacing
Morgan Michel at center.

' Bowers saw some offensive
bright spots but was not pleased
with the Pioneer defense in Sat-
urday’s scrimmage. The white
team composed mainly of first-
otrlng offensive players de-
feated the red squad 2142 in
the three quarter game.

Besides the defense a major
boncem for the Pioneers in to
inorrow’s opener will be a rash

f injuries. Reserve fullback
ave Imes, defensive tackle
ete Staben a nd offensive
ckles Eric Miller and Rein
srsl all have shoulder in-
uries.

Ringo has sustained a broken

and reserve tackle Rick An-
Eereon has an injured arm. All
are expected to have recovered
sufficiently to play against
Ripon.

Slated to start in the back

eld are Hanssen at quarter-

ck, Ringo at fullback and
‘dhn Shierholz and Elston
_ owers at halfback. Barry An-
derson is expected to see action
at quarterback.

In the line it will be Lannom
at center, Lewis and L. Miller
at guard, Saral and E. Miller
at tackle and Dave Gauger and
Dewitt at the ends. Al Peterson
moved into contentioin for the
and spot after his pass-catching
performance in the intrasquad
game.

Defensively the Pioneers are
not so well set. Bowers plans
to use less platooning this year
in order to take advantage of
the defensive experience of
many of his offensive players.

In the defensive backfield
are expected to be Shierholz,
Hanssen, Bob Watt and Dave
Synhorst. Lewis, Lannom and
Paul Thurston will fill the line-
backer spots. The defensive line
has not been set,

Bowers p l a n 5 no basic
'ohanges from last year’s basic-
ally wing and wing-t offenses.
Defensively the Pioneers should
look very much like last year,
also, using a 5-2-4 or a 5-4-2.

Ripon has had only one im-
portant loss from last year’s
.eam which defeated Gﬂnnell

7-0.

ICARLET AND BLACK

Scarlet Fever

By Dick Lovell
Could Grinnell football teams compete on a respect-
able basis with such schools as Luther, Iowa Wesleyan,
or Wartburg? Such a question invites all sorts of com-

parisons — comparisons of school size, recruiting poli- a

cies, money available and, of course, seasons' records.
The first three categories lay themselves open to a rela-
tively objective evaluation; however, the fourth basis
(and most important) must be forgotten. Not only does
Grinnell not play any of these Iowa Conference schools;
we don't play anyone who does. In fact, there is no
room on our schedule for anything but conference foes
The conference policy of fratricidal scheduling elimi-
Eates any valid evaluation of Midwest Conference foot—
all.

This, however, clears the way for something which
has long been a dream in the minds of many Big Ten
fans — a full round robin schedule with each team
playing each other team once. Well, despite my disap-
pointment at not being able to compare our football
with other small colleges, I must congratulate the con-
ference policy-makers on achieving a really fair meth-
od for naming a conference champion. But wait . . .
it says in the conference rules that only eight games
can be played in any season by any one team. With ten
teams in the conference this means that we have 8/9 of
a perfect round robin. Not only are we the only confer-
ence I know of with no inter-league games, but we are
saddled with an unusually short season.

There are many reasons for this condition: finan-
cial considerations, weather factors and perhaps most
influential, a sense of proportion on the part of the

faculties of the members whose laudable aim is main-
taining competitive athletics as a necessary but limited
phase of member schools’ educational program. No one
who has sat through a Grinnell College game with its
morgue-like atmosphere could have too many serious
worries about football occupying a disproportionately
large place in Grinnell students’ life. We have 89% of
n “ideal situation" Gee, it sure would be nice if . . .

Incidentally, have you noticed the Midwest Confer-
ence prediction in the September 21 issue of Sports 11-
lustrated? (That’s the magazine that picked the Dallas
Cowboys as NFL champions last year, you know.) It
looks like they’re still in the groove with C09, Carle-
ton, St. Olaf, and Cornell as the “contenders” in the
Midwest conference. Notice any omissions?

Thincluds Meet First Test Against SCI,

Hold Championship

The Pioneer cross country
team meets its first real test of
the season this Saturday at 1:25
when the State College of Iowa
visits for a three mile run. The
race will start five minutes be-
fore the football game against
Ripon and will end on the track
in front of the bleachers.

The addition of Bruce Beck-
ord, a Ietterman last year, and
the tremendous improvement
of Steve Brintnall, a sophomore
should help the \squad. Rod
Brown, last year's winner, and
captain Paul Patterson are
both running well although
Coach Dick Young is hoping for
better performances from both
of them. Senior letterman Clyde

From Abroad

A Sunday aftemoor. coilee

official opening of the 1964-65
Cosmopolitan Club. The main
purpose of the gathering was
to introduce Grinnell's new for-
eign students and this year’s
club officers to prospective
members of the club.

Two girls and two boys have
joined the foreign students on
the Grinnell campus for this
year. The girls are Sioe Thung
(known by the Dutch nickname
Weitje), a freshman from In-
donesia, and Rebecca George,
who is from Zanzibar, East
Africa. North campus additions
are Wallace Lowe, a senior who
was born In China but now lives
in Lima. Peru, and Thomas
Bao, who is from Uruguay.

The aim of the Cosmopolitan
Club, to increase the “mutual
understanding and contribu-
tions” of the American and for-
eign students, was explained
by Kunio Waki, president of the
club. He also introduced the
other members of the board:

Simone Hopeful—
Experienced Team
Strong in Practice

By Steve Casey

This year’s varsity soccer
team, according to Coach lrv
Simone, has the prospects of be-
ing as good as the 1963 team
that had a 6-2 record. Mr. Si-
mone is pleased with his team’s
practices up until now although
he thinks this team is now ln-'
ferior to the strong 1563 team
in conditioning.

The 1964 team is bolstered by
seven lettermen including the
two ctr-captains, Vincent Anku
and Fred Miller. There is also a
group of promising sophomores
up from last year’s freshmen
team that Coach Simone is
counting on.

The toughest matches for this
year will be on Saturday with
Illinois Normal and late r
matches with three of the top
teams in die area, Wheaten.
MacMurray, and Lake Forest.

The soccer team welcomes all
spectators. The matches start
at 11:30 and are over before the
football games start. There is
no admission fee to see the 1964
soccer team in action.
