Pornography Topic
Of tackliori‘ Talk

Professor William Lockhart,
Dean oi the University oi Minne—
sota’s Law School, addressed the
Gl'innell PrenLaw Club October 19,
on the subject of ”Pornography
and the Law."

After a special dinner attended
by club members, Locknart spoke
in the Forum’s South Lounge on

thle problem or censorship oi the
obsCEne and how the Supreme
Court has coped with the issue
in the past twelve years.

Obscenity and Sex

Lockhart emphasized that ob-
scenity and sex are not the same
and that “sex affects all man-
kind.“ Many problems have been
inflicted upon society because
man has groped in the dark be.
cause of sex taboos, according to
Lockhart. These taboos are being
challenged by law "where the ex-
act subject matter makes freedom
of expression essential."

Lockhart rirmly adheres to the
belief that a democratic society
must be free to pet-lect itself. in
light oi legal approval or Lady
Chatterly’s Lover in movie torm
in 1959, he emphasized that there
is a “constitutional right to advo—
cate adultery under certain cir-
cumstances.”

Protected from Nudism

Nevertheless, Lockllarl still
maintains that society should be
protected from “nudism to parade
on the streets of Grinnell” or
"tree love advocation on campus"
or even signboards advocating
sexual intercourse.

However, there is nothing wrong,
according to him, with reading
about such things, because an in
dividual does not have to read
anything—it is simply his privi-
lege to do so.

He adds, "There are all kinds of
stimuli in our society which stim-
ulate sex desires.” He then men-
tioned a past study conducted on
a large coeducational campus on
which the women were asked what
the greatest sexual stimulant was
The general reply was simply
“mend" Thus, Lockhart believes
that one cannot eliminate sex lrom
the world. it is ‘a part of society
—a part of life."

Concern Over Viet Nam

Suddenly the demonstrators have made us, the
Grinnell students, realize the concern over Viet Nam
more clearly.

They’re real students now, not just unseen critics.
VAnd they are students who have shared America with
us for about 20 years and who share our “conditioning"
to the problem of war.

Supposedly, we 20-year-olds have been led to re-
alize that many of the traditional views of war don't
fit the modern situation. Why, with the advances in
weaponry, are we fighting a “traditional” war? Why,
with advances in communications between nations, are
we fighting any war?

Supposedly, we 20-year-olds have been taught to
be open minded, and so we respect the views of people
who have lived through traditional wars, people who
think that demonstrations against the government's
stand in time of war is wrong.

Supposedly, we 20-year-olds ought to be respon-
sible to our government. It would be foolish to want to
try to undermine a system that allows the opportunity
to demonstrate as students are now doing.

Supposedly, also, we 20-year»olds have a commit-
ment to tell others how we feel a situation like Viet
Nam ought or ought not be handled. And why should
we let the rest of the country forget our feelings when
the deci on has been made against our favor?

Many students are demonstrating from a non-tra-
ditional, open-minded, edified, and idealistic stand-
point.

But they are being called cowards and communists.
They are detested and arrested. They burn draft cards
and get no understanding. They criticize and lower the
morale of our troops.

Is the student demonstrator being treated the right
way? By the time he is beaten by the angry survivors
of other wars, by the time he is called communist by
his government leaders, by the time he is fined lor
burning an insigniﬁcant piece of paper, he will prob-
lbly come to have doubts not only about the Viet Nam
situation but also about the intrinsic worth of a species
that knows what it is doing is wrong but that keeps it
up while bemoaning the lack of alternatives.

 

Educare Gives Faculty-Student Panel
Views Voiced on Discipline, Freedom

"Freedom and Discipline in
Higher Education” was the topic
or the second discussion sponsored
by Edueare. A panel consisting oi
Raymond liens (history) and Wal-

do Walker (biology) and students
Karen Lauicrbzich and Pete Koll-

Walker stated that ‘ nitial dis-
cipline is necessary to establish
the basic currency oi any held or
study." There was virtual agree-
ment on this point, but disagree-
ment over the extent to which
“entertainment” should be used to
motivate students.

Student Evaluation of Faculty
Given Official Status at Yale

By PAUL BRADLEY

Yale University has taken the
ill-st step in giving its students an
official voice in the appointment
of faculty members to tenure po-
silions. The university has invited
academically high-ranking stu-
dents to submit written appraisals
oi their educational experience in
lectures, discussions, and semi<
rial-s.

The move is part of the review
of Yale’s iaculty appointment sys-
tem and is an effort to turn the
threat that faculty members must

"publish or perish” into an admoni~
lion to “publish and teach or
perish." The review was ordered
alter heated controversy last
spring when Richard Bernstein,
associate proiessor oi philosophy,
was not promoted to the tenure
position at iuil proiessor. Students
had then demonstrated against
what they thought was a gross
injustice to an outstanding teach
er.

The Black Ind Blue Review has
rated science professors at

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the University of British Colum-
bia. The review, compiled from
questionnaires tilled out by 8,000
students last year, uses frank
language to describe the faculty.

of the 133 faculty members, 33
are considered outstanding and 60
are rated above average. After
compiling the questionnaires, the
review assigned grades irom ex4
cellent to very poor to each pro<
lessor. Reaction from professors
has been quite mixed depending
upon what the revtew said oi
them. but the dean of the faculty
of science is favorably impressed
with the report.

New ID cards have been issued
to college students in the area at
\Vestem Illinois who are over 21
years and desire positive prooi of
their legal age.

Tavern owners and liquor deal-
ci's requested these cards because
they can be held partly respon
sible if they sell alcoholic bever-
ages to a minor who presents falsi-
fied identification. Police chiefs in
Monmouth and Galesburg are con.
iident the cards cannot be falsified.

The ID card carries a snap-shot,
physical description, and the date
of birth. A copy of the birth cerr
uiicate is required to obtain the
card. Western Illinois tavern own-
ers will now only accept the new
ID cards, no draft cards or driv-

Searching For Comet, S 8 B News Team Journeys West

By Bob Hodierne
John Phillips
Henry Wilhelm
John Wolf

There was a kind of tense quiet
around the 5&3 workroom Wed-
nesday night as the paper was be-
ing put together. No one wanted
no say it, but everyone knew why:
The paper didn’t have The Big
Feature. Nothing to set it apart.
Nothing to make it stick out in
Ono’s mind.

It was mentioned offhandedly,
m passing. it was to he the brighte
est comet of the century and would
be visible that night.

“Why not," someone suggested,
'do a photo feature on the comet?”
It would rush the printer a bit not
getting the pictures until Thursday
afternoon, but for something this
big . . .

It was decided that the four of us
would get up at follr o’clock Thur
day morning, drive out into the
country, and take pictures. The
comet, it was reported, would be
most spectacular just before and
right at dawn.

From here on out the story of
the search for the comet is best
handled in straight chronology.

12:00 — it was still raining in
Grinnell and of course tlle cloud
cover would prevent comet photoe
graphing. We called the Des
Moines weather bureau. They said
It would clear up by 3:00 or 4:00
that morning We finished up with
the rest of the paper.

 

2:00 — We called Des Moines
again — just to he sure. They had
changed their minds. it was clear
in Omaha-Council Bluffs, they said,
but it was still raining in Des
Moines. At dawn all they would
promise would be clear skies about
30—40 miles west of Des Moines.
Their advice was if you want
comet pictures Go West Young
Man. The advice had a familiar
ring, we considered it brieﬂy, and
decided.

2:15 — After a stop to gather
supplies We were off. Essentially it
was the same team that had cov-

ered Selma last spring. We were
getting used to leaving on a mo-
ment's notice to get the story. We
had four cameras, nine different
lenses, two tripods, smoked glass,
lens tissues and film. We took a
special film with us, film ordered
directly from Kodak. it is the
World’s most light sensitive film
made especially for taking pic»
tures of things like stars —- and
comets. We were ready.

3:30 — it was raining quite hard
when we reached Des Moines, But
after all, the weatherman had said
30-40 miles west of Des Moines

and, besides, the country and
western disc jockey on WHO said
that the day would dawn clear and
with those two on your side . . .

5:00 -— At Atlantic, Iowa, we
were slowed to a near crawl it was
raining so hard. Arid (lawn was fast
opproaching. We kept heading for
the west and for the promised
clear skies.

6:30—We reached Council Bluffs
at dawn and, thank God, the skies
had started to clear. We found, ap-
propriately, a bluff from which we
could watch and photograph the
brightest col-net of the century.

"oven THERE . . . no, over fhere . . . no . . seemed to be the resenon at the sea news
team as they stood yesterday morning on a bluff outside Council Bluffs. They are ii. to r.)
Phillips. Wilhelm. Wolf. and Hodierne.

 

The wind on the bluff was co‘dv
damned cold, but we put our
cameras in place, took the light
readings, and were ready for our
photo feature — if only those
clouds right along the eastern
horizon would lift, We had read
that the comet would be visible
three diameters of the sun below
the sun. or, to be more pointed,
directly behind that bank of clouds
on the eastern horizon.

1:00 — It was broad daylight
and overhead there wasn’t a Cloud
to be seen — except alﬂrlg the east-
ern horizon, of course The sun
kept peeking about half its di<
ameter above the cloud bank but
the other half and, we presume,
the comet, remained safely hidden
from our Waiting, watching bank
of cameras.

7:30 — We ate breakfast at a
small diner in Council Bluffs and
the ,waitress didn't make any
comments about the beards or
Cameras. it was the highlight of
the trip, which gives you some idea
of what kind of trip it was.

8:00 — We started back — and
it was raining again. Someone in
the car read an account of the
comet sighting irom Hawaii. The
account said it was a spectacular
comet — the brightest of the cen-
tury —— in case you were wonder-
ing.

12:30 — We arrived hack on
campus — all of us having missed
all Of our Classes — which ranks
right up there with the waitress
as the trip’s highlight.

SCARLET AND BLACK

By PAUL ROBERTS

Recently I had the good fortune
to conduct a unique interview. It
was an interview between myself,
a Peace-in»VieteNam picket, and
a Hell’s Angelr

Normally I wouldn’t print this
interview because it doesn't really
apply itself too well to Grinnell life.
It deals with war. peace, life,
death, and other matters of simi-
lar lack of consequence to came
pus lire at Grinnell. 1 print it
because of a sudden interest in
these matters on campus Just
last week I heard reference to
Viet Nam in the lunch line And
then again this week passing ref-
erence was made in a political

In this tour or back stage we
have arrived at the person re-
sponsible really, basically respon-
sible for the whole show. It is he
who chooses the play, finds the
actors, delegates the authority for
the technical jobs, oversees both
the from stage and back stage
work and finally worries himself
sick on opening night. who is this
father-iigure. this supreme au«
thority and seat or all knowledge?
The director, or course.

The Grinnell theatre is extreme.
1y lucky to have available two
ﬁne directors; Mr. Edward (Ned)
Donahoe and Mr. Richard (Dick)
Meyer. Donahue is presently on
leave. so Meyer has assumed the
schedule. iie oversees not one play
but many; acting as supervisory
director for student directed workr
shops, balancing Roberts engage-
ments and the budget, and direct-
ing the major productions.

It all started with drama as an
extra-curricular activity in high
school. At Drury College in Spring-
iield, Mo, Meyer majored in Eng-
lish and art. But during this time
he was active in college drama,
and directed the Springfield Com-
mllnity Theatre. One summer va-
cation he acted and directed in a
television play which appeared on
the Eddy Arnold Show. Next, with
liberal arts degree in hand, he
went to Northwestern University.
where he got his master’s in thea-
tre, Arkansas State College
snapped him up. He headed their
drama department for tour years.
Notre Dame next had the good
tortune to have him as proiessor
of radio and television media in
their theatre department. But the
call of the small liberal arts col~
lege proved too much. Meyer leit
Notre Dame to come to Grinnell
in 1957.

On his last leave, Meyer was
assistant to Whitehead and Kazan.
Arthur Miller's newest play Aiter
the Fall was being produced at
Lincoln Center in New York and
Kazan and Whitehead were pro-
ducing it ior Miller. Meyer said at
Kazan: “He is one of the {ow
creative geniuses around. He is a
quiet-spoken man but there is a
ieeling of dynamic energy sur-
rounding him." Other words Mey-
er used were “no-nonsense” and
“magnetic." and there was much

respect in his voice.

When he returned from Lincoln
Center, Meyer wrote a hook on
his experiences in New York. He
has also had some academic pa-
pers published.

Since he has returned to the ac-
tive duty at Grinnell, Meyer has
produced and directed Oedipus
Rex (last fall term) and The
Knock (last week-end).

When he was asked what he
hopes for the iuture oi the drama
department, he spoke of integrat-
ing the theatre with the campus.
"The theatre is a part or life, it
is more than entertainment. It
should generate in campus theatre
a kind of academic enthusiasm al—
so." He also wishes to continue
the weekrinrNew York trips.

There are new tour workshops
in rehearsal: see How They Run,
The Physicists, The Bourgeois,
and Total Tlientre‘

Congressman to Be
Political Resident-

“Legislatlve Leadership in the
Great Society" will be the theme
of Rep. Cari Albert, (D-Okla.),
Majority Leader at the us.
House, when he visits Grlniiell
November 17 and 18 as “Politir
cianrlnrResidence”.

Rep. Albert has played a key
leadership role in the passage oi
medicare, aid-toreducation. and
excise tax cut legislation by the
39th Congress. He also supported
home rule tor the District or C0-
lumbia and repeal of section 14h
oi the Taft-Hartley Law.

Albert, a former Rhodes schor
lar, has been described by Time
as . .one of the sharpest politi-
cal proiessionals in Congress.”

He has compiled a liberal voting
record and has protessed faith in
the ability of the legislative branch
to eifectively meet the needs of
modern America. His Oklahoma
district has consistently re-elected
him to Congress by a 75 per cent
vote.

During his visit to Grinnell, Rep.
Albert will deliver a major lec-
ture, hold a press conference, and
meet with students at several in-
toi-mal gatherings,

Approximately 35 Grinnell stu-

alternoon to discuss the project
and to choose leadership tor the
Grinnell group.

A steering committee was chosen
on a volunteer basis. It is composed
oi chairman Bonnie Tinker, Dave

Susan Goldberg, Wendy Foreman
and Jeff Herl. Jean Vandervoort
and Nancy McCanon will act as
advisers to the committee. Jan

To begin the meeting, Andy

said, but could deteriorate badly

Various methods or collecting

Recent weeks have seen an ed-
ltying series of highly informative
articles concerning Grinnell, un-
illlder the above standard head
(which saves a great deal at work
tor Wednesday-nights headline
writersh You by now should be
tully aware of the state of Grin-
nell during the eras of your moth-
er, Grandfather, and greatruncle-
twiceremovedl i hope you've
caught our subtle editorial com-
ments, both the snide and the
profound Like, we’ve been trying
to tell you that things around here
don't change too much, and that
there is nothing new under the sun,
and such-like. In case not, here
we are again,

Five Years Ago

Something new, this week, how-
ever, . .0 look at the Grinneil we
ﬁrst heard of; the older genera»
tions of us, mat is. Grinnell may
or may not have meant much to
you live years ago, but it was
quite definitely here. And here too
were a lot of familiar-type sights
And gripes, and lot of things that
are now defunct—remembered on-
ly through the legends handed
down by Baffleboards and other
upperciassmen to this year's sen-
iors—with them to be lost or
preserved depending on the vaga—
ries 0t fate, and other eternal
tomes such as bad memories and
apathy. But there are always the
bound copies of the SH to keep
us informed, and to provide ﬁller
when there isn't eight pages of
new: going on in a week. . .

1960 was the year or the Nor-
rises, the construction at the line
art: building, and r new book-
store. The latter was hailed in
vol. 69, number 1 at the 5&3 for
its . .floar plan arranged by
one at the nation‘s foremost dc-
signers in this field.” That was on
page 1; page 4 featured a column
discussing the ins and out of the
honored Mr. Wassom’s distrust of
the student body of Grinnell. .
and nobody bothered to remember
the name of that foremost designv
er, either.

Hypocritieal Liberalily

Open dorms started their second
year of hypocritical liberaiity in
1960, and the first encampment
was held Discussion topics in-
cluded curriculum, an honor code.
religion, social life, and student-
faculty relations The language lab
was opened soon after the begin-
ning oi classes, and the “Covered
Wagon" entered the scene.

Campus problems were few in
1950, mostly dealing with the not-
qnite (mercifully) eternal prep
ping controversy. A large part oi
the Grinneii community that year
found the worldly affairs of the
nonsacademic community more
worthy of their concern. The
rest managed to create a comma
vorsy out of this participation in
world controversy. The 5&3 fea-
tured a political editor in 1960451,

 

and several columnists who found
man's rockets more worthy of
concern than the Rocket Man. The
Kennedy-Nixon campaign, disarm-
ament, and the Cuban invasion
were ample cause [or numerous
meetings, lectures, and picketing
both off campus and on, Even the
Military Ball was picketed.

Cracks in the cloistered walls
of Grinnell’s isolation came in
two now»unavailahle ways during
this yearl KGRW, the college‘s
own radio station, was still a go—
ing concern in those days. (It’s
last gasp, as l remember, was
the broadcast of the SGA conven.
tion in spring of 1963, after a year
of silence.) And there was B col-
iee house, No, it didn’t have glass
walls and an espresso machine of
scandalous expense. It had i. small

type beverages, And folk-singers,

liberal arts college cannot be all
things to all men and still keep
its integrity of locus and purpose,"
Leggett continued.

The president's speech was en»
titled "The College President as

a typical freshman boy who comes

vironmeut to the uncertain atmos-
phere of college lite.

President Leggett said, “The
truth is that a college, partly by
accident and partly by tradition
and design, serves as a catalyst,
as an agent for bringing the odds
and ends of emerging maturity
and its correlated confusions and
irustrations to a focus,”

The president reassured parents
by saying, “lt seems to me that
the essential usefulness of parents
increases as their day-hy»day cone
trol over their college-age children
decreases."

In conclusion. President Leggelt
stated, “A college president who
does his job properly looks at a
student through many eyes—
teacher. parent, institutionalist,
emissary tor the future.

in helping the student grow into

Grit/men Try for Third Straight
At Beloit Homecoming Tomorrow

By STEVE CASEY

For the third time in their first
four games. the Pioneer football
team scored late in the game to
pull out a victory. Last Saturday
bgainst Monmouth, Tom Hill scored
On a pass from Barry Anderson,
and Paul Thurston kicked the ex-
tra point with 2:31 left in the

lame to give the Pioneers a

D~19 lead. Then after Bob Watt
intercepted a pass, Watt ran 41
yards to bring the score to 26-19,

This week the Pioneers will be
playing Beloit at their homecom-
ing. Beloit at the beginning of the
year was slated as one of the
toughest teams in the conference.
They started off in good fashion
by beating C09 and Knox. But the
last two weeks they have been
humbled by Carleton and St. Olaf,
The Buccaneers though possess
the league’s leading offense and
according to Coach Bowers are
particularly adept at getting the
quick score by a long run or pass,
Bowers is worried because this
has been the weak spot of the
Pioneer defense that has been gen-
erally strong this year.

The Pioneers were trounced at
the Beloit homecoming last year.
2444.

Next week the Pioneers will also
play in another homecoming at
Lawrence against the current co-
leaders of the conference.

A couple of lineup changes are
in prospect, according to Coach

Bowers. Phil Woodward will re-
place Ken Augustine, who will de-
vote his time to defensive tackle.
Dick Lamb will also see more ac-
tion at defensive tackle in addi-
tion to sharing the oiiensive Tulle
back slot with Jon Boswell. Lamb
played most of the time on of-
fense against Monmouth es Bus-
well was slowed by a leg injury,
but Jon is expected to be ready
for full time dllty Saturday.

The Pioneers this week were
led by halfback Bob Watt who
gained a net total of 192 yards in
twenty carries. Also contributing
were fullback Dick Lamb, with
net 78 yards. and John Shierholz
with 40 yards. in all the Pioneer
rushers were able to grind out
336 yards compared to the Mon-
mouth 89, But the Pioneers were
only able to rack up 37 yards by
passing. This and the couple quick
scores that Monmouth got kept the
game close and forced the Pie
neers to come from behind.

Both the Pioneers and Monmouth
brought new types of defenses to
the game and the first quarter
was spent by both teams experi-
menting, trying to find each oth-
ers weaknesses.

The first time the Pioneers got
the ball, they were able to drive
to the Monmouth 19. There Paul
Thurston tried a field goal but
it hit the posts and bounced the
wrong way. The second Pioneer
drive took them to the Monmouth
so, but an interception gave Mon~
mouth the ball back. As the first
quarter ended, the Pioneers had
just received a punt on their own
25.

A Barry Anderson-John Shier-
holz pass and a Dick Lamb run
brought the ball to the 43. After
another play, Bob Watt burst
through the line and was in the
open for a second, but was hauled
down at the Monmouth 23. Two
more runs by Lamb and Watt car-
ried the ball to the eight. There
Shierholz took a hand-off, bounced
off a couple tacklers at the three,
and scored. Thurston converted
and the Pioneers had a 74) lead.

But Monmouth came right back
to score in nine plays climaxed
by a Zdeyard pass from Jim Pa-
larski to John Stergulz. The con-
version was missed to give the

Pioneers a 776 lead which they
took to the locker room.

But at the start of the second
half, Monmouth grabbed the lead.
After the Pioneers received the
kick-off, they were forced to kick.

play of the drive. Dick Summer-
hill drove over from the two. the
kick was made, and Monmouth
had a 1377 lead.

But the Pioneers came roaring
back. Three first downs brought
the ball to the Monmouth 25. Here

tacklers. Scored. The referee ruled
the extra point attempt was wide
and the game was knotted lsela.

But the tie was quickly erased
Rob Beyer, a 9.3 sprinter, picked
up the kickoff at the fifteen near
the Grinnell sideline, raced across
the field, and outran the Pioneer
defenders to score. 0n the extra
point, the Pioneers were penalized
to the one-yard line where a Mon-
mouth Z-point attempt was smoth-
ered by the Pioneer line.

After an exchange of punts. the
Pioneers started a drive on the
Monmouth 47. Ten runs and three
first downs brought the ball to the
Monmouth ten. But with 7:40 left
in the game, the Pioneers fum-
bled and Monmouth recovered.

But the Pioneer defense held
and Monmouth Was forced to kick.
Kent Thomson, after calling for a
fair catch, was tackled. This pen.
alized Monmouth fifteen yards to
their own 29, Here Watt carried
twice to give the Pioneers a first
down on the 16. Three more car-
ries brought up a fourth down and
one inch on the six, Here Barry
Anderson snuck for the first down.
On the second down Anderson hit
Hill on a beautiful roll~out pass
for the tying score, Thurston con
verted and the Pioneers owned a
20-19 lead.

After the kick-off, Watt picked
off a pass at midfield and on the
second play went off tackle, broke
to the outside, and scored the final
touchdown.

Defeat Scots;

Improved Team Travels to Beloil

By BOB KATZ

The outlook is becoming bright-
er for the 1965 cross country
team. The squad, as a whole, put
on a fine performance for the
homecoming crowd in defeating
Monmouth 2|) - 34. Coach Dick
Young was pleased with the fact
that each of the top six runners
for Grinnell bettered his best pre<
vious time for the four mile
course.

Jeri Langham led the team in

ach ailment. Neither was able to
finish the race.

Tomorrow the harriers will
travel to Beloit for a dual meet.
Beloit ran in the Les Dukelnvita-
tional meet and was not impres-
sive. However, they were without
their two best runners, both of
whom will compete tomorrow.
Hartman, Beloit's best runner, is
the defending conference cross
country champion, Grinnell’s su-
perior team depth should prevail,
though, as it did last Saturday.

JERI LANGHAM was the top Grinnell finisher in the Home-

coming cross country meet,

took that meet 20-34.

He finished second. Grinnell

 

placing second with a time of
21:42, 14 seconds beltlnd Doug
Carlson of Monmouth. John
Sharpe captured third place, trail-
ing Langharn by 15 seconds. Steve
Britnall and Bob Grant finished
fourtll and fifth with respective
times of 22:31 and 22:36. Grant
showed the greatest improvement
on the squad, bettering his best
preVlous effort by 41 seconds.

Doug Dray, also much im-
proved. placed sixth With a time
of 23:04. Ric MacDowell. in the
seventh spot, trailed Dray by ten
seconds. Spence Clark’s time of
24:17 put him ahead of the third
Monmouth runner. There were
some dim notes from Saturday's
race, which may damage the
team’s future, Bob Dyer, who had
been recovering well from an ear-
ly season illness. suffered a
sprained ankle, and Dick Lovell

 

sustained a recurrence of a stom-
