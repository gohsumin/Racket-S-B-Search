Reaction to Selma

From 5&3 Writer

Ed. Note: The following dis-
patch was sent from Selma,
Alabama, Monday morning by
5&3 associate editor Bob Ho-
dierne.

Four of us, Henry Wilhelm,
John Phillips, Harold Fuson and
I, decided Tuesday afternoon of
last week that we had to go to
Selma. We left that night.

It was a ZUrhour ride in Wil-
helm’s well-traveled. nearelegene
dary VW. We stopped in Mont-
gomery Wednesday night, At that
time demonstrators were Still
standing on the capital lawn.

The next morning we drove to
Selma, a wealthy town of some
28,000. It's an old town with old
customs, The customs are hard to
change and that, perhaps as much
as anything, is why it was chosen
for this drive.

The news releases from Selma
give a fairly accurate description
of what has happened here. That’s
not the whole story,

One drives into Selma and ens
ters a never-never land. it’s kind
of an Alfred Hitchcock version of

The area where the Negroes

marized Wednesday night his
experiences in Selma, Alaba-
ma. His talk was the kick—off
of a series of dinners on civil
rights sponsored by the Board
of Religion.

"Songs and chaotic impresA
sions are whirling around in
my head," he said, “I’ve had
seven days of Southern fried
chicken, and I weep at the re-
markable graciousness of Dr.
Vivian and all the rest. My
mind and heart are back in
Selma. What I have learned
there, I'm not sure I can de-
scribe or accept or believe. But
I know that non-violence is a
viable alternative to brutality
and barbarism and that it
holds great hope to all men.”

Dewey described the South
ern Christian Leadership Con-
(SCLC)—its role and
philosophy. “To the SCLC,” he
said," the issue is not just the
Negro or voting rights, but the
issue is man. The issue is how
:to change the structures of
evil so that all men can be free.
The flagrant injustiCe to the
Negro is the immediate focal
point, and the effort is to raise
this issue of conscience to the
level of humanity‘s consci-
ence."

Dewey was impressed by the

total commitment of everyone
in SCLC to non-violence. In a

very easily provoke violence;
SCLC leaders, though, cau-

tained a tight control at all
times on the demonstrators.
These marchers themselves
showed a "tremendous sense
of rellowship, of community,
and humor, They Weren’t con-
fined: they confined the pod
lice.” ,

Dewey termed Clark’s posse
“ludicrous” against this non-
violent army, “He's more
scared than I am,” Dewey
heard a little Negro say while
looking at the 'mamnioth bulk
of an armed state trooper.

But ludicrous or not, violence
occurred, and Dewey ex-
pressed some reservation at
the nonrviclent approach. say-
ing, “Nor would I pretend it

there was terrible frustration,

A combination of factors brought
interest in the civil rights mow
ment, and especially the voter reg-
istration drive in Alabama, to 1
high level on campus this week.

Four Grinnell students undef-
took a journey to Selma to looli
into the situation and report it to
the 58:3. (See story at left and
pictures on pages 6 and 7.)

A local minister represented his
state conference in demonstra-

ranged for C. T. Vivian of SCLO
to speak to the college commu.
nity via long distance telephone.

Dewey described the atmos-

He said people were milling

The rope and the bridge have
become symbols for the civil

“Another fear of the white
Citizens in the South is that
Negro emancipation is causing
loss of his status and dignity."
Dewey continued. Dewey point-
ed out that if Negroes are
enfranchised, influential men in
the Selma community, like
Sheriff James Clark, will be
removed from power.

“Releasing the white man

concern of the Southern Chris

non-violent philosophy,” Dewey
noted. “In this sense, human
rights, not just civil rights, are
at stake."

Speaking of his own expert

Dewey also participated in
the attempted integration of a

Dewey said the minister of the
church refused entrance to the
{integrated group, saying, “You
‘are making a mockery of our
religion," but that several
members of the church and
other Selma citizens offered
verbal encouragement to the
group.

Sieve Shender
School for Young Apes

There was once, in a farmf jungle, B survival
school for young apes. It was a small school, as
these things go, but it was a very famous one, and
young apes, male and female, flocked to it from
all parts of the jungle. The school’s curriculum, ac-
cording to its catalogue, was designed to educate
the students in all aspects of LIFE. The wide spec»
trum of courses offered included such refined ones
as “History of Ape Thought" and “Ape Art —- From
Ugh to Oobanga," as well as practical courses in
jungle survival such as “Lower Order Group Con-
trol," dealing mainly with herd psychology, and
“Digital Manipulation 222" for advanced inﬁghting
with clubs and rocks.

However, in spite of the Wide and varied cur-
riculum. it came to he felt by the faculty and the
students that the school was not adequately prepar-
ing its scholars for the REAL THING. When the
young apes returned to their homes during vacations,
they were impressed by the vast gap between life at
the school, to which may had become accustomed,
and the Vicious, ape—eatrape chimp race of LIFE
in the rest of the jungle. The faculty had long been
aware of this problem, and although they themselves
were not particularly upset by it, they were some-
what concerned for the sake of those young apes
who were not destined to become academicians.
Some iaculty members suggested the curriculum
be expanded to include new courses such as “Ad-
vanced Breast Beating” or “Group Cooperation,"
but this was not what the students wanted.

“We can't escape this gilded palm tree by tak-
ing more courses." grunted one young ape. "The
problem is that when we come here we simply sub-
stitute the conmil of the faculty for the control of
our kinrgl'oup. What we need is more independence
and the right to run our own affairs." Alter much
hair tearing and breast thumping on the part of
the students and discussion on the part of the facul-
ty, it was finally agreed that the young ape had a
valid point and the students were allowed to estab-
lish their own government, the AST (Associated
Student Tribe). »

For a time. everyone was convinced that a
happy solution had been found which would allow
the young apes to learn about LlFE and get an
education at the same time. But alas, this happy
interlude was only the proverbial calm before the
storm, and when the storm broke, the coconuts
began to fall thick and fast.

A seemingly innocent misdemeanor on the part

of one freshman ape marked the beginning of the
tempest. One night, during mid-semester exams
he was seen swinging through the trees in ihe
males’ compound, at a speed well over the pre-
scribed limit, dropping coconut rinds and banana
peels indiscriminately on the heads of sleepers be»
low. it was later established by fellow students,
after his apprehension, that he had become de-
pressed after “bombing" his exam in lion psychol-
ogy and had proceeded to get soused on a quart of
fermented coconut milk.

being justly proud of their new right to govern
themselves rather than hush the incident in order
to protect the offender from severe faculty recrlm-
inations, his fellow students took him before the AST
Tribunal. That august body, after much deliberation,
fined him ten couch shells and warned him that in
case of a second offense, he would not escape With
sucll a light punishment. The matter was considered
done with, and the students, pleased by their ability
to render JUSTICE, returned to their Studies.

However, in the eyes of the FTS (the Faculty
Truth Squad, a committee established by the pro~
fessors in order to keep tabs on the AST), the case
was far from concluded. In a secret meeting, cone
ducted at night in the heights of a secluded palm
tree, they decided that the punishment had been too
mild and that it was necessary to intervene in order
to remind the students who was really running the
school. The young offender was subsequently sus<
pended for three weeks.

Reaction from the student body was Swift “1
coming. The AST tribunal chief lodged a formal
protest with the faculty, saying that the Truth Squad
had violated a fundamental area of student jurisdic»
lion, and furthermore, that the Squad’s very ex-
isiniice was a insult to student integrity. The FTS
replied with the statement that the students didn't
have any rights other than ihnse the faculty chose
to grant them, and that “there's no such thing as
‘siudent integrity,‘ ”

Still hoping to resolve the conflict through an
appeal to reason, the AST issued a rather extensive
statement which said in essence that student-faculty
relations Could only be based on trust and that Stu—
dents could hardly be expected to be responsible
when the FTS refused to recognize them as mature
monkeys, There was no reply by the faculty at this
"me,

Shades of Gray
Shooting From the Hip

By Carl Otis Gray

What’s hipness? it seems that hipness implies
an awareness of being of your own time and having
the ability to communicate it. A hipster is some»
one who is aware, very much‘ aware, of what could
happen and what should happen in his particular
flow of experience. So say the experts who in {his
case happen to be The Village Voice, Greenwich
Village’s own peculiar version of the Scarlet and
Black.

Using the definitions put forth and current
trends in American student opinion I can only
reach the conclusion that hipness is very desirable,
extremely glamorous and highly prestigious among
this college generation. This is as it should be,
After all we are a generation spawned during a
world war, weened during an international police
action, and matured during a period of hostility
whose overt manifestations Could mean total de-
struction of our planet. During our lifetimes it is
doubtful that we have ever experienced one day
when a human life was not taken as a result of
international conflict. I therefore assume ihat we
have a right and a duty to be hip.

Awareness of one's tllne suggests a recognition
of ‘rill the social, political, and personal issues that
affect us. The ability to communicate suggests an
involvement. It IS obvious that it is impossible to
lake thcse sintements literally and attempt to em-
brace the problems of the world one by one. What
is necessary is a certain abstraction, a neat gener-
alization that can serve as the basis [or the indi-
viduals functioning as a hipster.

l'.’ .

i It).

Whether or not I consider myself a hipster is
not in question here. but looking around me l can
discern, in this pioneer of the midwestern educa-
tional traditions, very few. lf we are aware of the
problems we certainly don’t go out of our way to
communicate this awareness. Far from playing
the sophisticated Easterner in the wilderness of
midwestern traditionalism, provincialism, and iso-
lationism, I am appalled by our complacency and
apathy here at Grinnell. From the success of the
Grinnell Civil Rights Group and the reaction to
U.S. military actions in Viet Nam, I can only see
looming in large neon lighting that obscenity at
Obscenities — SQUARE.

Let’s face it. We are unable to look beyond the
physical boundaries of this institution. Even in our
dealings with our own internal problEms we lack
the sophistication and imagination in deal with
thESE issues in a creative manner. We lack the
initiative to take firm stands: we possess a wonder-
ful ability to procrastinate and vaccilate. if all
these symptoms are merely a local phenomenon,
as I am convmcod they are, then 1 suggest we
voluntarily quarantine ourselves — apathy is con-
tagious.

Like apathy, hipness is also contagious -
pruhably their only common factors. If other insil~
tutions of similar merit have been struck with III
it’s our turn to contract it. With the loss of apalhy
should go our own naive conceptions and illusions
about ourselves and our society. With the advent of
hipness should come some dynamism and leader-
ship.

Come on, hipness is sweeping the country ——
let's get into the mainstream.

As Grinnell students we are
often criticized for our appar-

almost inevitably thwarted, We
are disappointed at such seem-

dent creativity. Rather than an
attitude or contining attempts
at creativity. we would like to
see originality watched and en-
couraged joyously and with
pride. Therefore, a re-evalua-

icy to a level consistent with
what the college stands for.

To Most Everyone

To the Editori

After careful reading of the
SH! 0! the past lew weeks i
feel the need to make a remark

01' two before the contributors
to the “Letters to the Editor"
column lose all sense of pro-
portion.

First or all, with regard to
Herzog’e opinion of student
government, perhaps some of
the purposes of our time spent
in college should be re-stated.
The process of obtaining an ed-
ucation is basically an egotisti-
cal affair. Part of this process,
for those with galloping cases
or self-importance, involves
playing around in student poli-
tics. Fortunately, most stu-
dents are apathetic to student
politics and do not interlere
with the game. There is no
point in taking the game away
from those who wish to play it,
No one Advocates the removal
of games which other students
engage in.

Since the obtaining of a col-
lege diploma is a basic qualiti-
cation to .be fulfilled before one
canﬁo anything useful in life,
students should do whatever
they wish to make their Shel»
tered environment more inter-
esting. This probably includes
thmwing snowballs through
windows (in answer to Mr.
Kurasch) or writing letters to
the newspaper with the pur—
pose of stirring up the sensitive
emotions of various people (in
answer to Mr. Cleaver). There
may be limits which should be
applied to some of the games
students engage in, but I won-
der what they are.

Perhaps we would all he bet-
ter off if We went back to our
copies of Palmer, Samuelson,
etc., and didn't bother With
these games. However, we
would probably soon become
cases for our inadequate coun-
selling services.

To the Editors

While sitting in the Forum
recently, i happened to even
hear two professors discussin‘
the merits or inter-collegiate
athletics. Both believed that
the administration and silk
dents were placing too much
emphasis upon such an unre-
warding endeavor, and that
the college could use the fund:
for higher or nobler purposes
while students could use the
time for intellectual pursuits.

This conversation exempli-
fies the attitude of many on the
Grinnell campus. One can see

that the number of students in-
terested and dedicated enough
to engage in inter-collegiate
athletics has been on the down-
swing during the past iew ren-
sons. '

John Piitsch, head basketball
and assistant football coach,
defines the problem, “It's not

only that the number of stu-
dents out for inter-collegiate
sports has declined over the
last two years. Perhaps more
serious than this is the fact
that those who are out to com-
pete, generally speaking, have
lost their competitiveness and
devotion. Their aim seems to
be to stay on the squad, in—
stead of to help the squad
win.”

This letter is designed to
serve as a reminder of the
values of athletic pal‘ticipa‘
tion. This participation should
be strongly encouraged in an
environment like ours. The ac-
tivity itselt offers a pleasant
change of pace to a life 0:
solid studying, the physical ex-
ertion offers a chance to rid
Oneself of natural aggressions
and emotions, and also it en-
ables one to meet others out-
side of one’s hall who are de-
voted to an identical aim.

The case Should not be over-
Stated nor the benefits of ath-
letics over-emphasized. Grin-
nell makes the facilities avail-
able, but unfortunately they
are being ignored by many
who could gain immensely.
More participants, not spec,
tutors, more people to join the
athletics and not to watch
them, should be encouraged by
a proper atmosphere.

Ford Describes
Republican Role

By Pam Clay

House minority leader Ger-
ald Ford spoke via telephone
to the Grinnell Young Repuhli
cans Wednesday on "The John-
son Legislation —— A Republi~
can Alternative,"

Ford Said that the Republi-
cans in the legislative branch
are raced with overwhelming
opposition in Congress and
awesome strength in the execu-
live.

He enumerated five respone
sibilities of the minority party:
1) exert its influence in both
branches of Congress for the
Republican goals of freedom,
national security, and peace;
2) support the Democratic ad-
ministration When we think it
is right and oppose it when we
think it is Wrong; 3) point out
any failures of the Democratic
administration: 4) continue and
expand our efforts for a strong
two party system; 5) work to
maintain and expand unity in
the Republican ranks.

A major innovation is the
Task Force System on a ma-
jor scale—vworking on research
in depth on agriculture, voting
rights, education. etc. It aims
toward long range solutions to
national and international
problems.

Representative Ford stressed

that the Republican Party‘s in-
fluence ”must be not only per-
sistent oppositioanhis is too
narrow and limited." An ex-
ample oi Republican backing
of an administrative position
is the agreement on the policy
for Viet Nam. The Republicans
agreed with the stepped up ac-
tion and the refusal to with-
draw. “There is a big differ—
ence in defense on the United
States ten yard line rather than
the enemy's."
, Republicans have offered al-
ternatives to several adminis-
trative programs, including
that on Federal Aid to Educa-
tion and Medicare The Repub-
lican alternative to Medicare
has already been recognized
as better by the Committee on
Ways and Means. In this case
the administration is on the de-
fensiv .

’ SCI C's Vivian Phones Toll! Here,
Discusses Non- Violence Philosophy

“Non-violence to us is more
than not fighting back," C. T.
Vivian, President of Affiliates
of the Southern Christian Lead«
ership Conference, told about
500 Grinnell students by long
distance telephone Monday
night.

He continued, “It is the mat-
ter of raising issues to the
level of consciousness to so
great a degree that everyone
within ,society must see himr
self. We reached that high
point today in Selma, Alabama,
beCause for the first time We
really got the church involved
in the movement.”

Vivian explained the basic
non-violent philosophy of SCLC.
He repeated that ﬁ‘unearned suf-
fering brings creative change,
and it works every, every
time."

He explained the manner in
which SCLC sees its philosophy
manifest in results.

“A leader is a person with
followers. If you know how to
mass a movement, if you know
how to plan one, if you’ve got
the skills and understanding
and a sense of history, than
you can make gains step by
step to change the society in
which you live. Raise the is-
sues so positively to the level
of consciousness that all men
must look at what you’re say-
ing and realize that the word
has become flesh. But we know
this—that unearned suffering
is redemptive and it brings
change.”

Vivian said that the move
ment is making new allies for
the non-violent philosophy.
“Sometime on the non-violent
road, I hope we’re able to see
labor present itself as we’re
able to see the Church pre-
sent itself, and we'll know then
that we have the ally of forces
that we need to really see the
kind of change in American so—
ciety that we need," he said.

He continued, “We can be
able to deal with the great so-
cial problems of our time with
a force of the people. We can
say with the President, ‘We
shall overcome’,”

“Our work is designed to
create an atmosphere in which
democracy can exist. so that
we have no need for another
‘ocracy’ or another ‘ism.’ And
this is basic to our understand»
ing," Vivian said.

“You can have a decent so-
ciety, based upon love, truth,
justice, if you’ve got enough
guts to suffer for it. And that
is the kind of new society that
we’re really talking about,” he
added.

Further explaining the non-
violent philosophy of sch, he
said. "This kind of thinking
does not come easy, and people
who want to be angry and
throw things don’t quite under-
stand it. But I think we Can
see it here (in Selma). As the
unearned suffering of the Rev.
James Reeb has brought the
Church to the Southern civil
rights movement."

“Peace is the presence of
love and of understanding and
of good will. If we can gener-
ate, through crisis, an under-

 

standing of how we really live
With one another, then we can
begin to restructure and begin
to live like we ought to live,
and this is what U16 non-violent
movement is saying, that it
needs the allies to do this. To-
day the ally of the Church

that are given them, to be able
to reach for these things that
their minds are able to imag-
ine," Vivian asserted.

“Selma has lifted the issues
to the conscience of mis na-
tion,” he Concluded.

“It is only a non-violent

ferring to that line of police as the
“perimeter," a military term
which, unfortunately, is all too
accurate.

Outside that "perimeter” is a
town full of people who are hav—
ing zoo-year customs changed in

a point of justification for any—
thing they've done or will do. It’s
simply a point one has to remem-
her in dealing with them and try-
ing to understand them.

It goes without saying that these
people hate Negroes. Even more
they hate the press which exposes
them to the world. But even more,
they hate the northern college stu-
dent. The four of us are an unforr
tunate combination — northern
college student pressmen.

Selma Benefits

A voluntary fast from the
evening meal served in the col-
lege dining rooms will be held
Wednesday night. The money
saved by not serving the meal
will be sent to the Southern
Christian Leadership Confer-
ence to help defray medical ex»
pauses and cost of food during
the recent demonstrations in
Selma, Alabama.

Each participant in the fast,
in addition to missing the meal,
will contribute 50c when he
registers for the fast.

A service will be held in Her-
rick Chapel during the dinner
hour Wednesday for fast par-
ticipants.

The fast is being organized
by an ad hoc student Commit-
tee composed of representas
tives from several campus or
ganizations.

“His leadership had been
challenged because of the int:

then that he appealed to the
church for support in his ef-
forts," Dewey explained. “His
appeal had been answered, and
this was his moment of Vic~
tory.”

Dewey noted that the press
has covered the situation in
Alabama very thoroughly, but
has never looked closely at the
philosophy of non-Violence. C.

Dewey outlined the process
of Voter registration in Selma.
For protection, Negroes are
forced to go to polling places
in groups. But a group must
stay at least a block away or
stand in contempt of court. A
group might mill around the
courthouse for eight hours be-
fore they are given individual
numbers.

The number-holder must wait
a month and then return to the
courthouse (remaining one
block away) and wait for his
number to be Called. His num-
ber is called twice, and if he
should not be able to hear his
number, he must return in one
month and repeat the entire
process. If his number is called

Dewey noted that Selma has
a population of about 30,000—
half Negro and half white. of
the whites 9,000 are registered

Donahoe Outlines leMoyne Stay;
Wants Greater Faculty, Exchange

sy Pam Clay

Ned Donahoa (speech and
theatre) is back on the Grin-
nell campus after spending last
semester teaching at LeMoyne
College, Memphis, Tenn. Don-
ahoe said that he hopes more
Grinnell Iaculty will be able to
go to Le‘Moyne and that some
LeMoyne faculty can come to
Grinnell.

Ha lelt that‘his semester at
LeMoyne was a great learning
experience for all concerned
Ind said enthusiastically, "I
wish I were back."

Donahoe's wife and his
daughter accompanied him to
the Negro college with which
Grinnell has an exchange pro-
gram. His seventh — grade
daughter was tutored by col-
lege students rather than at~
tending the public school there.
Scott, the Donahoe's high-school
nged son, stayed here in or-
der to aid the Grinnell high
school basketball team. .
l “I asked that we live on
campus,” said Donahoe. “Much
of the faculty lives in an area
called White Haven, but I
wanted to be easily accessible
to the drama students."

He said that throughout the
semester ﬁle number of stu-

 

had increased and he was de-
cidedly please that he had chos-
en to live on campus.

Dunahoe taught in o d is rn
drama, world literature, and
speech. The speech class was
composed primarily of students
planning to teach who wanted
experience in communicating

“My main job was to make
recommendations as to wheth—
er a drama program was feasv
ible or not,” he said “There
are no dorms at LeMoyne, it
is a ‘streetcar college’ and this
greatly complicates the produc-
tion of a play. The play was
necessarily prefabricated, We
had to work with small sections
whenever the students could get
together and lit the play togeth-
er at the end."

Donahue was told that only
eight people would turn out to
see the play, The Flies. by
Jean Paul Sartre, but. it ran
four nights. ‘

"There was lots or enthusi.
asm there for something worth»
while and lots of untapped dra»
matic ability,’ he said. ,

There is nc permanent dra-
ma program at LeMoyne but,
because of the quality and
quantity of response to the play
he produced, Donahue is writ-
ing and urging that they do in—
augurate a permanent pro-

dents who dropped in u: talkl gram.

Thomas Describes

Returning from an 18 month

Philip S. Thomas, (economics)

whole of his experience when
he says he “loved itr"

Besides doing a good deal of
research in the area of inter-
national economics for the
Pakistan Institute of Develop-

also accomplished a new first
for a Grinnetl professor—vhe
was featured in a spread for
Life magazine, which anyone
must admit is a bit of a jump
from the 8&1}.

While vacationing in Kash-
mir, as did the Mogul emper-
ors when they needed to get
away from it all, the Thomas
family happened to bump into a
Life photographer who was
hunting for an American fam-
ily which he could photograph.
and so the photographer had
his pictures and the Thomases
had B "lot of fun.”

Not a newcomer.to the area.
having.worked as a Fulbright
scholarin New. Delhi, Thomas
went to Karachi with the ex-
pressed desire to master the
Irdu language, worked diligent-
ly an hour a day for several
months on it, and was some»
what dismayed to discover that
English is the official language
used in all economic writing
there and Sind is the language

Buoy Describes liberiun Soiourn;
‘ Cuttington Stay Provides Insight

By Kris Nash

Liberia, West Africa, is a na-
tion of sharp contrasts, From the
modern coastal city of Monrovia
to the unexplored bushland of the
interior, from the educated stu-
dents and teachers of the colleges
to the tribal natives who have nev-
pr seen a white man, from the
numerous areas exhibiting West-
orn influence to the primitive cus-
toms of the bush which are often
steeped in magic and superstition
~ in these and in various other
segments of Liberian life are
found constant reminders of the
great paradox which the culture
of this country currently repre-
sents.

Liberia has been the home of
Dirk Baay (German) for this past
11 months. Easy and his wife and
family lived on the campus of
cuttington College, 120 miles from
the coast. Though said to ha lo-
cated in the village of Suacoco,
Cuttington is actually situated in
the open bush, With primitive na-
tive settlements existing perhaps
a mile from the campus.

Serving as I Fulbright-Hays
Visiting lecturer, Baay taught
freshman English and American
literature at Cuttington, one of Li-
beria’s two colleges.

Baay described Monrovia, the
Liberian capital, as “a sizeable
city,” containing several super-
markets, and large office build-
ings in the downtown sector. Traf-
fic in Monrovia resembles that In
western cities, with taxis the chief
means of transportation.

Cuttington is a liberal arts col-
lege offering a degree in agricul-
ture, as well as the standard 3.5.
_tnd BA. certificates, The school’s
li-member faculty serves an en-
rollment of about 200 students,
three-fourths of which are Liber-

ians. While most students come
from high schools in Monrovia'
there are some enrolled who re-
ceived their secondary level edu-
cations at mission schools in the
bush. Such pupils lack the cultural
development of the Monrovlans,
but otherwise are scholastically
competent.

Since there are no utilities, Cut-
tington has a generator and pro
duces its own electricity. There is
a college dining room, though
Baay and his family lived in a
separate three-room unit contain-
ing a refrigerator and electric
range. Baay revealed that the wa-
ter throughout Liberia holds the
threat of dysentery and typhoid
fever, and is therefore unfit to
drinlr.

Classes at Cuttington are not
overcrowded with the student body
still relatively small, but the dor-
mitory facilities are definitely
cramped. Four students are its
ually forced to occupy a room
scarcely spacious as a Grinnell
"double."

Occasional concerts by visiting
groups are also presented in Mons
rovia, and plays are staged from
time to time by amateur groups
The amateur theatrical group at
Cuttington recently presented a
Gilbert and Sullivln operatta, un-
der the direction of a faculty ads
visor on dramatic: and assisted
by Mrs. Buy. On an even larg<
er scale was a production of “Mars
der in the Cathedral," which was
put on not only at the college, but
in Monrovia and other cities in
the upland interior.

The studant who played the lead
in “Murder in the Cathedral” is
a native boy, president of the stu-
dent body, whom easy is ins
terested in bringing to Grinnell
next year as a senior.

Baay was active in the athletic
scheme at Cuttington by serving
as chairman of the athletic com-
mittee and coaching the soccer
team. Soccer is the most popular
game in West Africa. Baay em-
phasized that the quality of Liber-
ian play in such contests as bas-
ketball and track has been greatly
increased as a result of better or-
ganization in these areas at Mon-
rovian high schools.

Just as in Monrovia, the scat
tered expanses of native quarters
— with their rnud huts, capped by
corrugated-iron roofs —- supply
blatant contrast to the metropoli~
tan ﬂavor of the downtown office
buildings, so in the interior the na-
tive tribal villages clash with the
atmosphere of Cuttingtan. These
natives live as their ancient anv
cesters did. wringing an existence
out of the bushland by farming
and small-scale livestock or poul-
try growing. Because of the ani-
mals’ propensity for contracting
lethal tropical diseases, there is
an astonishing dearth of Wild
game in the Liberian interior. The
natives supplement what little
fowl and fish meal is available
by raising ducks, goats, and
chickens in their villages.

Most of the primitive tribes
hava members who have never
seen the white man, but have only
heard stories. The general tribal
image is of a “kind of superman
with all kinds of magic,” Baay
says

The tribal native has no concept
of the world as it exists; even
those who have seen maps or II‘
lasu are unable to accept a hori-
mn which stretches beyond the
coast or further than Monrovia.
There are villages in thl deep
bush still to be reached; than is
a job in Liberia that is gargantuan
in scope.

Buy believes that many of the
native customs, such as closeness
of family and tribal ties, an ones
which could be better employed
by our more civilized cultures.
Needless to say, there are endless
benefits which modern methods
could bring to the natives. Theirs
is a whole story in itself as they
continue to live, simply and primi«
tive, in contrast to the broadening
horizon of modern inﬂuence in Li-
beria, West Africa.

Dunforill Spends Seven Months in Paris
Under Universal Science Foundation

By Pam Clay

From July until the end of
January, Joseph Danforth
(chemistry): his wife, and his
four children lived in Paris,
where Danforth was working
with the UNESCO Science
Teaching Section.

Danforth actually had two re-
sponsibilities. Through his pro-
fessional connections he was
able bi) work with UNESCO sec-
tion, the head of which is Albert
Baez (father of Joan Baez). In
this capacity Danforth aided in
the development of films and
teaching aids for UNESCO
teachers to use. “It is difficult
enough to teach chemistry at
Grinnell," said Dsnforiih, “and
hero almost everyone has the
same general backgroun ."

UNESCO has a great prob-
lem with 115 countries all hav-
ing different cultures, religions,
teaching methods, and teaching
aims. ”It strives for the most
worthwhile objchVes in sclen»
tific education but the difficul-
ties of accompiishment are
many," he said.

In many of the Eastern coun-
tries chemistry is necessarily
more practical; in d us t r i ll
chemistry is stressed. The lib
oral arts concept does not exist,
and students are trained mainly
as professional scientists

Daniorth also taught a begin-
ning chemistry laboratory at
the American College, a two-
year liberal arts college in Par-
is. The American College has
students from all over Europe
and several from the Rice Insci<
tuta in the United States its stu-
dents also have quite hetero-
g e n e o u 5 educational back-
grounds

Danforth said that for a fam-
ily of six who did not know
French, living in Paris was
hard and expensive. They lived
at the Pension de Famille (sime
ilar to a boarding house) “The
French cooking was very good
at first but they always had so
much garlic in the meat!" he
exclaimed. “Also, we were not
accustomed to some of their

 

delicacies-such as cow's head,
which is all fat,”

Daniorth explained that Paris
has virtually no suburbs mod
that the population density is
about three times that of New
York City because everyone
lives above the many small
shops.

The French have a much
greater time involvement in

education than do Americans.
They travel to school (some-
times quite a distance), they go
to school for is long time, and
they take many subjects A
large number of them know
two or three languages.

As a difference from the
American situation, Danfotth
cited the definite lack of what
seems to be efficiency accord
ing to the American conception,
it was more difficult to ac-
complish things which Ameri-
can: think should be don. im<
mediateiy. The French are
proud of their own heritage and
are not extremely interested in
allowing or bringing in new
things which are not of French
origin, Danforth noted.

Pioneers Finish Worst Season In Pasl 13 Years ,

The recordrbreaking scoring
of Jeff Frantz provided must of
the bright moments in Grin-
nell’s otherwise drah basketball
season.

Frantz, Grinnell’s “Mr. EVv

two single game point marks.
The e - 2 junior guard - forward
wrote new season point (509)
and field goal (208) standards
along with single game point
(46) and'ﬁeld goal (22) marks.

He's the first Pioneer ever to
top the 500-point plateau in a
single season, John Musser set
the old record of 445 in 195455.

Dave Dunlop chalked up the
other three marks 7177 field
goals in a season, 43 points in a
game, and 18 field goals in a
game—Vin the 194950 and 1950‘

failed to reach double figures
only once in 22 games.

He now has 900 points in two
seasons and is only 203 shy of
the career mark jointly held
by Musser and Jim Mifflin.

Frantz also paced Grinnell
in the rebounding department
with 234. His season high of 30
at Monmouth was only one
short of the school record.

A complete hall player,
Frantz is also a defensive and
floor standout.

Two other Pioneers boasted
scoring averages in double fig-
ures. Elliott Hibbs tallied 286
markers for a 13.0 average and
Tom Hlll was close behind with
273 points and a 12.3 average.

Hibbs had a single game high
of 25; Hill 23.

Clyde Smith was number four

average. Ted Risser ranked
fifth, 15:! markers and a 7.3 av-
erage.

Smith, the only senior regu-
lar, ranked second in rebound-
ing with 136. Hill pulled down
118.

AS a team, the Pioneers were
outshot from the field (739-704)
and from the free throw line
(401-324) and were outrebound-
