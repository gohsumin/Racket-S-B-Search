Grinrlell House, Presidents' Home

(mi-w of two an‘l’cles)
By STEPHEN GROW

Gt'iitnell House, until 1961 the
President's Home, stands state-
ly and gracious on the corner
0! Park Street and Filth Ave-
nue. The house has been inti-
mately connected with Grinnell
tradition Since it was built in
1917, a tradition which some-
how pervades its atmosphere.
it is commonly the scene of
prestigious events —- the recent
Phi Beta Kappa ceremony. an
nccaslonzil concert or recital,
ur the meeting or the Board or
Trustees, This splendid struc-
ture has an interesting past.

The President’s House stands
on property which the College
has owned since 1887. Before it
was built in 1917, at a Cost of

at

titty-six thousand dollars, an-
other house, the Little House,
occupied the property and
sewed as the home or Presi-
dents Gates, Main. and Brad-
ley. The Little House was built
by an early resident oi Grin-
nell, a businessman and mayor,
aiter whom it was named.
Around 1916 the building was
in such bad repair that Presi»
dent Main and his iamily
moved out of the house. The
building was razed and the
present Griiinell house built in
1917.

in a letter to the “Brethren
and Sisters or the Fellowship

lege Foundation stated the rea<

Chambers Visils

Campus; Reports
On Black Power

Ernest Chambers, a black
power speaker ironi Omaha,
Nebraska, visited the campus
last Friday and Saturday to
address both integrated and
black audiences, attend classes,
and counsel individual students
on the meaning 0! black power.
His working definition of the
term, as he explained to a press
conference, is “A well-loaded
gun in the hands or a man who
knows who the enemy is."

The real enemy. Chambers
stressed ilt campus appear-
ances, is the American system,
whose laws, morality, and struc»
ture he heels are all geared to-
ward whites.

During his Italy, Chambers
lived in a mom in East Norris
Hall. His Visit, sponsored by
CBS, the Initiative fund, and
other sources. brought him into
contact with many individual
students and small groups or
students in the Forum, in his
dormitory room, and on the
campus. “1 prefer talking
to black students," he added,
saying there was a need to unity
black college students behind
the ideas of black power, He ad-
dressed several integrated au-
diences, however, and explained
his interpretation of black hiss
wry—as distinct from American
historyeand what he saw as the
need for violent social relorm.

His 8:00 lecture in Roberts
Theatre on “Alternatives loi-
Black and white People” war
delivered to an audience or 600.
Chambers' indictment oi the
Christian religion as inheiently
white and racist was strongly
worded The ”alternative"
Chambers saw was one oi racial
pride by blacks, preceded by a
violent rejection of American
white culture and history.

SGA Leaders See
Leggett Proposal
As Mixed Blessing

Reaction to President Leg-
gett’s proposal tor open dorms
34 hours per week has met with
split opinion trnm student Gov-
ernment. Varying opinions as to
whether the policy should be
accepted and as to how much
the new policy should be en-
iorced occur both among the
SGA leaders and the various
house presidents.

SGA leaders Tom Thomas.
Lee Maril, and Heather Foote
appear split in their opinions
as to what, it anything, should
he done to achieve a more lib-
eral position than Leggett's.
Tom Thomas felt that the pro-
posal contained a “potential tor
coming up with u very work-
able situation,” and at it was
acceptable to a majority or the
students, considering the close—
ness ot the vote in the recent
SGA reterenduni on opens. He
ielt that the major emphasis 01
Student Government Should be
towards the implementation or
the new rule. Thomas said that
“within his (Leggett’s) broad
guidelines, there is an awful
lot that can go either way,"
concerning particulars such as
entorcement and a Student Bill
of Rights and Responsibilities.
Tom Thomas emphasized, how-
ever, that SGA is “up in the
air as far as an ofﬁcial posi-
tion.” and that his position will
vary with student opinion and
the willingness or others to
compromise.

C of HP President Lee Maril
would not comment on his po-
sition, saying that it is his “pol-
icy iiot to have interviews with
the 58:3,” He said that he had
been misquoted by the sun
just atter he became C ot HP
President, and that now, “all
communications (with the Scar-
let and Black) must be writ-
ten." It was learned, however,
that Marti was against accept-

Where the Truth Lies . . .

By DONALD STUMP

Besides committing political suicide by promoting student self-
determination, the student government has done one notable thing
this year: it has struck a blow, untortunately a bit below the
belt. for truth, They have shown as a falsehood the old truism
that it is what one does which really matters, not what he says.
Most oi the thrill of declaring home rule consisted of proclaim-
ing desires, openly announcing the home rule — or rather, unruie
-—Which had existed tie facto for some time, and saying to our-
selves that it is legitimate. I am heartened to see that the Word
is considered so important.

1 can only conclude from President Leggett’s letter to the
Student Affairs Committee that he. too, takes joy in proclaiming
his desires. Unfortunately. his countervrevolution is not as far
along as the Students’ revolution, and his letter contains more in-
domitable hope than realism or practical plans for turning back
the tide oi student power.

Some of his proposals are simply not well reasoned. He asks
for more offrcampils housing both as a means or satisiying the
desires of many students to leave the residence halls and as an
“official response” to misconduct in the dorms. How can giving
culprits something widely desired by students be anything but
an incentive to break the rules? If this is to become the standard
punishment for major violations, the Judicial Council will be
throngeil by gieelul deiendants. To put the cap on the absurdity,
the parenthetical comment that off-campus housing is already at
the “current limit of available rental housing" seems to blast both
proposals. If there is no housing left, how can more students
leave? Should the college build or buy houses? Will the college
not then be responsible for students behavior in them?

Such coniusions are not so important as the crucial prob-
lems with the President's suggestion that the college "create and
maintain enough differences in the regulations of individual halls
so that both present and prospective students of different expecta-
tions and sophistications can be accommodated." the plan is to
have each Student choose a hall with the regulations he Wants to
lollow. It is implicit in the proposal that 1) the administration
ought to cater to slildents' expectations, 2) students know how so
phisticated they are. and 3) they will choose a hall of less sophis-
tication, if they know they are better suited for it. Are these as-
sumptions that an “accountable" college administration ought to
be making?

By trying to fit its halls to the expectations of students, even
those not yet here, the college has made a radical shift in policy,
It used to be assumed that students chose the college because it
suited them, and then accommodated their lives to it. How far
will the president take the principle oi changing the institution to
fit the students? Will he change the curriculum to fit their expec»
rations? How many students would then “expect" the Humanities
or Social Studies requirements? Will the composition of the faculty
and the policy of admissions be based on student desires? If Dr.
Leggett does not come up with a reason why the principle holds
for social rules and not ior academic policies, the facility ought to
lsk for his head; and the Students will probably give it to them.

On the sophistication of students, an old question must be
asked: How does one know when he does not know? Most Students
have touted homenile as a means of learning what is necessary to
get along with other people. The plan of having options assumes
that Students Will already know what rules are necessary for their
happiness. Tile only consistent plan would be to let students make
up their rules as they learn which ones they preier by hard expe~
rience. Furthermore, how many students would suffer the igno-
minity or choosing less liberty than others have?

If the President's plan for various options does not in practice
boil down to having Freshman dom'ls and all the oll‘iers unre~
stricted as the college will allow, 1 will be pleasantly surprised

in all these arguments, l have taken the letter more seriously
than I think most students wtll bother to do. If students pursue
their passion to eliminate Contradictions between their words and
deeds, they thI act according to what they have said in declar~
ing home-rule and voting tor the option of 24-hour visitations. Why
should they listen to the president when they have already pro<
claimed he has no legitimate say in making their rules? He does
not threaten them with proctor power; and he offers no better
reasons to knuckle under than the assertion that “it is necessary
now to admit we need to achieve a better balance than we have
between the . . . interests of students, faculty and College Adminr
istralion ' it will be an act of grace if the students now cheerily
contradict everything they decided during the past ueeks while
those ln Burling basement looked on in silence. Most students will
not be able to stomach such concessmns as well as Schneii‘ov. Dr.
Leggett has, i fear, multed his best chance to repent ioi havmg
allowed students to ilout college rules.

Now, although the administration has given no reason for stu-
dents to retilm to the fold, either in the form oi coersion or per»
suasion, i think that accepting the President's proposal on “opens”
is the most reasonable course students can take. I share his hope
that they will act in contradiction to what they have said about
selfdetermlnation and visitation hours. it is more important in the
recent crisis to make one’s actions true to the nature of the col-
lege than true to past declarations. The old lie about deeds being
the things that count turns out to be true in this situation.

What will those who think that this column is simply an ex-
pression of archaic absolutisrn say about that? i not only admit
that an old truth lies, but the same old lie is true. The truth al»
ways lies in equivocations.

1 Les Danseurs Africairls: Vulgar I

By PAUL ROTHMAN

Les Danseurs Afl‘lcalns,
shown twice Saturday night,
was the most grossly overrat—
ed production Grinnell has
presented this year. Although
the production was somewhat
enjoyable, many of its ideas
and methods verged on a med-
iocrity which forced the use of
vulgar, nonpmfessional stage
techniques. The initial act,
‘L'Oiseau Sarce,‘ set a pattem
of plays which was main-
tained throughout.

Choreography was true and
lifeless because it consisted
almost entirely of a repeating
series of simple claps and
turns, foot stomping, and hip
swiveling. The eliorts oi the
dancers were often half-heart-
ed and the movements of the
dancers were not coordinated
with one another. The ”Broth-
ers’ ” cheerleaders did as well,
it not better. The large num-
ber of dancers on the stage
doing sever-a1 diiierent things
proved that strength lies more
in numbers than in the adroib
ness or any of its members.
“Les Acrobats.” however, need-
ed no camouflage, and each one
was quite spectacular.

The accoutrements were
most exquisite but should
have been used to accent the
agility of the Danseurs rather
titan to disguise their clumsi-
ness. Specifically, in “La Super-
Dame Dogon Masque” the
masks and costumes could have
been far more effectively dis—
played with an intricate dance.

The ineptitude was not only
shown by the dancers. The mu-
Slc was often lifeless. Its rare
praiseworthy moments cannot
be attributed to the vtriilosity
of any one musician but rath-

er to the effect of the iner-
twining primitive beats of
many individuals.

The artistic use of bare
breasts was indeed beautiful
and gratifying but, I fear, its
use was for the salacious ex-
ploiiation of desires harbored
in a temperate but pusillani-
mous male audience. These
brandished busts were a
means of “selling" the show.

My main objection to Le:
Danseurs Africans was that
the performers were used
merely as props. They should
have been the show rather
than a part of an extravaganza.

The atmosphere of the per-
formance was one of abject aha
sequloilsness. The dancers do
not use the emotional ges~
lures their roles call for, but
cater to the Uncle Tom dispo-
sition that white, middle~class
audiences love to see. In "The
Funeral Ceremonies of the
Dogons." the men play with
their guns as ii they were toys
instead oi assuming the vi-
ClOiiS temperament of savage
hunters. A work with the po—
tential of becoming highly
emotional while culminating
on the theme or the unnervtng
unknown dissipates wtth the
foolish antics of these Mali
Davy Crocketts. It is almost
as if they are saying, “Black
Power? not us. We are all
good black folks."

This pi-etentiousness was not
only displayed by the danc-
ers, it was even more evident
in the fact that the guilty
white audience refused to see
any laults in the doings of
black men even when the
shortcomings were as obvious
as they were in Les Danseuts
AfricainS.

backward to the “hypocrisy" oi
the system before the SGA refer-
endum.

AWS Board President heathr
er Foote Said that she saw "no
point in arguing whether you

She said that she would “ac-
cept it as a temporary meas-

it appeared that the large
majority oi house presidents
were willing to go along wuh
President Leggelt’s proposal.
The main concern of both men
and women house presidents,
however. was over enforce-
ment at the rule. Many house
presidents were concerned with
what kind of enforcement would
be required, whether they
would be required to eniorce
the rule, and whether enforce-
ment would really be possible.

play to your friends?

A. Yes.

Q. (Guess that wasn’t such a
provocative question.) What did
you think of the airplane crash
in the beginning?

A. i thought he was a reck-
less driver.

Yeah, he shoulda been more
careiul. He could have dented
a wall or something. like when
Moni humped into the garage.

Q. If you were the flower,
would you have iallen in love
with the little prince?

A. I thought he was too silly.

Q. What did you think or the

resented the dramatic moment
of the play?

A. (Silence)

Q. Uni. what scene did you
like best?

A. I liked the reckless driver
on the trike.

Q. Would you have bought
those iancy pills he was sell-
ing. Remember, with one at

out water for a week?

A. No. You would need water
to swallow the pill.

i don’t think it would get
stuck in your throat.

I liked the drunk man.

light.

And it should of had a mud-
ball light.

Q. Did the prince remind you
of anyone?

A. He reminded me of my
gym teacher. The hair was the
same.

The flower reminded me of
my cousin.

(At this point. stirred by our
probing reporters’ questions,
the children began to talk with-
out questions being asked. Der
spire the fury of the debate, our
stenographeis were able to re-
cord Lhe following remarks.)

I’m hungry, all i had tor
lunch was a toasrcm pop-up.

I thought the tort was the
prettiest. I thought you don’t
like girls. i hate girls. She was
an animal, not a girl, so it
doesn’t count. (Finally our
harried reporters were able to
return to their questioning.)

Q. Did you like the play?

A. It was the best play I ever
saw. it was the only play you
ever saw. It was the goodest
play i say.

didn't order [he sun to set when
the prince asked him?

A. Because it wasn't time.
No, I think he just wanted the

snake. Why do you think he
was there?

A. I don’t know,

Q. Do you think the prince
learned anything in his travels?

A, He learned that the flower

for it.

on account of both the variety
and the sheer quantity or the
work loads they have untlertak.
en. The only reason i can see
that these three were over-
looked is because of the “inde~
spensible" nature of the ser-
vices they are now perlorming,
In which case they should be

At any rate. the criterion oi

ignored by Saga Chuck and Karl
Southworth in their collabora-

I request that they reconsider
their decision in the light 01
these two factors, and also that
the Senate committee investi-
gating Saga look into this mat-

Leiler Bids Students

Be Strong in Courage

To the Editor:

1 wish to speak to all those
students who may ieel disap-
pointed, unrepresented. or
possibly lust angry about the
events of the past iew weeks
on this campus. Grinnell Col-
legs is not one of the more
liberal places on earth. It you
are opposed to the recent so-
cial changes, do not think or
yourselt as reactionary simply
because you are so inioimed.
If you still have a sneaking
suspicion that morality is im-
portant don't let some nincom-
poop talk you out oi it; all
significant human activity in~
Volves moral decisions. It
others have told you that per-
sonal behavior is of no con-
cern to the community. l'e-
member that the community
is merely a peculiar collec-
tion oi persons.

You may have already dis-
covered the fact that Grinneil
is a very unusual place.
There are very iew radicals
here! Most people seem to be‘
lieve what they believe be~
cause others believe it. They
could not believe it by themv
selves. Unfortunately, people
who may share your behets
seldom have the desire to ex-
press themselves. it is harder
to speak with reason than with
passion, and the applause is
noticeably less.

Finally, it you don't
what’s happening say
thing. It is your right
responsibility. But say what»
ever you must say without
hostility, disrespect. and mal-
ice. Do not make yoni-selt vul—
nemble to Character assassi-
nation. Arguments nil honii-
nem abound on this campus.
Say what you believe because
you really believe It. not be-
cause your peers say that they
believe it. You may iind your-
self with more company man
you had imagined. No society
has to be controlled by [Ilosa
who yell the loudest and say
the least.

Blades Tie Graceland 3-3
In Remalth After 3-1 Loss

Grinnell's Blades iought
Graceland College to a 3-3 tie
in last Sunday's rematch at
the Ice Arena in Des Moines

The improvement at the
Griiinell squad literally
stunned Graceland, who had
handed the Blades a at de-
teat only a week earlier. 0ue
unhellevlng Graceland player
inquired as to whether the
Blades had picked up some

layers trom Des Moines or
owa State.

Coach - captain Mike Schat—
(er said the team had im-

roved in every department,
'The deiense was real good,”
he noted. “We had lots or hus-
tle, but our biggest improve
ment was passing. I’ve never
seen us pass so well before."

The Blades, playing with on-
iy a 1»man bench during the
(irst hall of the game (the car
aarrynig the other players
had a ﬂat tire on the way in),
rabhed a commanding 270
ear],

The lirst goal was a do tout
unassisted shot by lettwiug
Bruce Graham which came in
the iii-st period.

B rian McPhrtland, the
Blades’ right deienseman.
neared the second goal on a
to loot slap shot to give Grin—
hell a 2-0 lead.

Graceland came back
strong in the second period to

knot the score at 272. With less
than live minutes gone in tho
tinal period they tnolr a 3-2
advantage,

The Blades regrouped their
forces and tied the score when
Grant Crandall centered to
Tim Power who slapped in a
10 foot shot. lll spite o! a con-
tinued surge on the Graceland
goal in the ilnal minutes, the
Blades were not able to pull
out a Victory.

The game was characterized
by roughness and superb do
tensive play. Ken Sigei, the
Blades' line goalie, made 22
saves. One of the highlights of
the contest was a l-onel con-
froiitation ln which Ken came
15 feet out of the goal area to
make a save.

Dther standouts on defense
were Pete Strouse, Terry Par—
sinen and Jeff “Boom Boom"
Mlllikin. Coach Schaliet‘ said
that it was the best game he's
seen Boom Boom play thus
far,

Graceland was landed with
5 penalties during the game.
Several times the uncalled—(or
roughness turned into near
brawls.

on offense Tom “Rocket"
Jackson, Bluce Graham, Til-n
Power and Grant Crandall
played especially tine games.

The Blades take to the ice
Sunday tor their next game.

GRAY MATTER!

By BILL GRAY
I noted with mixed emotions the coming or the inevitable ex-

pansion of coeducational hours. They have little effect on me since
the last girl i had in my room had merely stopped by to ask di-
rections to the Forum. Once again it appears that it will he the
I. M. program which will hear the brunt at the changing or cam-
pus lite. it used to he that I. M.’s were so popular and contested
so liercely because the male populace had little else to release
their pentrup emotions. with FA hours or opens, however, it is
nouhtlul ii there will be enough pent-up anyihing among the men
to have even one good 4"-man Squamish match in fact, I don’t
believe that it would be out oi line to propose separate living quar-
ters tor those people who wish to retain their energy ior use in
athletic endeavors; we could Call their dorm "The Penthouse"

I see where there is going to be co-ed pillgrpong In the North
Lounge. Last year they had cored badminton; it was won by
two men from Smith.

l. M. volleyball is over and, it anyone is interested, 1 Will
publish the standings next week. Charlie Brown once said, "Win-
ning isn't everything, but losing isn’t anything." This is totally
extraneous, but then so is the whole article, so I guess it follows
the pattern of the article and thus isn't extraneousl? Which re<
minds me of someone who once told me that my Whole life was
nothing more than a monumental syllogistic haw.

Yes! It's True!

proposal, there were two
issues to he resolved with re-
spect to open dorms. First.
there was the question oi what
will be done tor the rest oi this
year, and now, a proposal
{or a permanent solution. Un-
tortunately, the talks have been
hitting snares along the way.
Recent discussion has been de-
VDted t0 the real status and
importance of the committee.
Members telt that they had
been bypassed by the students
by recent declaration or home
rule in many dorms, and that

they have been legally bypassed
by the President.

Progress seems slow because
of the many peripheral ques-
tions which must he answered,
because of the number oi pro-
posals made to the committee
by students and faculty to be
considered, and because of the
small amount of time which
may he devoted to these prob-
lems, Limited to one hour a
Week, discussions are not al‘
lowed to develop to such an ex-
tent that much can be accomp
llshed: Mrs Pollak freely admite
ted that little has been accomp
lished in the last few sessions.

Why do they not have more
meetings? The answer is the
limited amount of time mem<
hers can give to their task. The
student members, each thu
head at an important student
organization. have responsibil-
ities for numerous other tasks
which prevent them from de-
voting greater attention to
problems of the committee.
Faculty members also feel bur-
dened by other responsibilities.

A committee as important as
this one, a liaison between Stu-
dents, iaculty, and the Presi-
dent, with power over decisions
in which students have a vital
interest, should be able to act
more quickly and with less
Confusion than this one has.
Possibly the students on the
committee should not be indi<
Viduals who have so little tims
to spend working with it. Also,
because the interest groups in«
valved can and do bypass the
procedures of the committeeI
its decisions seem to have
limited authority. Perhaps if
the workings oi the Student Ai-
iairs Committee were stream-
lined, iuture problems would be
entrusted to its care.
