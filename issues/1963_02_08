What is wrong with Grinnell?’

By Richard Ohlemeyer
5&3 Staff Writer

When Stephen Wood, clean or

of House Presidents why things
are dull at Grinnell, he touched
off a discussion that might
have been called “What is

' Wrong with Grinnell?"

One suggestion was that in-1

may have culled easy going
persons li-om among Grinnell
students. In short Grinnell has
lost its “lags."

An opposite idea was the
thought that living has become
too easy and that since the
only struggle we race is the
unpleasant task oi periodically
attending classes, there is not
enough challenge to the stu-
dent.

General student apathy was

such as women’s hours and the

issues besides the college rules,
he was reminded that college
rules are usually closer to stu-
ldents than most occurrences in
the outside world. »

Another suggestion was that a
lack of strict enforcement of the
rules has deprived the students
of something to gripe about.
Just prior to the discussion
about what is wrong with Grin-

Grinnell A. F. (after Fordl

"By now, most of the anguished outcl'ies arising from
President Bowen’s November pronouncement that there
will be no rule changes this year have died down. Perhaps
with the subsiding of passions we can better see what the
lasting effect of that decision will be.

In reality its real importance is not that we won’t
have liberalization of the drinking rule or women’s hours
this year, nor that the decision was made by administrative
fiat even before the students could present specific pro~
posals; but that the decision was made on the basis of its
effect on the public, not on the merits of the proposals
themselves

This concern for Grinnell‘s image seems to be a pro-
duct 01) the Ford Foundation fund-raising drive. And it‘
seems to many of us that if this is the effect the Ford
grant will have on Grinnell, the college can just as Well do
without the money. ‘

Before the Ford drive began, it was thought that one
of the aims of the college was to provide an atmosphere of
intellectual freedom, where a student could pursue anyl
idea to its logical conclusion, no matter how unpopularl
that idea might be with the public. i

But now the students are prevented from pursuing the‘
idea of li eralization of rules to the logical end of present-
ing specific proposals, because the administration fears
that it will discourage the public from contributing to the
college’s fund drive.

Before the possibility of a Ford grant was considered,
Grinnell distinguished itself from most of the colleges in
the country by its attitude toward intellectual freedom. It
ditﬁfered from those colleges that frown upon religious un-
orthodoxy; it differed from colleges like Beloit which re—
cently refused to let Gus Hall speak on its campus be-
cause of his political views. However, the present concern
for Grinnell’s image, if continued, would eventually extend
to control over the speakers we invite to this campus and

is one who takes pleasure in a virtuous life, a
sinful man one who takes pleasure in a sinful
life. That’s very terse, absolutely correct, and it
has a lot of implications.

sible to lead a virtuous life and still be a very
sinful man (sinful means nasty and greedy, if
you insist I define my terms.) I don’t think I
need to elaborate much on this. because we all
know nasty and greedy men who lead virtuous
lives. The point is simply that their virtue isn’t
worth a fig, because rather than taking pleasure
in virtue itself, they take pleasure in the things
it can bring them; their goodness is not a joy but
a burden, undertaken for the sake of its profit-
able results.

nice, and generous) And this is possible because

To the Editor:

If anything was clear in the

llives through, and then, having
survived, one relaxes and rath-

its appearance in the “lack of

sion reﬂect a deeper and more
limportant attitude on the part of

vague one, that a degree from

Not only do some students fail
to respond “enthusiastically" to
an interim session for “inde-
pendent study," but some fail to
respond in that manner to any
study. Witness the English stu-
dents making only feeble at-
tempts in science, and the sci-
ence students doing likewise in
literature. As if this were not
lenough, consider the students in
their own majors, who do not
really care to ﬁnd out much
more than is necessary for their
classes! This is indicative not
only of a “lack of enthusiasm"

but of no real concept of what
a student is. This is certainly
not a characteristic of the intel-

even come to school?

This whole attitude toward
study shows a false concept of
education, for study becomes the
means by which one acquires a
grade, and the grade is lhe

so forth up the ladder of “suc-

over the ideas we discuss here because they may alienate
those who donate to the college. When that happens, Grin~
nell College will probably be rich, but certainly not dis-
tinguished.

Let’s abandon the policy that has arisen since then
of tlying to stifle discussion of embarrassing ideas in or-
der to protect the college’s reputation. Let’s return to the
goal of intellectual freedom, return to the goal of becoming,
one of the great intellectual institutions of the country, a
goal which the Ford Foundation, in 1961 at least, thought‘
we had the potential to achieve.

The repayable scholarship rule is not old and ready to

or later. This rule is morally wrong. Grinnell College did not
institute its scholarship program to force dissatisfied in-

They probably instituted this rule because it considers,
scholarship students as investments. This rule then violates l

Cagers to [lost Siwasll, Scots

By John Moore
5&3 Staff Writer

Grinnell’s basketball team will
entertain Knox and Monmouth
this weekend on the home court,
following a road trip which all
but eliminated any hope of the
Pioneers repeating as Confer-
ence champions.

Last Friday night the Pioneers
dropped a 70-68 decision to lea—
gue leading Ripon after a hip
and tuck battle. The next day
Grinnell was defeated by Law—
rence, the team they had beaten
by 25 a week before, by the score
of 73—70. The vikings scored six
free throws in the last 44 sec—
onds to cap a come-fromabehind
victory.

Jim Miftlin, however, did suc—
ceed ln piling up 81 points in
three games to move into fourth
place in the individual scoring
race with a 20.5 average.

It appears that a balanced
scoring attack with respectable
free throw shooting will be the
key to this Weekend’s games. If
the Pioneers can find this bal-
ance, the Siwash and the Scots

Swimmers sink Knox 56-36

By 1. Eric Jacobson
5&3 Sfaﬁ Writer

in the first Conference duel
of the season the Grinnell
swimming team defeated Knox
56-36 at the Grinnell pool Feb.

The tankers will continue
their conference action today at
4:30 pm. against Beloit and to-
morrow at 10 am. against Law.
rence.

In only two events did a
Knox swimmer finish ahead of
a Pioneer. Grinnell got 9 out
of 11 firsts.

RALPH PRAY set a new
Grinnell and pool record in the
500 freestyle in a time of 6105.2.
He also swam freestyle legs of
the winning 40!) yard medley
and 400 yard freestyle relays.

Jim Adelrnan won the zoo
butterfly and Jim Cross the zoo
backstroke. They both swam on
the two winning relays,

John Teget and Howard
Schein, who swam in their
ﬁrst meet this year, swept the
shorter freestyle events. Teget
won the 60 and mo and Schein

was second in the loo and I

won the zoo. In addition Te-
get was a member of the
freestyle relay and Schein
was third in the 500.

The sixth member of Grin—
nell’s team, Palmer Haiti, won
the zoo yard breaststroke, was
second in the 160
medley and was a member of
the medley relay

COACH mv SIMONE called
the /win' “an indication of good
spirit and morale." He feels that
the team is beginning to get

into shape, but that a lot more]

work will be needed before the
conference meet,

The Pioneers will get a good
look at some of the conference
strength this weekend as they

could have a long ride home.
And with six consecutive home
games, the Pioneers might still
end the season with a respect.
able wm-ioss percentage .

Neither Knox nor Monmouth
can boast a winning record but
they could easily surprise a ﬂow
teams in their remaining seven
games.

The siwash, holding a five-
wln, six-loss record, will be
headed by Otis Cowan, who is
averaging a nifty 17.7 points a
game. standing only 5’ 10",
Cowan is an amazing jumper
and can run and shoot. Flanking
Cowon will be a pair of rapidly
improving sophomores, Jim Jepa
son and Ed Havens, who will
handle the rebounding chores.

Lack of height will definitely
hurt the Siwash. Not a man on
the squad stands over 641, and
unless they are able to get posi-
tion on rebounds, the Pioneers
should control both boards.

In their first encounter at
Galesburg, Knox took a close

loit has lost only to the confer-
ence power Carleton. Lawrence
has lost only to Beloit and
Carleton.

Beloit has a very strong free—
lstyle team with Bill Boyd, a
lteam co~capizin, Bob Godfrey
and Bill Putnam, who was last
year’s freshman champion in thel
so and loo yard freestyle.

Beloit also has John Vanl

points respectively, while Cowan
pumped in 19 points and Jepson
18 points for Knox.

On Saturday, the winless Scots
invade Darby Gym. Missing on
this years squad is Jeri-y Mell,
who was the kcy to the Scots
second place finish last year.
However, the playmakcr of last
year’s squad, Terry Wilkison,
has adequately taken over Mcll's
scoring role and is currently
averaging 19.1 points a game,

The Scots boast a team with
a lot of height. The squad
avearges o3 which would indi-
cate a lot of strength under the‘
boards. This rehbunding strength
is centered around two big
iuniors, Al Carius at 6’ 5" and
Harold Rathgeb at 6’6". Carin:
and hathgeb can also be count-
ed on to score in double figures.

Grinnell took a close one from
the Scots. 55.33, at Monmouth
early in January. Mifﬂin, Sun-
dell, Denny Asby and Gar Smith
all scored in double ﬁgures.
Wilkison scored 19 points for
the Scots but didn’t get the
usual support from Carius, who

scored only seven points. l

Slyke who holds 6 pool ree—
ords at Bell) Van Slyke can
and may swim any event but
will probably swim the indi-
vidual medley and zoo yard
butterfly.

LAWRENCE has a more bal-
anced squad with standouts
Pete Betzer and Larry Dick-I
man in the backstroke, Dickl
Snyder in the breaststroke and
Mike Hartong and Chris Vogel
in freestyle events.

 

A threeplatooned high scur~

“In appreciating a picture in

a hundred paintings upstairs for

Then a process of “musical pic-
