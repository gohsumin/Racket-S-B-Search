SCHNEIROV CASE DEADLOCKS COUNCIL;
LEGGETT SENTENCE IS CONDUCT PROBATION

Students, Faculty
Split on Penalty

On Wednesday, October 23,
the Judicial Council delivered
to President Glenn Leggett its
decision that Richard Schneirov
is guilty of the charge of hav-
ing violated the college’s rule
on visitation by members of the
opposite sex, The court, how-
ever, was unable to agree upon
a recommendation regarding
action to be taken. It then he-
oame the duty of President Leg«

ment or pardon Im‘ the violin

The court decision was handed
to Sehneirtw when the members
of the court leit the President’s
office.

The court ruled that ‘other
persons concerned with the
case acted inappropriately. In
its statement the court repri<

because he did not register
Schneirov's guest with the resi-
dent adviser in accordance with
rule in the handbook (p. 17).
The Student Senate was repri.

of Students, 5. Eugene Thomp<

A Scarlet and Black survey

great majority of the students
who responded (130 in all) had
participated in “illegal visita-

Ordered To Quit

Quad Saga Workers Plan Sa’rurclay S’rrike Dorm by Nov. ll

Student employees of Saga at the Quad are
planning to strike beginning Saturday morning
ll certain demands are not met. In a two-and—one
hall hour meeting on Wednesday afternoon a stue
dent committee presented the students‘ demands
to the administration and to Saga. No sufficient
agreement was reached. The two parties will meet
again Friday afternoon.

on Tuesday the students made the following
three demands: 1. “That all Saga workers receive
at the very least a live cent increment to any
existing base pay alter both the second and ﬁlth
semesters of working tor Saga. 2. That block times
be Split at the discretion of the mealhead (a stu-
dent) among the members oi his crew who sus-
tain an extra load of work should any member or
the crew be signiiicantly late or be absent. a. That
block times be revised immediately to the mutual
Satisfaction of the workers and the management.”

“Block times” refers to one or Saga’s policies.
Each job has been timed and found to take a cer-
tain average amount of time when done satisiac-
torily. it is lor this average amount of time that
a worker is paid when he does a certain job, re-
gardless oi how long it actually takes. According
to Chuck Hand, director of the Food Service, this
helps to maintain a certain level of elllciency.

it is presently Saga’s policy not to pay any ere
tra money to workers who must cover the job or
an absent or late worker. According to Saga Chuck
the meaihead has among his duties making sure

that every job ls covered during a certain shiitr
ii a worker does not appear it is the mealhead's
responsibility to cover the job. His other duties
include filling the milk machine and seeing that
everyone is properly seated However. it two or
more workers tail to appear, Saga does not pay
anyone extra. John Shaw, headwaiter at the Quad
and one of the negotiators for the Students, said
that such absences are “comparatively rare.” One
of the meaiheads at the Quad began splitting
blocks last year without official authorization.

“Neither the College nor Saga would be happy
about a students not being paid tor doing a job,"
stated Ralph Pomerenk, Assistant Business Main
ager of Grinnell College. However, Pomerenk is
presently opposed to changing the policy regard
ing block times, “if you start splitting blocks, you
remove the incentive for the mealheads' having
everyone there," he said.

Would the college save money it a student
had to cover a second job? “I suppose less money
would be paid," stated Pomerenkt

The second major difference concerns the
second and iilth semester increment. Presently
Saga workers are the only ones getting any incre-
ment, live cents alter the second semester. The
present base pay is $1.15 an hour. This wage rate
is standard around campus. Any wage increase ior

At a general housemeeling on
Monday, October 21, Loose Hall
decided to establish a policy or
“self-determination.” It thus be-
came the third dormitory, lol-
lowing the examples of Langan
and Smith, to adopt “home
rule."

Of the 95 men living in Loose
so came to the meeting. The
vote was 44 for sell—deten-nina-
tion, 32 for the present system
of “discretion,” and l for the
continuation of the ofﬁcial pol-
icy of 275 pm on Sunday after-
nouns for open visitation. There
were 12 abstentions.

Following the meeting, floor
meetings were held to establish
rloor policies.

The general housemeeting be-
gan with so minutes of debate.
The debate focused on argu-
ments both for and against
home rule that had been de
veioped in several weeks of dis-
cussion, and in a twrrhour de-
bate which had. been held the
previous week. Opposition to
home rule centered mainly
around the rights or the minor-
ity, alumni sentiment, and the
financial problems that might
arise for the college if the
halls lollowed a policy of self-
determination.

Grant Crandall, ’69, president
of Loose Hall, explained his
idea of how “home rule” would
work. He said that the hall had
decided to allow each ﬂoor to
determine its own policy on the
matter of visiting hours. Ha
stressed that minorities, even
very small ones, shared in the
making of decisions.

Crandall, a firm advocate of
hail sellrdetermination, stated
that he understood that the en4
tire hall would not be prose-
cuted {or the actions of some
of its members.

Sentiment against both the
idea of selirdetermination and
the timing or the declaration
existed alter the meeting was
adjourned. This sentiment im<
mediateiy found its voice in all
open letter, signed by 20 Loose
men, disassocianng the signers
irom the position oi the hall,
Crandall said that most who
signed the letter have now ap.
proved oi the new policy. This
approval came utter Dean 5.
Eugene Thompson said at a
meeting ior student advisers
that no student in the hall would
be prosecuted ior violating the
rules oi the hall unless the stile
dent himsell wanted to take hil
case to the Judicial Council.

Last Wednesday President
Glenn Leggett acted on the Ju-
dicial Council’s "guilty" ver-
dict and sentenced Richard
Schneirov, '70, to conduct pro-
bation and dismissal from his
dormitory or any collegeaowned
residence for the remainder til
the academic year. Schneirov
was given until November 11,
1963 to leave his room.

The president acted one week
after the Judicial Council pre-
sented him with its decision.
The court was deadlocked on
what punishment to prescribe.
The president indicated in his
statement that the court had in-
rormslly asked him to consider
either “no penalty" 0!‘ “conduct
probation" as possible options.

Mr. Leggett said that the case
emphasized “1) the need to
strengthen the procedural meth.
ods and perhaps the organiza«
tion of the Judicial Council, and
2) the need to hasten substan-
tial improvement in the man-
agement of our residence
halls."

in a general statement follow-
ing a statement of the speciiiu
action that would be taken on
the case oi Schneirov, Mr. Leg-
gett noted lour needs oi the
residence halls: “(1) a mode of
living and regulation consistent
with the mental and physical
health of students, one which
will serve the best interests of
the academic program of the
College and so permit students
to work'eriectively as students;
(2) a set or standards for he-
havlor, and enforcement of such
standards, that assure the

Schneirov Case:

By BENSON SMITH

Immediately alter President
Leggett released his decision
concerning the Schnelrov trial,
Richard Schneirov and Bonnie
Tinker met in a room in Bur»
ling basement and prepared a
statement, The statement
charged Leggett with unwilling-
ness and inability to deal with
the fundamental problems of
residential hail iile.

The problems in the residence
system are centered around the
current regulations regarding up-
en dorms. The Student Senate
has referred to the regulation as
unacceptable to the student com-
munity, but has tabled any pro-
posals to change the regulation
until iurthar investigation can
b-mado. .

The Background

At Schneirov’s trial, Lawrence
Frank, chairman of the Judicial
Council, said that the court was
going to review the rule, ior it
the rule was lound to be unjust,
then Schneirov may not have
violated anything. Schneimv ad-
mitted violating the Visitation
rule and said, "The charges are
true but I plead not guilty."
The court subsequently iound
Schneirov guilty or the charge:
as stated but could not agree
on a penalty.

All at the house presldentl
who spoke at the trial said they‘
disagreed with the present rule.

33 Take Cornell’s
Old Sem, Charged,
Put on Suspension

Thirty Cornell College stu-
dents and 3 nonrstudents were
arrested and charged with un-
lawful assembly after a Shout
takeover of the college adminis-
nation building October 17.
Doyle Raglan. spokesman for
the protesters, explained that
the group wished to stir up an
"apathetic” and "racist” oam-
pus.

Cornell Dean Stuart Good told
the 5&3 in a telephone inter-
view that when the administra-
tion expressed its intent to re
gain control of the administra-
tion building, the students pre-
lented a list of 4 demands and
Itipulated that they be met with-
h 48 hours. The demands were:
”The establishment of a Black
activity center which would
house a library, assembly-lec-
ture hall, and a social center.
I) That at least 10 per cent of
the convocation he presented by
Black entertainers and speak-
ers,

8) That the curriculum Include
courses in Black art, literature,
history, and others dealing with
the Afro-American and African
culture.

4) The college should step up the
hiring of Black instructors, with
the addition of at least one
Black adviser to the staff. A
ﬁfth demand later made was
that no charges be brought
against the pmtestors.

Raglan demanded that Presi-
‘dent Samuel Stumpt sign a
Atatement delineating the five
demands, and that he insure
that these demands would be
implemented within the forty-
eight hours. Stumpf felt he did
not have the authority to sign
auch a statement and that the
goals could not be accomplished
in such a short period of lime.
Threats by nonsprotesting stu-
dents to forcibly eject the pro-
testers iorced Stumpt to call in
the Linn County police

The Students, after talking for
five minutes with college offi~
cials, were led out of the build
ing by Raglon. At the police
station the students were re-
leased on “their own recog-
nizance” and the three nonsstu-
dents on $75 bond each.

“I feel a college should handle
internal problems with internal
forces, but if the sources aren’t
available, others must be used.
You can’t put out a fire with
the drinking glasses we have
here at Cornell,“ stated Stump!.

The following official slate-
ment was released the same
day. “The faculty or Cornell
College has voted to suspend
without prejudice the students
who were in the administration
building pending judicial deter-
mination of their cases by Car—
nell College.”

Each student will receive a
separate trial and, although
several cases have already been
concluded, no decision on puns
ishment will be announced until
all 39 cases have been heard by
the studentfaculut board.

Read Hall Suffer:
5100 Fire Damage

Last Sunday there was a
fire in the room of Edwin
DeEus, which caused an es-
timated $100 damage to col-
lege property. The fire was
discovered by Michael Bran-
don, ’70, who used a fire ex—
tinguisher to put out the
three foot flames.

A p ollce officer, the
watchman. and Assistant
Dean of Students W. Douglas
Ensminger came to inspect
the scene of the file which
occurred in Read 555. Ac
cording to DeBus the fire
started from the open flame
of a scented candle that was
left burning on the desk
when he left the room.

In addition to the desk that
was destroyed and the dam-
age to the wall and ceiling
by root, DeBus himselt lost
a clock radio and 30 books.
At a Monday meeting the
housekeeping service decided
that the college will not re-
quire bonus to pay for the
damage to college property
caused by the fire.

Arringion Visits
As PPPE Guest;
Supports Nixon

Republican majority Ieadei‘
and president pro tempore of
the llliliois Senate. William Rus-
sell Arrington, served as Poli-
ticiansin-residelnce during his
daylong stay here Wednesday,
October 30. Arrington had
breakfast with Students, toured
the campus, visited three class—
rooms, held an interview with
students that was taped for
KDIC, and attended a bull ses-
sion in the evening.

Arrington. currently serving
as Lieutenant Governor of Illi—
nois, is not only active in Illi-
nois politics, but also in busi-
nes and civic groups.

During an interview, Arring-
ton attacked critics of Richard
Nixon who say that Nixon has
been vague and that he is ovoid-
fng the real Issues of the cam-
paign, Arrington laid that Nixon
has given his statement or the
issuer and taken a definite stand
on those issues. He asserted that
Nixon has stated in great detail
What his Views are.

Arrington went on to say that
he believes Vietnam is not the
major issue of this election, and
that Nixon has not spoken on
this problem only I) e c at us 9
there is a chance that the Pam
peace talks may be successful.
Mr. Nixon does not want to jeo-
pardize the position of the us.
by opposing President Johnson
on this point.

Arrillgton does not know what
effect George Wallace Will have
on the Presidential race, and
does not think that either the
Republicans or the Democrats
will know until after the elec-
tions. He did say, however, that
he does not believe that Wallace
will do as well in the election in
the polls presently predict.

Arrington commented on the
Daley political machine in one
classroom as “Up until this
time, the most efficient machine
in the country." He believes,
however, that a Republican vic-
tory in the races for State's At-
iomey and Governor would
severely damage the effective
ness of the machine. He later
said that Daley controls the pre-
sent Governor of illinois. Sam-
uel Shapiro, as well as many
city orliciais.

Almost onevhalf of the students
having IV's. 47%, said their [V’s
were for “sexual purposes”.
The remaining 53%, those who

did not have lV's for sexual
purposes, had their IV’s general-
ly for the purpose of “talking".

ply “socializing“.

Ninety-five per cent of the re
lponding students said that they
were aware of regular or occa-
sional IV's on their floor, and of
these, only 17% said that they
were bothered by these lV’s.

0f the 75% respondents who
have had illegal visitationl, less
than half, 47%, have made use
of Sunday’s open house. A large
number of students who have
not had IV'e. about 40%, have
used the Sunday “legal" hours.

Ten per cent of all respond~
ants either thought there
should be no change in the
rules, or that they should
be made more strict. One
girl etu dent thought that
there should be "no open
dorms at any timel" Generally,
though, or the 90% who favored
“less strict” rules, most wanted
hours extended, especially on
Friday, Saturday and Sunday
nights, but none expressly fav-
ored 24 hour opens.

One que a tion, concerning
whether rules should be made
standard tor dormitories. floors
of halls, or the entire campus

produced widely spilt opinion.
The question and response to
it is as follows:

There he a standard rule for,
each, . . t .

dormitory .. . 26%
floor . 39%
for the entire campus , 35%

Quite a few people thought
that there was no way to show
that they favored a very flexible
campuswide rule, which would
allow the hall or floor to esta-
blish its own specific hours.
Thus the sentiment ﬁll” this kind
of rule, which was considerable,
was not reflected in the above
question.

Additional comments on the
open dorms question had several
common themes. Although only
14% or the students considered
the question of open dorm:
"not important” to the college,
(many) 38.93% of those writing
additional comments thought
that the emphasis on open
dorms was out of proportion and
in the words of one woman stir.
dent, “There are more impor\-
tant things in this old world,’h

Another common theme that
was apparent throughout the
surveys was a desire to see
whatever new rules were made
be “strictly enforced."

A large number of dtudents’
comments were simply that the
administration had no real right
to determine or limit coedtlcas
tional use of dormitory rooms,
in the words of one student,
"Freedom of visitation should
be accepted as natural”.

One final comment, typical of
many students feelings, should
be mentioned: One male sophoc
more said, “I think there should
be one major rule concernin
open dorms and that is one o,
consideration—that is, I don't
want my right to walk naked to
the shower infringed upon."

grading system there. A poll
was passed out among the stu-
dents asking their opinions on
the aspects oi the grading plan.
The study is not yet complete,
so lull results are not yet avail-
able.

Hastings

A new program 0! freshman
advisors has been instituted at
Hastings. The college feels that
the first semester in college is
the most important time [or a
student. Many teachers are par—
ticipating in the program, and
the freshman think It is Success—
ful.

Knox

The student senate at Knox
has been considering the desir-
ability of the presence or
AFROTC on campus. The first
report was submitted and re-
Ieased two weeks ago and stated
that in terms of the definition
or a liberal arts education,
ROTC was a rejection of the
pi'inClples of this type of educa-

tion. A reply shall be released
as soon as it is available.

The students at Knox are in
the midst or questioning the
regulations governing student
conduct. Automobile and dormi-
tory regulations seem to be the
most talked about. Many stu-
dents ieel they are unnecessarily
regulated in their acttvtty. No
definite movement is atom at
the present time.

MacMurray

Students are asking tor joint
meetings with the board at
trustees for the purpose of het-
[er communication with that
governing body. The board re-
cently abolished the manda-
tory chapel attendance regular
tion.

Carleton

The Carleton black student
organization proposed last week
a two part \VDrkrStudy program.
A student under the program
could choose a program modeled
after that Of Antioch. an al-
ternating workstudy system on
a term basis, or one like that
Of Princeton, Where the student
would Work only during the
summer vacation. The Student
could also elect to not partici-
pate at all in the program. The
aim of the plan is threefold: (1)
to make the education more rel-
evant to the changing world, (2)
to increase the proportion oi
minority group students at
Carleton, and (3) to help alle-
viate the burden of tuition now
resting on students.

University of Iowa

In a report that appeared last
week, statistics revealed that
the enrollment of students at U.
of I. increased faster in the last
twelve years than did the num-
ber ot iaculty members. In that
time. the enrollment has ins
creased 100 per cent, while the
iaculty has grown only 40 per
cent. The problem was blamed
upon the diiiiculty in obtain<
ing money from the legislature.

“Fallen cherub, to be weak is miserable”
John Milton, Paradise Lost

The president has made. an ingen-
ious but dangerous decision, for he
has polarized the alternatives for

‘ Richard Schneirov. Schneirov may
now accept the reward of off-campus
housing and yield to the will of a man
he has argued has no jurisdiction in
the case. Or Schneirov can refuse to
acknowledge the legitimacy of the
ruling and refuse to vacate his dorm-
itory, a place he probably does not
want to stay in, and face expulsion.
The president, however, in order to
avoid a massive exodus must now pre-
sent arguments why others who vio-
late the rule should not be allowed off
campus.

In making his decision Mr, Leg-
gett solved only the short-term prob-
lem of what to do with Richard
Schneirov. The president acted weak-
ly in a time that called for strength,
and it seems that he has begun to
yield to the limitless and unthinking
demands of students.

Richard Schneirov ought to have
been expelled. His co-habitation with
a girl for five days in his dormitory
room, and his persistence in this en-
terprise, even after he was warned by
his resident advisor, was a flagrant af-
front to the structure of rules at the
college. Throughout the case he be-
haved with haughtiness, a character-
istic which does not deserve the par-
don of anyone. The president has
helped Schneirov to be an example
for others who wish to try to flout a
rule and destroy the orderliness of
the campus.

The structure of rules at Grinnell
has broken down. As an example, it
has been the common practice for
those who run for hall president to
list as a qualification for this execu-
tive office a reluctance to enforce the
college rules. Furthermore, dormi-
tory after dormitory is declaring
“home rule” for itself, a policy totally
incompatible with the creation of a
community. The next logical step af-
ter “home rule” is “floor rule,” and

A Need for New Racks

On this campus, which does not en-
courage vehicular travel, there is a
shortage of bicycle racks.

Recently, a bicycle rack was placed
outside All ll. But the rack accommo-

then "room rule," a situation which is
mere de jure anarchy.

In his decision Mr. Leggett, a
man of good intentions, tried to pro-
vide for the time afterwards, when I
procedural change could take place.
But by the administration’s past re-
fusal to grant a liberal and. fair ex-
tension of the visitation hours, and by
its conscious laxity in enforcing the
old rule, it also contributed to its weak
position, which will make it difficult
for the administration to deal with
students in the future.

The unfortunate situation with
Schneirov gave the president the op-
portunity to be a leader, to guide us
out of the mist of disorder which en-
velopes us. But he chose to be simply
an administrator, and in passing up
his opportunity he may have speeded
us to that day when students will de-
mand control of the financing of the
college and the awarding of contracts,

Faculty members have chosen to
be academic to the current crisis, per-
haps because they do not think that
the crisis affects them. They may have
doomed themselves, however, by their
silence, and by their failure to give
strength to a weak administration by
their support. Having won this vic-
tory, the students will move on, and
they will attempt to usurp the facul-
ty’s power. They will demand control
of the curriculum and, ultimately,
power to hire and fire professors.

A tempest of confusion is arising
at the college, With the elimination of
rules, the living situation will inev-
itably become intolerable. The re-
placement of rules with ”considera-
tion" is a casting off of all order.

Richard Schneirov has had his
fling and President Leggett has made
his decision, It is false to say, as some
do, that Mr. Leggett did not have jur-
isdiction in the case. The Judicial
Council was deadlocked, and Mr. Leg-
gett was fulfilling his executive duty,
which ls more than most house presi-
dents do, by deciding the case.

dates only five bicycles, and there are
often more than five riders who are in
ARH at one time. At least two more
racks should be placed there. Addi-
tional racks ought to be placed outside
the entrances to the dining halls.

Maior Grades Only

To the Editnri

The aim of a liberal educa-
tion is exposure to as many
fields of study as possible and
the development of a student's
ability in one particular field,
his major. This dlffers from the
aim of a technical education in
that the individual also benefits
through acquiring knowledge in
various areas.

One should be graded only for
his accomplishments in his ma-
jor field, not for that in his
other courses of study. A stu-
dent receives grades in his ma-
jor because graduate schools
need some means of evaluating
and comparing their applicunls.
Grades also help a student com-
pare himself to other students.
For these reasons grades can
be beneficial, Grades should not
be given in non-major courses
because a student takes these
only to improve himself as an
individual.

The purpose of required
courses is (0 make the student
more knowledgeable in courses
of study different from those of
his major. This is essential, for
u well rounded person is better
adapted to life and he is gener-
ally a more profound individual.
Yet it is detrimental to grade
someone while he is climbing
out of his cave, for rhis may
cause him to stay inside for
fear of failing in the new world.
Non-major courses should be
credit-fall. Under this plan all
“C" work or better would pass;
any work not up to “C" level
would fail. The student who is
not able to receive a passing
grade will not have a failure
enlered into his grade point av-
erage, but will have to repeat
the course until he merlis a
“C." Why draw the line at
“c"? Anything significantly be-
low "C" level work indicates
that the student has profited
little from the course; anything
significantly above “C" level
work often indicates knowledge
too specific to he of value.

Will a student put less effort
into a course if it is credit-fail?
It is true a student will prob-
ably put less effort into his
credit-fail courses, but that is
only because there is usually
less to be derived from courses
which are not going to be used
towards one’s major, imagine
all one could do with the rim.

and effort he would have! n.
might have time to do thing‘
which would credit him as I

time saved one could read (

Need for Obscenity
In 5&3 Noted

To the Editor:

The most dangerous way to
censor something is to ignore
its existence. This is the tech-
nique used by the 5&3 this term
in dealing with the so—called
“obscene" language.

Since “obscenity” is a matter
of the individual conscience, the
5&3, like The New York Times,
has no right to keep the reality
at news from its readers, and
then to impose its own “ob-
scene” language, by printing
such truly “obscene” words as
"hill" in its columns while re-
fusing to print such healthy and
lite-giving words akbut l sup-
pose you would refuse to print
any words which I altered as
examples even in the antiseptic
context of this letter. So I shall
have to rely on general and
common sense of vulgarity to
supply your deficiencies.

it seems to the perfectly ap-
propriate, and since sn-called
“ohscenities” represent a good
deal of the normal ethos 0!
American culture, the 5&3 has
a moral obligation to reflect
America as it is.

No Love 5 Labors Lost on Critic I

By ELEONORF. SPIEGEL

Love’s Labour’s Lost is prob-
ably one oi the lirst plays in
which Shakespeare investigates
the tashions ot his day, such as
Euphuism, and the moral con
sequences oi adhering to those
fashions. Those of us not too
familiar with Elizabethan fash-
ions, or not even too lamiliar
with the play, missed many of
the jokes and some of the mean-
ing at the play. One might well
wonder why the theater depart»
ment chose this particular play
to produce, especially during
Homecoming, when the audience
was largely parents who had
probably not read the play he—
iorehand. Perhaps since iemale
virginity has been such a ter-
vently discussed topic this se-
mester. the theater department,
seeing that there is another side
to the coin, telt obliged to put
on a play dealing with male
celibacy; and perhaps, by pro-
ducing It ior parents, they hoped
to win back some donations
which the Schneirov case has
lost us. But that is only my opin-
fan; you are each entitled to
your own.

In spite of the diliiculty o! the
play, the cast, for the most part.
gave a good performance. M .
Fritz Schwaller might have been
I little less earnest sometimes,
but he made up ior that detect
by a clarity and strength of
diction which some of the other
characters lacked. The role ol
Berowne must have been a hard
one for a man of Mr. William
Saylor'a energy and intensity;
but, except for the scene in
which he yields so seriously to
Cupid, he portrays a jesting,
mocking lord very well.

I was afraid that the Princess,
played by Elizabeth Wichmann,
and her ladies might suffer from
the same faults the King and
his lord did; but, to my pleasant
surprise. they were almost an
tirely charming, gentle, and
feminine. Miss Patricia Cor-
bett’s rendering oi Maria was

girlish and funny but some~
times a little overdone.

Mr. Charles Kimbmugh’u
wide experience was evident in
his periormnnce, He managed
to express pomposity in his
very bearings, and his intona-
tion was fully that of an old
courtly gentleman. AS for Dull
(Dennis Wilson), Nathaniel (Ned
Benton), and Holoiemes (Arthur
Knowles). they were so good in
their respective roles that i
hope most earnestly, for their
sakes, that they were not type-
cast. Moth (Ricki Ravilts), with
her boyish impudence, and Cos-
tard (Michael Grant), who was
so iunny as the sly and simple
clown, came dangerously close
to stealing their scenes and un-
doubtedly provided the best
comedy in the play,

When Marcade (P o rte r
Woods) came slowly up the
stairs in tront oi the stage,
someone behind me booed loud—
ly, thinking that the Villain of
the melodrama had now come;
and i myseli was taken aback,
wondering what Abraham Lln—
coin was doing in a Shakespear-
can play. But that was the only
instance of lncongruus costum-
ing that struck me; the other
costumes all seemed pleasingly
appropriate.

The ending at the play, on
Thursday night, began to re-
semble a grand finale, as all the
characters came out to dance
around the maypoles, but what
should have been the climax
was lost in applause, because
the actual finish of the play was
ambiguous. Whatever effect that
ambiguity was supposed to pro~
duce did not occur, unless con-
fusion was intended; and it
seemed a shame to end the
perloi‘munce in that way. But.
oi the perlormance as a whole,
I must say that those at us who
saw it loved it, though we la-
bored to catch some or the jokes,
and those of you who missed it
have lost that lovely experience
torever.

—Brotherhood, Re-publius

Where the Truth Lies . . .

Ey DONALD STUMP

Two weeks ago the latest additions to the growing list or
lltudent publications were made with the bll‘th of The Brotherhood
from the Concerned Black Students and Re-puhllus from th-
Young Republicans. Curiously enough, both papers seem to have
the same motto: not “All the news that’ii fit to print,” but rather

» “All the views that lit. we’ll print."

Neither publication succeeded, in its first issue, in establishing
I coherent reason for existence or an editorial policy. The Brother-
hood ostensibly contains “articles written by individual Black stile
dents to relate to the white community what it is to be Black in
Grinnell College." The quotation of Don Lee, howeveryplaced in
I box beside the paper's flag. comes closer to expressing the intent
of the articles and editorials of the first issue. it says, “I seek tho
integration ot Negroes with Black peoplesVMost of the paper
was addressed to fellow Black students with the purpose of gain- '
trig unity and political power.

Republius states as its purpose "to present issues of any na-
ture relevant to our time that demand consideration and evoko
responsible action." The phrase is what one might expect from a
young party paper: plationn prose aimed at disproving the state-
ment “You can't please all of the people all of the time.”

I fear that the failure to use reason and examine'the goal.
which ought to shape the editorial policies of the two papers will
either doom or damn them in the future. In the case of The Brotlb
zrtiood, the policy of trying to unite everyone who is Black, rs-
gardless of their characters and their moral and political aims,
will damn it. in the publication CBS seems to have gone the way
of! Richard Schneirov into blind commitment to a revolution by any
means and with any leaders who have power. In one article it is
written,

If you can’t dig the (Black Panthers) . . . you have to ho

a Tom or (1 Chuck. '

Don’t put your brothers down. They’re blood.

The N.A.A.C.P., a bunch of Toms, tells us we can’t make

it hating. They must be crazy.

Throughout the paper, lssues are polarized and the wisdom o1
integration is rejected without any more attempt to argue against
it than the claim that it was "the white answer for years.” What:
good can a paper do that throws out the goal oi the entire Civil
Rights Movement and accepts the color of men's skin as tho
pr‘inctple organization in society without any coherent attempt to
argue the case? What use is a paper which makes ialse distinc-
tions and blurred ones, such as the emotional use of the word
“colonial" to describe the relation of “Black America” to “White
America." How helpful to anybody are the unsubstantiated charges
oi racism in the grading at Black students by white professors,
especially in a paper which is racist itself? It the purpose at The
Brotherhood is to unite Blacks, it unites them at the cost of their
reason,

Re-publlus is not damned by irrationally and power politics
yet, but if it does not deiine its own purpose, it may be doomed
to die of aimlessness. I wonder what the editors would do if
someone submitted an article praising Hubert ilumphrey, who
certainly “demands consideration" and "responsible action” at tho
moment. It seems to me that the publication will serve its best
purpose if it reveals the nature at the party it represents and the
wisdom of the party’s policies. I am afraid that it will founder if
it attempts to criticize at large something as big as all of society.

The Brotherhood and Re-puhiius both illustrate a general dis-
trust ol reason which, quite ironically, pervades Grinnell's student
body. CBS has made no use of the education of its staii to try to
understand their actions in the “real world.” Re-publlus suiters
from uncertainty that even the party which it represents can be
defended rationally, as evidenced by the reprinting oi Lippmann’s
resigned acceptance of Nixon and the absence of any probing of the
party philosophy except in Ira Bolnick's short article. One wonders
how well prepared students are for tackling the "real world" when

,we cannot yet use our well trained. probing minds to examine our

political commitments.

4-Point Proposal
Before Committee

in a titty-minute talir before
the Student AITairs Committee
Tuesday, James Magee (Politi-
oal Science) blamed students,
laculty. and administration for
the current dormitory visttalion
problem. He ieeis that because
the students and administration
have toiled to solve the problem.
the solution rests with the facul-

cyMaigee stressed his opinion
that the college cannot possibly
accept “home rule" because
students would not enforce the
rules for other students, and
the college cannot be responsi-
tile for students under such con-
ditions,

Magee altered a four-point
Ernposal with the goal of recog-

izing the fact that individuals
mature dramatically and at
different rates during college
His suggestions were: 1) the
organization oi freshman halls
with upperelassmen to serve as
oounselors and supervisors.
l‘hese advisors should be re-
sponsible to the college and con-
genial to the rules; 2) an in<
crease in the offecarnpus non<
dorm living option; 3) a series
or dormitory living options from
which students may choose
;(none including a 24-hour opens
option)? 4) a statement in the
catalogue and to parents that
violation of rules would be pun-
(shedi

For the duration of the cur-
rent school year, Magee sug-
gested that no change be made
in the rules except ior an open
lounge option which, he felt,
would take care of the problem
of legal Visitation. He also pro-
posed that the role of resident
advisers be reexamined, and
that these nles be made more
responsible.

Magee explained that there is
no sense in iiberalizing rules
when students have made it
clear that no rules would be ene
Iorced, He added as the political
lesson that there is some sense
in keeping the outside commun<
icy ignorant of the de facto sit-
venom

ize that, if East's bid was legit-
imate, his partner could have at
a maximum 5 points, raised to
3 diamonds, which was passed
out.

When the dummy was laid
down, South was able to draw
some valuable conclusions about
East’s hand. Observing that the
missing points totalled 16. he
knew that they were all in
East's hand, due to the one N.T.
opening, He also assumed that
the distribution would be fairly
even in all tour hands. He
ducked West‘s opening lead of
the 10 of hearts, which East
took With the queen. East, ﬁnd
ing himself endplayed in all
four suits, returned the king of
Spades to the board's ace. South
then iinessed the diamond jack,
taking the queen in his hand. A
spade lead to East's queen was
returned to his own jack. A
round of trump was played in
which East’s 10 took the boards
9. To prevent (messing himself
in clubs or hearts, East returned
a diamond t0 the board’s ace,
drawing all but one trump in
declarer’s hand. South ledout
the 13th spade, on which he
dropped a heart after East
Sloughcd a club. He then cashed
his heart ace and rutied a low
heart in his hand. Playing East
for 3 clubs to the kingejack,
50th led a club to the 9 on the
board and East took the trick
With the 10. he was left With
the king-jack, the lead or either
of which gave South the two
tricks he needed to make the

did not comment on how these
policies were to be enforced. in
the statement prepared by Bon-

The Student Curriculum Com-
mittee of 22 members met Wetl-
nesday. They generally agreed
that there has been little im-
provement over last year's cur-
riculum. Ideally, they would
like to see the institution of
credit—fail grading in all non»
major courses.

Among those at the meeting
were Don Marquardt, chair—
man; Mr. Kurz, Sociology De-
partment; Dennis Dunham,
R. A.; Ernest T. Weston, Fresir
dent of 6.3.5.; and Molly Mal-
colm of S.D.S,

Mr. Kurz pointed out that
there are many faculty mem-
bers who are in favor or a
change of curriculum for the
good or the college. They leel
that these changes should be
made in curriculum policy rath-
er than simply in a few courses.

Marquardt, who disagreed
with having courses required,
iceling they don‘t allow choice,
asked "How good is a common
experience?"

But Miss Malcolm disagreed
saying, “We (at Grinnell) should
have more a sense or mission;
students need to be exposed
to courses they normally
wouldn’t take.”

In reply Marquardt asked
whether we should put students
in ditterent classes according to
ability. Miss Malcolm, who is
vehemently opposed to tracking
by ability feels that stlldents
can learn from each other.
“There is no need for students
to have a common heritage as
long as they have common prob-
lems.”

A student concluded the dis-
cussion saying, “It’s not that
everyone has read the lliad;
it's that everyone can read the
Iliad.”

All students and faculty are
invited to the next meeting of

SECRET ADVICE
FOR WOMEN

By PHOEBE CLAIRE

“Men always want to he a
Woman's first love. That Is
their clumsy vanity. We wom—
en have a more subtle instinct
about things. What we like is
to be a man’s last romance."

Oscar Wilde

Girls, I am writing this col-
umn to help you in what is the
most important adventure in
your liic a catching a man.
Grinnell College itself presents
certain problems in this pur-
suit, but with a little clever:
ness and just a bit of scheming,
you can get the man you want.

Every man, even the stupid—
est 03f, thinks that he is “hot
stuff.” The smart girl Will cons
vinCe her eyes apple that he
is not “hot" to the world, but
he is berore her eyes alone.
This Way he will feel superior
only in your company, and it
you are the smart girl that you
are, his vanity will be ap-
peased and you will have taken
your lirst step in shoving him
into that intellectllal contusion
that is called falling in love.
Falling in love with you really
means that you have made him
fall in love with himself.

Men are, in general, vulgar,
bad-tempered, ill-mannered,
lazy, and violent. These charac-
teristics are so bad that lf any
man saw himselt the way he
really is, he would know that
he was unfit to live, and he
would commit suicide. Why
do so few men kill themselves?

Nature has instilled into ev-
ery man a small helping ot
sell-love. This is an indulgent,
Pandemian kind of love. It
makes a man overlook his
faults, or at least tolerate
them. This selfrluve is how na-
ture implants the will to sur-
vive in men.

Now we girls mllst help na-
ture along. We must increase
this self-love of theirs, and by
doing this we endear ourselves
to them.

i have used up all my space,
But it you need any adVice ot
a private natute, send a post-
card to me c/o the Scarlet and
Black and I will send you
the needed answers.

} Saga Strike
(Continued from Page I)

Saga workers would have to be
extended around campus, ac»
cording to Pomerenk. All cam-
pus jobs are granted through
the linancial aid program, al-
though many workers are not
receiving a iinancial aid pack-
age from the School. Of the 375
students employed on campus,
210 work for Saga.

Next February 1, the base
pay will increase to shall/hr. as
a result of a new minimum
wage law. At that time, accord-
ing to Mr. Pomerenk, all incre-
ments Will be eliminated. Dur-
ing the last three years the
base wage has risen lrom
ESC/hr. with increments to the
present level.

"we are not at all pleased
with the threat of a strike,"
said Pomerenk, “because it is
not appropriate to the special
relationship between the college
and the workeis." He was re-
rerring to the tact that jobs are
granted as I iorm of financial
aid.

According to Shaw, “the
Quad workers will strike Sat—
urday morning as a matter or
principle and will hold out until
the demands are met" if there
are no developments in Friday's
meeting.

Student workers in the Quad
had a chance to sign one or two
petitions. One stated that they
were willing to strike; the other
stated that they were sympathe-
tic With the strikers but for
economic reasons could not
strike, 69 workers signed the
first petition; the remaining five
signed the second. Student
workers at Cowles have no plans
to either strike or support the
strikers at the Quad,

Shaw expects support lrom
other students and some mem»
bers of the administration and
faculty, but the Quad workers
have not solicited the aid or any
other students. “We feel that
this is Just between Saga, the
college, and us," said Shaw.
The rumored student strike or-
ganlzed by the SDS is entirely
unrelated to the Saga strike.
Shaw was unaware of the SDS'S
plans.

For hungry students “food
servtce Will be provtded in the
event Of a strike,” Said Mr.
Hand. “We hope that there will
not be a Strike; this Could be
settled before Saturday morn<
lng.”

capable oi taking meaningtui
action upon an issue or great
concern to the college COl'l'll'l'lu-
nity.” Their statement repri-
manded the council for present-
ing the Student Affairs Com<
mittee with proposals tor
changes rather than to the stu-
dent body. The statement also
defended the actions of Grant
Crandall and the Senate, who
had been reprimanded by the
court.

In an ettort to inﬂuence the
president, a petition was circle
lured by the local sps charging
that the president did not have
the jurisdiction to decide the
case.

Entire Senate
Supports Cornell
Black Students

on Wednesday, Oct. 23, the
Student Senate passed unant-
mously a resolution presented
by Tom Thomas supporting the
Black Students‘ demands at
Cornell college, and condemn
ing the administration’s hark
dling oi the situation. The reso.
lution was then sent it? Dr. 9.
E. Stumpt, president of Con-
nell, and to The Cornellian.

The proposal to the Senate by
Thomas was a reaction to what
he considered a poor way of
handling the disturbance which
occurred at Cornell on Oct, 17.
The Black students of Cornell
put on a demonstration and
took over the administration
building before their demand.
were made known to the Cole
lege ofﬁcials. The trustees de-
cided to expel the students, but
later modified their judgment
to immediate suspension until
disciplinary action could be
taken for the charge or dison
derly conduct. ‘

In a personal letter to Presto
dent Stumpf, Thomas con-
demned the administration’-
failure to operate through the
regular channels that had been
set up to deal with this type of
problem. As Thomas stated in
the letter, “Separating the le-
gitimacy or the students’ de.
mands and the manner of their
presentation irom the question
of discipline for their actions —
as I think must be done —‘ I be-
lleve the College's decision was
unduly arbitrary, unfortunate-
ly pressured, and unnecessarily
harsh.

“in any case 01 civil disobe-
dienCe the individual must be
prepared to suffer Conse-
quences, but he also has the
right to expect that these con-
sequences be rendered by legal
procedure, Institutional reaction
in such cases must not come
through ex post facto policy. i
believe that in this case the ill-
Considered action of the admire
istration is subject to far greats
er condemnation than the ac-
tions of the students."

Thomas went on to mom
mend immediate reinstatement
of the students, disciplinary
action through prescribed Chan-
nels, and only then, after the
set system has been shown due
respect, the consideration or the
students' status as affected by
a demonstration.

The Senate resolution sent to
the president and The Cornel-
lian included the same ideas as
Thomas’ original letter, and
also urged the immediate im-
plementation of three or the fOtLI'
of the BIack students' demands,
which tire: 1) that 10% of the
convocation lecturers be Black;l
2) that a Black curriculum be
set up and instituted; 3) that
Black instructors and at least
one Black adviser be hired by
the college. The fourth propos-
al, that there be built a Black
Strident Center, was also urged
for consideration.

PIONEERS EDGE BELOIT;l GRAY MATTER l .
SCOTS SMASH US 50-0

By REGGIE GRAHAM

In an effort to please parents
and alumni. the Pioneers won
their second game of the sea-
son by beating Beloit, 2422. In
case you didn't realize that this
was an upset. the Chicago Trib-
une had Beloit picked 19-6, and
I can't remember another Grin-
nell game the Tribune missed!

Grinnell made one touchdown
per quarter for the first three,
with Johnson's passes adding
two points each time .lon Bus-
well scored twice, once from
thirty-three yards out. Jon
played a fantastic game. carry-
lng the ball seventeen times and
gaining five first downs. Rumor
has it that Steve hutchings
made twenty tackles; he and
Tom Lower played excellent
games at the linebacker spots,
Steve was in on the tackle that
stopped Knox halfback Burch
on the six inch line in their two
point conversion bid (it would
have tied the game)r Alex Kar-
lln and Bob Lillis did well on
the defensive line — Alex’s per.
formance was topped by his re<
ccvery of a Beloit fumble on
our 28, stopping a thirty-eight
yard drive.

Beloit's Young (HR) was our
main headache that day. Alone.
except for one seven yard carry
by Gross, he ran ten straight

downs. driving a total of forty-
ono yards. setting up Beloit'o
first touchdown. During their
second touchdown drive, he
carried the ball seven out of
eleven times gaining 35 of the
53 yards. Beloit made its third
touchdown on a had interfer-
ence call and a trapped ball in
the end zone.

The Pioneers played their
best game of the season against
Beloit. We were aided by some
lucky breaks. such as fumbled
and well timed penalties. We
lost no fumbles and had no
passes intercepted. The defense
played a very good game; and
pass defense was great The
best defensive action of the
game was our ability late in
the second quarter to hold
Beloit for four downs on our 27.

Monmouth’s Homecoming

The game last Saturday
against Monmouth wasn’t nearly
as cheerful for Pioneer fans.
Badly outweighed, the Pioneer
defense was able to hold amaz«
ingly well for the iirst ten min-
utes of the game. Monmouth
couldn't make any yards on the
ground, and got no first downs
(we made three). Late in the
first quarter, however, a long
bomb set them up for their first
touchdown They scored only
one touchdown per quarter for
the iirst three quarters. In the

last quarter. however, Moli-
mouth's first string was able to
run up twenty-seven points after
Coach Bowers took out our
starters.

Monmouth's main scorers
were Schneider, who caught
three touchdown passes from
quarterback Tom Lombardo,
and halfback Coole, who ran two
touchdowns (as well as gaining
another 191 yards). Their kick-
Br, Phil Motzer, kicked five
points afterwards, and one field
goal from the forty-two in the
second quarter.

As far as total yards gained,
the Pioneers looked pretty had.
We managed to make a total of
only 152 yards compared to
their 493. We lost three fumble:
and had one pass intercepted.
but luckily were able to punt
eight times. Grinnell was
up against a team that wall
picked to have a shot at the
number one spot in tha confer.
once. and was just badly out<
played.

This week we play Lawrence,
and although they usually have
a tough team, they are not that
strong this year. The teams will
be up for the game, but with
the quality we showed against
Beloit. plus the same fine
nerve, we might take another
one.

Come see, Saturday 1:30,

KNOX REMATCH UP
FOR SOCCER CLUB

The Grinneli Pioneers will trad
val to Knox tomorrow to face
the Siwash in our final soccer
match of the season. The game
is a rematch of an earlier meet-
ing this season. in which Knox
scored a 3-2 victory.

Coach J o h n Hemingway
thinks that his Pioneers. who
currently have a 3—2 record, will
be up for this game. A victory
would even the score with Knox
for this season and give Grinnell
one of its best records in recent
years.

Harvey Nagpur. the Slwash
leit wing, is expected to be the
biggest threat to tho Pioneers.
According to Coach Hemings
way, he has figured in each of
Knox’s most recent victories
over Grinneli. Says Heming-
way, in commenting on Nagpur,
"He beat us last year and ill
beat us again this year." But
the Pioneers have been drilling
hard and should be ready thil
time.
