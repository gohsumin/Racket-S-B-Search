'; The 5813 has been reminded by Building and
Grounds that the students are again busy making paths
here and there across the green expanses of the campus.
Although we would be the first to grant, along with
Student voices, that “the sidewalks are in the wrong
place,” it seems that thoughtful students could do
away with some of the short cuts across new grass
areas. Spring is a pleasant time of year here # students
should be able to take a little extra time to make it
pleasant for B&G as well as for themselves.

Baffled Board?

The “integrated" living situation on South Campus
has been very well planned and handled by the AWS
Board. Every possible effort is being made to make
Main and Mears, formerly freshmen dorms, invi rig to
upperclass residents. With room-drawings, just two
weeks away, the Board is now busy choosing Baffle—
board officers for each dorm floor in the quad. Some-
times, it seems, baffleboard members apply for rea
sons of gaining prestige, getting early choice of rooms,
or acquiring a stepping stone toward next years AWS
Board candidacy. The AWS Board seems vitally inter-
ested in making its dorm system work. The choice of
baffleboard members and their subsequent position in
the hall will undoubtedly emerge more important than
ever. Placing freshmen in all the dorms, and the theory
behind it, necessitated a new type of community living
in the quad. Without being policemen or full-time
advice counselors, the baffleboard members will have
an active part in creating and maintaining community.
This should certainly be considered in the already
difficult job of choosing the best people for the posi-
tion.

l Spoilers at the Polls

Six percent of the students who voted in the
Mock Election had their ballots spoiled because of their
misuse of the voting machines. The PPPE had repre-
sentatives present at all times to explain the machines
in order to avoid just such an event. It looks like getting
people out to vote is not the only problem at the polls
-—one should also be sure that they pay enough atten-
tion so that they know what they are doing. Spoiling
a ballot through carelessness doesn't say much for the
privilege to vote.

Time Goes By

It is ironic that Grinnell students, who are eternal-
ly desperate for time. will find themselves losing one
hour this week-end. The thought has already spread
panic among several paper-writers and exam takers.
The only pleasant thought right now about going on
daylight savings time, is that next October we will all
gain an hour when things get back to normal.

If It’s Your Birthday —- Hope It’s Happy

 

 

To the Editor:

We are accustomed to speak—
ing about different "genera
tions" of college Students which
are believed to have a more or

less unique identity. The appel-
lations “angty”, “lost”, and
“complacent” have been used
to describe some of these gen-
erations. Realizing the hazards
of generalization, we may still
profit from an attempt to fit
the contemporary generation
of college students into this
same framework.

The frequency with which
they use the Word "meaning
ful" offers us me best clue to
an identity for these young peo-
ple. The very use of the word
“meaningful" suggests the are
istence of something which is
“meaning—less.’ Inherent in
such a View are attitudes of
examination, skepticism, and
experimentation — all qualities
ascribed to this particular gen-
oration.

 

Philosophers, sociologists and
psychologists have launched a
massive criticism of contemr
porary middle class suburban
values. The essence of their
objections has been that mid—
dle class society has wed itself
to the spiritually sterile values
of chronic status consciousness
and excessive concern for ma-
terial well-being.

It is against this background
that the current college group
should be set in order to under
stand their preoccupation with
meaningful existence. For bet
ter or for worse, most of this
generation cannot value relig-
ion highly enough to find in it a
convincing scheme of life val-
ues. At the Same time. both the
absence of sound values in so-
ciety at large, and‘the psycho~
logically crippling effects of
that absence of meaning have
been made woefully apparent.

What has resulted is a gener-
ation which deeply impressed

in life. Two cults have devel<
oped to fill the value vacuum.
One would make love the ulti-
mate value in life. The Bible of
this cult is Fromm's The Art

The other cult views life as

in the state of experiencing
things, hence sheer experience
becomes an end in itself.

The highly publicized sexual
experimentation of the contem-
porary college group may per-

stood if we consider the twin
values of love for love’s sake
and experience as an end in it-
self.

While it is too early to assess
the workability of these Values,
it is possible to note that psy-

By VINCE ANKU

Ghana’s government has no
interest in either ruthless com-

munism or moribund capital»
ism. She is pursuing her own
independent course; yet Nkru-
mah has been accused of being
a Communist running a Soviet
satellite. This accusation is not
only a monstrous distortion of
truth, but also shows a gross
ignorance of what Communism
really is. I believe that the
Russian, Chinese, or Cuban
brand of Communism is bound
to fail in Ghana. In Ghana, over
ninety per cent of the people
are land owners who would rcr
act violently to any attempt by
the government to collecthlze
their land or any personal prop-
erty. The government would
have to imprison or liquidate
the land owners in order to col-
lectivize all the agricultural
land.

Moreover. many prominent
government officials and their

 

close relatives are also land
owners. The government’s aim
is to help the people live a bet-
ter life, and so it cannot pmr
vide the good life on the blood
of the majority of the people.
it would be stupid to attempt
to collectivize tropical cocoa
growing forests where adequate
supervision of workers is im-
possible. Without collectiviza-
lion, Ghana farmers still pro-
duce more than a third of the
world's cocoa. For these rea
sons the government is making
no effort to “collectiVlze for
the sake of collectivization,"
which seems to be the case in
some communist countries.
Just as Communism would
be detrimental to Ghana, so
would the American form of
capitalism prove disastrous to
her. Ghana's government needs
a great deal of money. The
people are quite reluctant to
pay taxes, and voluntary con-
tributions have only recently

come into prominence. Thus,
Ghana must plan her economy
very thoroughly. She strongly
feels that the somewhat
efficient capitalistic System is
not the quickest way to the bet-
ter future. Ghana blends West-
ern and Eastern economic
theories with her own expel’h
ence. Though Ghana perhaps

borrows much from Marx and
Lenin, this is not a sufficient
ground on which to label Ghana
a Communist satellite. This will
become apparent In the later
articles.

Ghana is building an anal:
getlc country based on the
principles of African Socialism.
This is a social, political, and
economic System permeated
by belief in God and thus in the
dignity of the individual man,
Ghanians believe that African
Socialism will provide the
greatest economic progress
while reasserting the tradition-
al cooperative values of Afri-
can life.

In April 1961, Nkrumah made
the following statement in the
New York Times:

“The aim of the party is to
build a socialist State in which
the free development of each
sector is a condition for the free
development of the other sec-
tors of society. This is conson-
ant with African situations,
conditions, and Circumstances.”

Mr. Nkrumah has said time
and time again that private in-
vestment, elther domestic or
loreign, and state ownership
can coexist in Ghana. This is
one of the features of "African
socialism.” It is based not on
the concept of class struggle,
but on traditional cooperative
principles in which private
ownership plays a Vigorous
part in the society. This deft
nitely is not Communism.

The Senate Scene

By WADE STEVENSON

The Student Senate Wednesday night defeated a motion to
appropriate $270 for a broken science building windowr A1 Gum<
merson, C of HP representative, spoke in favor of the motion
and explained that there was sufficient evidence to indicate
that a student had broken the window with an empty liquor
bottle, >

During debate, a number of senators wished to know why
the person responsible for the damage could not be appres
hendedr Gummerson indicated that certain people knew who the
guilty party was, but these people would not testify again?
the person, When the vote was taken on the motion, not :-
single senator voted to appropriate the money

The Executive Cabinet vetoed a Senate resolution which
required campus organizations to submit “detailed statement:
of financial condition" to the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Marilyn Alt moved that the vetoe be overridden by the Senate.

While debating Miss Alt’s motion, Phil Johnson, S. G A.
President, said that “when the Student Senate starts to in-
volve itself in every organization’s finances, the Student GOV-
ernment will get bogged down,” Johnson also said that such a
resolution would cause an "inordinate amount of trouble.”

Nancy Cox, chairman of the Appropriations Committee,
said that “after talking with the Student Auditor, it is apparent
that he thinks the resolution is a good one."

After sufficient debate, the Senate upheld the Executive
Cabinet's veto.

Phil Johnson introduced a car rule resolution which read
in part that the Student Senate “requests that the present rule
be clearly defined, with attention to:

a. The consequences of a violation of the rule.

b. The offices responsible for the administration of the rule.

1:, The procedures to be used in handling any violation or

request for exemption"

In favoring the resolution, Johnson stated that “nobody
seems to know who is responsible for car rule decisions and
nobody seems to know who is responsible for apprehending the
violators.

Karen Adkinson Stated that “the Senate would be yielding
initiative if it voted for this measure. Also, not enough time
was given for Senators to come up with alternative proposals
or amendments.” Miss Adkinson then moved that the resolution
be postponed for a week. The motion was adopted by the Senate.

Sam Grossman, Jerry Goddard, and Ed Johnson were ap-
proved as menlbers of the Men's Primary Court.

in a final bit of business, M " yn Alt moved that the Sen-
ate send a directive to Paul Courtright to pick up a pop machine
money box from Mrs, Lord in Haines Halli Miss Alt indicated
that she had talked to Courtrlght at least three times about
the money box.

Nancy Cox explained that "Mr. Courtright has just gotten
a typhoid shot and is a bit under the weather," Miss Cox indi-
cated that a directive would not be necessary and that she
would talk to Mr. Courtright about the money box. Amid ap<
plause and laughter, the Senate defeated Miss Alt's motion for

Continued sending of Grin-
nell Travel»SerVice Scholars to
Ahmednagar each year and ex—
change of students for specified
periods of study are other fac-
ets of the program.

Use of qualified Ahmednagar
faCulty members as visiting
locturers at Grinnell would also
be involved. Grinnell has al-
ready had one Ahmednagar
representative—Thomas Barna-
bas, principal (president) of
the collegevas a visiting pro-
fessor of chemistry here, dur-
ing the first semester this
year.

Pointing out his conviction
that such an expanded pro-

SCARLET AND BLACK

: Eclgren Describes Airican Town
. As Seen By American

By John Edgren
Grinnell Travel Scholar
The school is lodged on ﬁle
side of a mountain. it overlooks
a plain, level, triangular, rather

like a tongue, splayed forth-

from a root to the left of and a
little behind the school's moun-
lain, Malosa. Pooled in a de-
pression toward the tip of that
tongue is a lake, Ohilwa, a
clear brilliant line of reflected
sunlight beyond which rise the
mountains of Portuguese East
Africa, On the tongues opposite
side, running down to the lake,
is a series of mountains; the
throat to which these hills nar-
row is choked by the nearest
post office and a small village,
Kasupe, four miles distant, The
school is lodged in the molars
of the countryside; it is part of
the enamel that covers that

, soft, most basic dentine of
earth and rock upon which die
nation rests.

This is, as I said, a school,
but a school twice qualified, It
is a boarding school and a mis-
sion school. It is due mostly to
.these latter considerations that
the establishment climbs the
mountain as it does, the school,
and the dormitories for boys,
being separated by a mile of
dirt road winding around the
mountain side, several hundred
feet of altitude, and a hospital,

, from the mission station proper
where are housed the staff, and
around which huddle the dormi»
tories for girls. It is from
this station, called Mkuli, that
one can most easily see the re«
lation of the school to the sur<
rounding land, can most clear-
ly see the teeth rising opposite
and the lake, can most clearly
feel the isolation of me school.

It is these latter considera-
tions as well that make the
most striking modifications of
What might be called the school-
ness of the place. Here are
classes held and subjects
taught; the course is ancient,
time—honored, v enerable:
mathematics, English history,
science; the fingers of the aca-
demic world penetrate to this
slow place and make their just
demands, but here also Is held

that boys and girls will have a

if ineliectually, enforced. The
buildings, the people, sprinkled
around the skirts of this moun-
tain serve not so much the ab-
stract and principled demands
of education and learning, as
they do the ideal of remaking a
race, a nation, a people, an in-
dividual, in the image of their
mentors.

This small bit of isolation,
this hard surface on the nation’s
softness, slowly molds the
people sent here, slowly masti-
cates them to a pliable consis-
tency, shaping them to a new
form. Any good school does
this; it is unalterable, even de-
sirable. The challenge dropped
by the nature of that process
to those who participate in it
is, oi course, what form is to
be sought; it is, if you will, the
shape of the enamel. That chal-
lenge has here been picked up,
and the reshaping of the enamel
provides the dynamic element
in educational goals as this na»
tion moves toward independ-
ence. The enamel, ultimately, it
is clear, must fit the dentine;
the schools of this nation must
serve the most basic underly-
ing character of the nation or
crack and splinter as they wear
away at its succeeding genera-
tions.

The progress of dynamic
change as these small bits of
social enamel begin to revert
to the basic truths of the land
and its people, as colonialism
passes and the independence of
July strides nearer, has begun
to be evident. The amount
spent on education has in-
creased by several times in the
last five years: church affili-
ated students are no longer
sent to c h u r c h affiliated
schools; less than one quarter
of the students here now are
Anglican; there is an influx of

less Americans among the Brit-

ish clerics; in all of these and
more can be seen the decay of
the old order. The tensions of
this process too, are evident in
the faces and lives of those who
struggle to maintain their
lines against the inexorable
change. Boys labor daily, cut-
ting the school’s plentiful grass
as punishment for skipping
chapel services they can see no
reason for attending. They are
supervised by missionaries, in
dustrious, a little grim, who
privately despair the attitudes
of these new young, the increas-
ing age of secondary school pu-
pils, the growing trend toward
secular education. Where will
it end? It can never end, but

All,“

By JIM FISH
S & B Sports Editor

Grinnell‘s track team journeys 'this weekend to the Drake
relays in Des Moines, where they will face some of the tough-
est college competition in the nation. Pioneer Coach Dick
Young has entered his men in five relay events and in three
of the open individual events.

Coach Young will take his ace relay team of Ron Schac-
he], Jeri Langham, John TePaske, and Bruce Beckord, who
will no doubt be facing their toughest opponents of the season.
Coach Young has the quartet entered in the sprint medley
invrtational where theywill run against top relay teams from
schools such as Texas Southern, Lamar Tech, and Lincoln
University.

Young’s relay team will also be defending its 880-yard
and mile relay championships won last year in the Iowa
College division. Grinnellians who braved the elements to
see the team run last year saw Fred Berg make a courageous
finish after pulling a thigh muscle about 50 yards from the
finish line. Berg was able to make it across the line to clinch
the first in the Sad-relay. With Berg out for the day, Coach
Youn had to call trackman Fred Arnold out of the stands to
take erg’s place in the mile relay. The team of Arnold, John
Edgren, Jeri Langham, and Bruce Beckord combined to take
another first with a time of 13:22.3 in the mile event.

Entering the individual events for the Pioneers will be
Rod Brown in the two mile run, Tom Wood in the Javelin,
and Jim Miller in the shot put. Miller, just last week, broke
the college shot put record with a heave of 491%”.

The Pioneers, who haven’t missed a Drake Relay for 51
years, have been named one of the honor teams at the Relays
his year. Grinnell, sharing honors with the University of
Minnesota, will be awarded a plaque by Relavs Director Bob
Karnes at the annual coaches dinner to be held tonight in
Des Moines.

This award, as well as the fact that the Olympics are
coming up this summer in Tokyo, moved this writer to do
a little investigation to see how Grinnell College runners
have done in the past half century, both in the Drake Relays
and in national and world competition.

Probably the best known of the Grinnell greats is Mor-

an Taylor, a hurdlerfwas the only American trackman ever
0 place among the top three in three consecutive Olympic
games. Taylor, ’25, broke the world’s record in winning the
400~meter hurdles at the 1924 games in Paris. In the 1928
games in Amsterdam he placed second, and in 1932, at Los
Angeles, he was able to take a third. Taylor still holds three
Grinnell College track records: 120-yard high hurdles in :14.7,
220-yard high hurdles in 223.2, and the broad jump with a
leap of 25’2".

Taylor’s coach‘, Harry J. (“Doc”) Huff, ’09, was a great
sprinter, clocking a sub ten second hundred yard dash. Huff
beat the country's top sprinters when he won both the 100
and 220-yard dashes in the Olympic tryout finals at James-
kown, Va. The Grinnell College Scarlet and Black reported

is running in-the 1908 Olympics in England as follows: “Soon
after his arrival in England. Huff contracted a severe cold,
due to the peculiar London climate, which with a sprained
ankle received on the second day of training, prevented his
appearing at his best. However, he won preliminaries in both
events, the 100 and 200 meter dashes, and was only narrowly
beaten in the semi-final.“

Other great names in Grinnell College track history in-
clude Charles Hoyt, ’18, national collegiate sprint champion;
Karl Hass, a dasllman who represented the United States in
the Pershing Olympics (Inter-Allied meet in Pershing Sta-
dium, Paris); Leonard Paulu, ’22, a Phi Bete who was a na»
national titlewinning sprinter; and “Iron Mike" Pilbrow, the
NCAA 2-mile champ in 1933. One could go on and on about
the good runners Grinnell has had who haven’t gained na-
tional fame. This would be an overwhelming task and I won’t
even try to begin to list some of these great runners.

Chief starter at the relays this year will again be Les
Duke ‘25, Grinnell track coach‘froin 1927 to 1947, and him»
self quite a trackman for the Pioneers. Mr. Duke is now with
the Ramsey Insurance Agency in Grinnell and is an avid
supporter of Grinnell track activities.

Added incentive for Grinnell students to attend the 1964
Drake Relays (well, at least for the men) will be the special
event Saturday afternoon featuring the “bouffanted” young
ladies from the Texas Track Club. The Texas club will meet
the five best 440Ayard Iowa high school girl’s relay teams.
Sharp-eyed readers of the April 20th issue of Sports Illus-
trated will recall the fetching cover picture and story which
told of the Texas Track Club and their coach who are dedi-
cated to the proposition that a girl can be beautiful and still
run the 100 in 10.9. See you at the Relays!

Tied for lsl in Southern Division

By Jack Harrod

Grinnell’s diamondmen fresh
from a dual win over Cornell
last week, return home for
three games this weekend
against Monmouth and Knox.
This afternoon the Pioneers
tangle with the Monmouth nine
and on Saturday mark the mid-
way point of the season by op-
posing the Siwash in a twin
bill.

On April 18th the Scarlet
pounded out identical 4-2 vii:-
tories over Cornell's Rams at
Mt. Vernon. Once again, fine
pitching paved the way with
Denny Hanssen going the route
in the opener while Barry M.
Anderson and Cal Collier
teamed up to win the nighteap.
Hanssen also Whiffed 12 batters
in his seven inning stint.

Nick Nonas lead the Pioneer
hitting attack against the
Rams by slamming a bases»
loaded triple in the second
game and driving in a total of
5 runs for the day. Nonas' six
hits in the twin bill boosted his
season batting average up to
.272.

Hanssen, Collier, Dave Syn-
burst and Dick Ulrich, who is
hitting .600, also picked up key
hits for the Scarlet. in a
marked improvement over past
performances, th e Grinnell
squad committed a total of
only one error in both con-
tests.

er.” Pfitsch attributes the fine
showing so far to a combina-
tion of things. The crew of
sophomores ‘on the roster,
many of whom did not play
frosh ball last year, have come
around at the plate and now
carry much of the hitting load
"If we keep up this hitting and
maintain our improved field-
ing, we might have a really
fine season,” predicted Pfitsch.

The major threat to the Pio-
neers hopes will come from
the Knox team that invades
Grinnell tomorrow. The Siwash
right now are tied with the
Pioneers for the lead in the
MCAC Southern Division, hold-
ing down a 3-1 conference rec-
ord and a [H overall mark.
Picked by the D. M, Register
for a pennant repeat this year,
Knox has most of its veterans
returning mis season, includ-
ing mound star Doug Ziech,
along with some fine hurling
prospects up from 1953’s fresh
squad,

This afternoon's opponent,
Monmouth, handed Knox their
only setback so far in the young
campaign. The Scots figure as
a dark horse in the pennant
race this year.

Slated for pitching duty for
the Pioneers this weekend are
Denny Hanssen, Barry M. An-
derson and Steve Tilly.

Thin Treads for Speed

AKRON, Ohio (AP) — Craig
Breedlove set a world’s land
speed record of 407 miles an
hour in his jet car “Spirit or
America" on tires with paper—
thin treads.

The tires were made that
way because centrifugal force
and heat, not wear. are the
chief problems in driving at
high speeds, says the Goodyear
Cd, designers of the tires.

Well, the baseball season‘s in
full swing eVen'if all of the
mighty 1M batters aren’t.

Even a few cold and dismal
days haven’t deterred the
many hale and hearty athletes
of North Campus, and only
once, last Monday, did Mr.
Truesdale have to restrain the
eager baseball addicts from
rushing the three playing fields
amidst the onslaught of a pun-
ishing rainstorm. Monday's
games were made up last Weds
nesday, however.

Dibble and South were the
teams to beat as of last Wed-
nesday noon, both‘teams boast-
ing a 3-0 record. Rawson and
Smith were up there too, how-
ever, with 2 wins and 1 loss
each. East is next with a 2-2
record. West and Clark are
likewise balanced, but with 1-1
records. North was l-Z, and
Cowles, Gates, and Langan
were doing an especially fine
job of holding down last place,

with 0-3, 0-2, and 0-2 record!
respectively. I’ll tell you some<
thing, though; if they gave
pomts to the team having the
most fun, Langan w o u i (
easily be in the lead.

It’s a little early yet to make
any accurate predictions, but
I'd guess South, East, and
maybe Rawson, if Rein Saral
can control his speedy pitch-
ing. will be among the top Con-
tenders, Dibble and Smith,
though, certainly can’t be dis
counted yet.

Track and Golf meets are
bout coming up. May 2, is the
Track date (May 9, if it rains),
and May i, and s, are the Golf
dates (or May ii, i! one date is
postponed).

in Track, I’d say watch Gates
or Dibble. Golf should be (21058.
but I've got a feeling East will
be tough. Whatever the out-
come, there should be pretty
good participation, and if you‘
possibly can, help out with of»
riciating at the Track meet. Til
next time.

New Head Waitress, Waiter Reign;
0am] Welcomes Georgia and Greg

By Pam Clay

, April 8th saw two new
people In control of the Quad
tuning room. Actually they are
not new to any of us; Georgia
Mickey and Greg Mace have
lbeen working into their new

gobs for months, and on April
they took over by them-
.elves. Sue Carpenter and Lar-

y Skogerson have been re-
Enquishing their duties and

elping the new head waiter
nd waitress get the feel of be-

g in command.

Sue, commenting about her
former job as head waitress,
told, ”The head waitress is re-
sponsible for all the waitress-
es; she has to make out the
Ichedule, do the payroll, and
try to keep people happy at
the same time.” Though she is
only responsible for working
lerved meals, Sue explained
that she always feels respon-
sible tor the Quad dining room
and is always aware of her re-
Iponsihilities.

“We (Larry and herself)
mostly watch to see how peo»
ple work, what their attitude is,
and correct any mistakes Ac-
tually, I work for Saga rather
than the college,” she said,
“We are mediators between the
student workers and Saga; it
is a middle-supervisory posi-
tion. Once you have the job you
can’t get away from it. People
come to you with their prob-
lems; they expect you to know
What is for dinner, who works
Where and why, etc. it is im-
possiblel But it is only as much
work as you make it~and it is
fun!”

“Two things bother me,"
Ihe laughed, ”Sometimes peo-
ple brush past me and say,
“Excuse me, Georgia! 1 hope
I have not lost my identity that
much, Birthday cakes are just
one of the crosses I bear; one
is okay, but when there are
three the same night. it is
Work!"

Larry Skogerson also had a

 

few things to say about his life
at the Quad. Something diners
don’t often realize is the job
he and Al Murray have of co-
ordinating between the kitchv

en and the dining room, The
food gets in and out pretty
fast sometimes!

”Of course, we work during
Commencement w e e k and
alumni weekend,” he said. “It
is especially fun to work when
the alums are here because
they have lots of memories to
bring up.” Larry is storing up
a tew memories of his own: it
seems that when he was a
sophomore, the lights went out
in the midst of a formal din-
ner. “It was not bad in the
dining room ‘since it was a
candlelight dinner,” he
laughed, “but it was not too
good in the kitchen—and it is
a good thing they came on be-
fore we had to wash dishes!
What peeves me? I guess it is
when people reserve a table
and don't come!”

Everyone agreed that there
is no formal training program
for the new head waiter and
waitress. It is mostly gradual-
ly letting them do the work and
get accustomed to the routine
so they are aware if a problem
or irregularity arises; it is ac-
quiring a feeling for the job.

Greg is looking forward to
his job as a good experience
in organization and human re-
lations. “As a character build»
er it will make me or break
me!” he joked, “The frustratv
ing thing is that we don’t real-
ly do anything with our hands.”
Greg did mention a few vices
Commonly noted in the Quad:
“They (the girls) wander
around on cloud nine at any
cafeteria meal and haven’t the
dimmest recollection of the
seating plan. And all that com-
plaining about a long line!
There are Continual little crises
——llke waiters not showing up
and dishes breakingibut the
job is actually a labor of love
and marvelously stimulating."

 

Georgia has numerous small
details to occupy all her spare
time. Hair nets, no crumbs,
clean tables, etc... are very Irn-

portant for a smooth running,
disciplined dining room, and to
preserve an image of gracious
living.

Georgia agreed that most’of
their training is just the con-
stant awareness that occurs
through practice and familiar-
ity. Her peeves were, “the con-
stant complaining about the
long line. . . .., they have no
idea of the breakfast seating
arrangement. . . ., and com-
plaining to me about the food—
which does absolutely no
good!"
