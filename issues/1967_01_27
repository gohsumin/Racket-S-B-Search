lldminisiratidn Will Request Funds For
$2 Million Physical Education Complex

By Jean Vandervoort

Tenative plans lor a two mil.

Facilities Commission of the
state of Iowa.

The physical education com-

over other needed lacilities such
as classroom renovation.

The building itself will
cost about $1,600,000; equip-

anticipate two large buildings,
one to house a swimming pool
and the other a gymnasium.
The two will be connected by
smaller buildings which will be

cover 83,463 square feel; this is
about three times as large as
Darby.

The college has applied for a
grant and a loan under Titles
of the Higher Education Act
which together would defray
75% of the cost. lowo‘s l-l. .

and sends it on to the Depart
inelit oi Health, Education and
Weiiare in Washington, D. c,
with its recomltteudaiiolls. AC-
cording to John A. Pittsch (phy—
icai education), the college
was encouraged to make ap-
plication before the January
31 closing date because oi the
amount of ltlllds now available.

Plans ior physical education
lacllities have been on the col-
lege’s building agenda since
1961. President Leggett says
that the building at the library,

fine arts building and forum
pushed aside the construction of
new “RE.” iacilities. Dr. Leg<
gett said he is continuing with
building according to the 1961
priority list.

The present swimming pool
was built its a temporary stnw
ture originally. Due to deteriorar
tion or the plumbing, it is ex-
pensive to maintain. The Wo<
men’s Gym has been structural-
ly unsound lor several years.

Secondly, the swimming pool
is located where a new women's
dorm would probably be built.
To make room for the dorm.
the pool must be relocated.

One View is that other needs
may be as pressing. Renovation
of ARl-l. Can-legie, and Goodnow
was also planned during Presi-
dent Bowen's administration.
But the college is more likely to
receive lederal funds for the
”p.e." complex than ior class.
room renovation, President Leg-
gett contends, because Grinnell
compares favorably with other
schools as far as classroom
space per student while its
“p. " facilities are worse than
those of other schools.

The physical education build—
ings will be adequate for a stu-
dent body three times as large
as the present one, according
to Ptitsch. President Leggett
says Grinnell does not anticapate
a radcial enrollment increase in
the near future. The question
had been raised as to the neces-
sity of such a large and costly
sports building lot a college the
size of Grinnell.

Several simpler proposals
were considered by the archi-
tects. One involved an addition
to Darby, but this presented
several problems. Building ex-
penses would be higher due to
:l water table at this site. Fur-
thermore, this area seems to be
the favored location for central
dining facilities, A “p.e." com-
plex here would crowd out din-
ing iaciliiies,

The proposed plan seems to
be more economical than many
other alternatives. Mr. Lambie,
business manager at the col-
lege, says that the complex
should be adequate loi‘ the lile
of the buildings, which will be
on or 70 years. The suggested
structiiie is probably more prac-
Iical than a structure which
would necessitate additions in
a relatively short. time.

Piitsch iavors the plans
on the grounds that they will
provide space [or iniormal re-
creation, aild they will augment
the present course offerings.

long winter during which the

Now, intercollegiate sports he

ing otters enough space for all

The Faculty Committee on
Student Alialrs will offer its
recommendation on the women’s
hours proposal this Monday,
January 30. The proposal calls
for the elimination of hours for
all women except iirst semester
ireshmen.

The Senate approved the pro-
posal last November 16. The
Faculty Committee was unable
to make the recommendation
within the 30 day limit because
of its involvement in the sus-

The committee met in closed

Dean low, AWS Board Define
Qualifications of New Advisers

By Paul Nachman

“We hope they will sup-
plement hall programs without
usnrping responsibilities from
established student government
structures,” noted AWS Board
President Karen Lauterbach a-
bout new resident advisors for
South Campus.

The resident adviser program,
slated to replace the existing
structure, was a topic of discus-
sion at the AWS Board’s Tues-
day meeting with Dean oi Wor
men Alice Low. Miss Lauterbach
indicated that few concrete
activities guidelines have been
set (or the advisors.

Dean Low and Miss Lauter-
bach agree that the new ad-
vlsors would best suit the Grin-
nell environment it they are
academically oriented. To this
end, the college is searching
among graduate schools nation-
wide {or qualllled candidate!
with masters’ degrees.

Dean Low described the role
oi the residents as twofold in
the non-academic sphere: coun-
selors on a personal level and
advisors lor social activities.
They will ease the load on the
individual hall presidents by
taking over many minor admin-
istrative duties. Dean Low
added that current responsibil~
ities sharply decrease the presi-
dents' study time, and they are
not qualified as counselors.

impending rules changes will
make the switch to resident
advisers more meaningful.

Existing resident advisor sys«
tems on North Campus have
proved of limited effectiveness.
"This is because they were
never given any guidance or

supposed to be doing in the

bach. “i hope we give the
residents more clearly defined

stressed, though, that some
ﬂexibility must be left in tho
system so that any difﬁculties
may be ironed out "in the

Miss Lauterbach emphasized
however, that their duties should
not extend into the ﬁeld of

She also admitted some dls<

young women to Gi'innell hes

Sex Education —

As Bob Weber of Iowa’s Planned Parenthood Association said
ring the best attended Interim coffee hour, “Sex is here to stay,"
hile this pronouncement is hardly a revelation, it is an un-

duestionabls fact which is too often ignored. An upcoming Sex Ed-
“cation Seminar, planned by Grinnell’s Sex Education Committee,
plans to deal with the subject of sex on a laudably realistic basis

The seminar will include lectures by University of Iowa Hos-
tal gynecologist Kerschmar and Iowa sociologist fra L. Reiss,
uthor of “Premarital Sex Standards in America." (Melinda Ward

reviews his book in this issue.) Kerschmar, experienced in discus-

ing the physiological aspects of sex‘ will include slides, basic in-
ormation and the medical philosophy of sex in his talk while
iteiss plans to deal with the psychosocial aspects of sex educa-
tion.

Besides the two professional lectures, the seminar will offer a
Grinneli faculty panel on ethical factors of sexuality, Optional dis-
uussion groups based on the lectures will be open to student partick
pants and will be led by student volunteers.

The Sex Education Committee, according to AWS Board presi-
dent Karen Lauterbach, “hopes to involve faculty members and
students in the seminar’s informal coffee hours and discussion
groups,” and is presently seeking participants for the faculty
panel and student discussion group leaders

If Grinnell Students display substantial support of the seminar,
there is a good chance it will be instituted as an annual event~ as
the committee hopes. A yearly sex seminar offering the latest ins
formation on all aspects of sexuality, like a similar extant Oberlin
seminar for freshmen, would be a valuable addition to the Grin-
nell education.

An achievement of which the Sex Education Committee and its
motivating force, Karen Lauterbach, can he justly proud, the im~
pending seminar proves that committees can accomplish ends.
t-lappily, there exists at Grinnell a viable mode of community re
sponse to student stimulus. Students have made obVlous their in-
terest in a sex education program by overflow attendance at Mr.
Crossett’s virginity monologue and the Interim coffee hour on pre-
marital sex. Coming at a time both opportune and 'cnicial with
respect to the probable elimination of women's hours, the seminar's
pragamatic emphasis will be a welcome, much needed change from
previous discussions exclusively moral approach —5. G.

Student Initiative —

The student Theater Board and the Grinnell Players are to be
commended for the active interest they have shown in extending
their own education in drama and related fields. They set up a
"Theatre Interim Seminar” in which several plays that the partici-
Eants had read were discussed. This semester the Board plans to

ave a series of “informal seminar type talks" led by faculty
members; those taking part include Professors Kissane, Nelson,
Foster, Farslow, Steiner, Crossett and others.

The Board, which for a while published its own ditto news-
paper, also has a program of movie discussmns; recently 23 stu-
dents saW “Morgan” at the Strand Theater and then held a “coffee
hour” to talk about it. will W.

Credit Due —

Last week we commended students for their efforts in pro-
ducing a successful Interim but further credit must go where
credit is due. Although students met with hesitancy on the part of
some members of the administration, we have been informed that
this skepticism was not universal.

President Glenn Leggett and Dean James Stauss helped make
Interim a reality by providing financial backing. They found
lufficient funds to keep the campus open for those extra days, to
pay maid and janitor salaries and to commission SAGA.

Dru Joseph Wall, Chairman of the Faculty, is also to be

thanked for aiding the students and helping to obtain support from
“Ihe faculty and administration. —K N.

Book Review

A Sociological Look at Sex

By Melinda Ward

“Premarital Sexual Standards in America”
by Ira L, Reiss, a sociologist at SUI, is a socio-
logical investigation of the relative social and cul»
tural integration of American standards. This
book, unlike many books being written on sex
today, deals with sexual standards rather than
behavior. Reiss feels that by studying standards
“one can see more fully Ihe role of society and
culture in sexual behavior.” In this review X will
at pt to convey the contents, rather than
or ze the methods and theories.

The book can be broken down into three
main sections, the first of which deals with
the sexual nature of man and America‘s sex-
uni heritage. Relss “established man‘s roots
in the animal klngdom" hy illustrating physh
illogical similarities of men and animals and
by giving examples of parallel muting habits
and characteristics. For instance, we find the
male-dominated family system among sen
elephants and the icmale moth is a recog-
nizahle Coquette.

Beyond these superficial similarities to our
customs, there is a major difference, that being
the concept of learned behavior, Although there
are biological and inherited aspects found
in all of man’s behavior, there is a
great deal of Variance to be found in differ-
ent societies concerning sexual standards for
men and women and social customs of courtship.
“in determining specific characteristics learning
is the dominant factor, and the inherited aspect
only a minor limitation.”

Reiss goes on to give examples of cultures
which do not. consider the male the aggressive
sex. For instance, “at a ceremonial dance the
Goajiro woman (on Bali) is permitted to trip a
man; and if she succeeds he is dutyrbound to
have intercourse with her.” Reiss also shows
us that our standards of sexual beauty are far
from universal. What appeals to men in one so-
ciety does not appeal to men in other societies ——
this is learned behaviorr Likewise there is no
universal standard concerning premarital and
extramarital intercourse ur homosexuality. In
light of this "learned behavior” theory, the con-
flict between “body and soul” can be dispensed
with and be better stated and understood in
terms of a conflict between “a learned desirable
way of satiating man’s partly physiological and
partly icamed sexual desires, on the one hand,
and his learned ideas about right and wrong, on
the other hand”

Following this introductory explanation, Reiss
discusses America’s sexual heritage; from what
cultures our present-day standards have come
and developed, For instance, the proverbial
double Standard is to be found in the divorce
laws and sexual morality oi the anClent Hebrews.
“Although abstinance was the formal standard
(both men and women were forbidden premari-
tal or extramarital coitus), informally the writ-

ten punishments and social censure was much
greater for the female than for the male.

In Greek civilization women who were
married stayed in the home and extramarital
sex was strictly forbidden However, men
were expected to have an extramarital sex
life. Demosthenes is quoted by Reiss. “Man
has the Hetaerae for erotic enjoyments, con-
cuhines for daily use and wives of equal rank -
Io bring up children and to be faithful house-
wives.” Homosexuality was also acceptable
for Greek men. Roman women had I few
more rights. They were allowed to appear in
public with their husbands. "The Romans
idealized their mothers and women in gen-
erni. To Insure virginity, the Romans taught
their women from birth to think If chastity
as the highest good."

Apparently the early Christians had a very low
regard for sexual relations and marriage based
on their belief in the Second Coming of Christ.
“The early Christians felt that marriage was a
second rate choice, but if one lacked self-con~
trol, he had to take a choice. 'It is better to
marry than burn'." The status of women bit the
lower depths under Christianity — woman were
the source of sin. However, “the woman who was
not a temptress could perform a respectable rule
in Christian societyr She was given the alterna-
tive of marriage or a nunnery." Women gained
a kind of equality in that abstinence was the for-
mal standard for both sexes. ”The Christian in-
fluence has given our culture an element of
gUilt associated with all sexual behavior outside
marriage. We still have this attribute to a con-
siderable degree at the present,”

The birth of Romantic Love in the 11th
century plays a large role in our sexual
standards today. “Out of the Christian de' 'a-
datlon of sex rose the romantic idealizatmn
of it. To the knights and troubadour, his
lady was an angel, in collection of perfec-
tion." In those days love and marriage did
not go hand in hand and for awhile it was
thought that to consummate love with sexual
intercourse Was to destroy it. This tradition
underwent many changes and finally the love
object became a single girl rather titan a
married lady of the court, love and marriage
were wedded, and parental right to choose a
mate was seriously challenged.

The final influence that Reiss cites is that of
the feminist revolt which came along with the
industrial revolution. After 1848, women began
to go to college, earn their own living, and be-
came freer sexually, all of which began to weak-
en the traditional standard considerably. With
the industrial revolution the tight-knit family of
an agrarian society began to disappear and
cities provided a place for divirgent ideas and
anonymity. In the twentieth century We have
had more rapid change than ever before. In next
week’s article i will talk of Reiss’ analysis of
today‘s sexual standards and of the behavior and
consequences that are a result of the complex
and conflicting standards of modern America,

The time has come to estab-
lish the student revolt at Grin-

Sanctiilionieus domination of

can no longer be tolerated by
responsible students. Tile lii'iioV
Cris) of an administrative agen-
cy that speaks with one tongue
about conciliation and mean»
iligtiil negotiation and with
another tongue about the (tiles
tion of “\ihetlici‘ open dorms
should exist 3L all.” can no
longer be acceptcd as a neces-
sary evil. Student frccdom can
no longer be sacrificed to main-
tain "good relations with the
deans," or “the good name of
the college." The urgency at a
revitalization of student aware-
ness and concern for the state
of the entire college environ-
ment cannot be over-estimated.

We can no longer depend on
the good faith of the adminis-
[ration oi' the compassion of
the faculty to solve what is es-
sentially a student concern.
Agents of reaction who suggest
that revolt is immoral because
of an implicit social contract
neglect the nature of the proli-
lems that confront the Grinnell
student. The promises in the
catalog of a “closely knit come
mullity," “self-government,"
and “education considered as
an organic whole” have not
been realized, and the attitudes
that serve to stiﬂe these oh~
Jectives can no longer be toler-
ated by responr‘ ile students of

Those who see the Consequenc-
es of the present course have
two alternatives, The ﬁrst is
disengagement from the prob»
lems of the college. This abdi-
cation or responsibility appears
to be the most common reselli-
tion at the dilenina that we
face. The second alt .Jative is
Io “work inside i. change."
This no longer means a trite
plea tor student involvement.
Rather, it is the call to radical
revolt — a campaign against
the suppr 1 of our some
and intellectual life,

The apparent acceptance by
the administration, and passive
acceptance by the iaculty, of
Grinnell as a second-rate iris-
titution, imposes the burden o1
change upon the students.

ask that these changes be seen
in the light of the demands of
a newly evolving society and
the aims of liberal education.

submitted to the university
president tlor approval.)

The basic premise on which
our recommendation is based
is that a resident University
such as Stanford should try
to provide optimum living con.
ditions for those of its students
who choose or are required to
live on campus. Dorm residents,
especially those required to
live in dorms, should have free.
dom to choose, individually and
collectively, how housing facili-
ties will be used. We do not, of
course, mean to suggest that
each student can or should be
given absolute freedom to de
termine how he or she will live
in a University residence. Some
regulations are obviously neces
sary in the interests of health,
safety, sanitation, the protection
of property and tile mainten-
ance of pleasant living and stir-
dy conditions.

Every restriction on a stir»
dent's use of his own room

SCARLET AND SLACK

ought to have an affirmative
justification besides the fact
that it is traditional. Further,
limitations on use should be de-
termined by dorm residents
rather than hv University rogue
lations.

in our view, the underlying
matter of principle involved in
the open house issue has alrca-
dy been do a by the Uni-
versity. Visitor of the opposite
sex are now permitted to be in
tlle rooms of Stanford students
for substantial periods of‘time
each week. Consequently we
have not debated the accent»
ability of open house as a mat-
ter ot principle, but instead
have concentrated on two prag-
matic questions:

1, Should the number of
permissible open house
hours each week be expand.
ed if the students so da-
sire?

2. Who should decide if
and to what extent open
house hours should be eit-
pandedi

Our answer is that, subject
to certain limitations discussed
below, open house hours should
be those Which are agreed up-
on by the students in each resi-

dence, except for freshmen
G

residences during the autumn
quarter, to set their own open
house hours. provided that an
open house would not be per
mittcd to last beyond 2:30 am.
or begin betore 10:00 am.

We do not believe, on the
basis of the evidence that has
been presented to us, that most
residences will in fact set open
house hours at or even near
the maximum which our pm-
posed regulations would permit.
We propose a “basic" open
house regulation, to prevail in
the absence of affirmative ace
tioii by the students concerned.
The “basic” regulation would
permit open house tour days
a week from noon to midnight.

in reaching our conclusions,
we have carefully considered
the argument that open houses
inconvenience a o m a stu-
dents. We rcilize that wlnlc
there is widespread student
support for expanded open
house hours, there may be some
students who will feel that the
privacy and informality of their
residence will be impaired by a
more liberal open house policy,
The problem of balancing these
competing interests is a delicate
and difficult one, but it seems
clear to us that they must be
balanced rather than he re-
solved wholly one way or the
other.

We have concluded that the
most practical and educational.
ly desirable way to strike the
necessary accommodation is tor
the students in each residence
to balance the various coinpct
ing interests themselves, pro-
vided only that minority Iter-
csts are adequately cor ’dered
and protected. With reference
to roommates, this is justly one
of many questions which they
inust resolve in mutually ac-
ceptable ways.

We realize that not everyone
agrees that inconvenience and
privacy are the only relevant

considerations in determining
open house limitations, For
some it central concern to
whether a more liberal open
house policy will encourage sort-
ual relationships among std
dents. We think this false issue
is exaggerated. students deny
ﬂint they seek more liberal
open house hours for such pur
poses, and comment that a Unl-
versity residence is not an ideal
or even a likely place for sexual
relationships.

in recommending modified
open house regulations, we ex-
pect that living conditions for
those students who choose or
are required to live on campus
will be improved. We make
this recommendation in the ex-
pectation that Stanford stu-
dents will oomply with the pro-
ccc-rai requirements recom-
mended, will respect the rights,
preferences and sensitivities of
all students involved, and will
observe and support the en-
forcement of the limitations on
open house hours which would
be established by or under—
the proposed regulations,
Should our proposal be adopted
and these expectations not be
realized, the matter of open
house policy should than, in
our opinion, be immediately re-
considered.

Howard Motfett. Vietnam War Correspondent.
Writes First Article of War Evaluation Series

By Howard Moltetl
The Collegiate Press Service

15]). NOTE: Howard Mol-
lett, 1965-66 editor at the Yale
Daily News, has, for several
months, been a full-time cor-
respondent in South Vietnam
for the Collegiate Press Serv-
ice. This article is a compila-
tion or his early impressions.
His report will appear period-
Ically in the 5&3.

SAlGON (CPS) — Last year

since that a just war is a con

on one thing: nothing here is
that simple, nothing is that
black»and-white.

Those who talk about Viet-
nam in these terms, and on the
other hand those who mouth
cliches about defending democ<

racy and treedom against Com-
munist aggression, have re-
duced one of the most compli-
cated and agonizing situations
in modern history to shihbo»
leths. Worse, they have suc-
ceeded in making these Shib-
boleths virtually the only terms
of the public debate on Web
nam.

There is a struggle going on
in South Vietnam between two
groups of people, each of them
numbering several million.
Two separate societies coexist
within the same national boun«
daries. Each is trying to or-
ganize, strengthen and sank
tion itself while weakening or
destroying the other.

year ago piles of garbage lay

The Pioneer varsity wrestling
team opened their season in a
convincing manner by winning
three dual meets last weekend—

lower and upper weights. The
two smallest Pioneers got the
team off to an early lead as
Mike Martinson picked up a
tnrteit and Roger Cluw won 50.
Alter a loss at 137, both John
Sharpe and Bob Van Wyck tied

their opponents Then Law-
rence picked up three straight
wins. But Lou Kelly reversed
the trend with an impressive
16-0 win at 177; Don Kraitsik
then pinned his man at 191, and
Bob Geller finished the match.
with a 4-1 win.

In tho Ripon meet, which the
Pioneers won 25-16, the four
final wrestlers again pulled out
the victory.

The Pioneers had a breather
against Beloit as they picked up
five forfeits, three pins, two win
and last only one match in the
46-3 romp, The winners were
Ray Mendel and Kraitslk and
plnners were Sharpe, John Lov-
enthal, and Store.

this weekend off and then will

ball games, chalked up their
eighteenth, nineteenth, and
twentieth consecutive losses as
St. Olaf, Carleton and Cornell

victoriesr

Last Friday night an in
spired St. Olaf team came to
Grinnell and put the game be-
yond reach in just a couple of
minutes Jumping off to a 194
lead, they substituted freely
throughout the game and never
let the Pioneers start any kind
of offensive, The conference's

hit 12-18 from the floor and
led St. Olaf with 25 points,
Lending the Pioneers was Mike
Schwartz, with 20.

The script was changed the
next night as Carleton came in
to entertain the Pioneers. Al-
though the Carls led most of
the way, they never got far into
the lead and the Pioneers were
ahead late in the game until
big Clark Marshall made a bas-
ket with about ten seconds to
go to win the game 77-76,

Tuesday night the Pioneers
entertained Cornell and threw
a mighty scare into the second-
place Rams. shooting a blister-
