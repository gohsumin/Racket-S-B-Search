Grinnell Grad Thompson New Dean M Men

 

Spring stayed away just long enough to ruin many
Spring Day plans. It arrived last week-end in full
force to usher in two hectio weeks of term papers,
exams, and comprehensives. But despite pressures,
many students have moved their ”library” and type-
writers too out onto the campus grounds.

N. S. A. Will Remain in Operation;
Senaie Passes Plan By One Vote

By Wade Stevenson

The student Senate voted 18'
to 17 Wednesday night to con»-
tinue paying $275 a year for
Grinnell’s affiliation with the
National Student Association

Marilyn Alt began debate on
the question of disaffiliation of
N. S, A. by saying that “I
haven’t seen the positive effects
of N. S. A. on the Grinnell Cam-
pus. I have voted for it for
three years, but I no longer see
that N: S. A. has a place on the
campus.”

Phil Johnson, S. G. A. Pres-
ident, argued in favor of the
national organization. He asked
“what are you going to replace
N. S. A. with? N. S. A. works
in the area of academic free-
dom, in the civil rights move-
ment, and if we leave N. S. A.,
we would have 'no role in mak-
ing our Voice known in national
student affairs? Johnson also
pointed out that N, s. A. was
considered to be representative
of student views and that mem-
bers of N. S. A. testified before
congressional committees and
other agencies of the U. S. gov<
ernment.

Jack Chapman, former S. G.
‘A. President, said that ”Mr.
Johnson overstate: the impact
of N. S. Ai’s statements before
congressional c o m m ittees.”
Chapman indicated that N. S. A.
was only a small voice on a
long list of testimony heard by
t h e s e committees. Chapman

‘Art and Eros’ Sunday

Regular Sunday services will
be held in Herrick Chapel this
Sunday at 11:30 a.m, The ser-
mon, entitled “Art and Eros”
will be given by Dr. Howard
Burkie.

 

[noted that “it is important that

Grinnell students play a. role in
national affairs, but it is not
necessary to belong to N. S. A,
to play this role.”

The debate raged on with
Evans, Patrick, and Weyrauch
speaking against N. S. A. and
Herzog, Heilhron, and Brue d§~
fending the organization. Final-
ly, the vote was tallied. N. S. A.
remains.

Because of the concern of the
Curriculum Committee over the
fact that Grinnell does not
h a v e, a clinical psychologist,
Stephen B. Wood, dean of men,
clarified the situation for the
senate. Dean Wood noted that
“Grinnell is spending more
than five times the amount of
any other college in the A. C.M.
on services to students who
have problems." Dean Wood
also indicated that a clinical
psychologist is not able to diag-
nose all the cases which con.
front him, and that only an en-
tire staff of trained men would
be adequate in meeting the
problems. Such a staff would
involve too large an expendi~
ture of money.

Dean Wood said that he
wanted to make it understood
that “the college is spending its
resources in this area and that
Grinnell has contributed to the
Jasper County Clinic. “This
clinic will provide psychologia
cal services to Grinnell stu-
dents. The senate decided to
gather more information be-
fore making a decision in this
area.

Jim Parkison, Speaker of the
Senate, announced that in a
meeting with James Stauss.

‘ously taught high

By John Wolf

S. Eugene Thompson, a 1953
graduate of Grinnell, has been
appointed to the position of
Dean of Men, President How-
ard R. Bowen announced this
week.

Thompson, who will assume
his new post in September, is

‘presently a high school teacher

in Shorewood. Wis. He previ-
school in
received his
from the

He
Degree

Iowa City.
Master’s

‘State University of Iowa in

1960.
While at Grinnell. Thompson

, was a columnist for the see,

a member of the radio station,
and a member of Sigma Delta
Chi. He was also active in
drama, forensics, men’s gov-
ernment, and campus goverm
ment. He majored in English.

 

Thompson is married and has
two sons. His wife, the former
Elma Johnston, is also a Grin-
nell graduate. She majored in
music and elementary educa-
tion.

“Mr, Thompson is a young
and vigorous person," noted
President Bowen. “He has a
deep interest in the college and
in working with men. I think he
will prove to be an outstand-
ing dean of men.”

As a member of the 5&1},
Thompson wrote a weekly col<
umn. Below is a sampling of
his column.

September 1957: "Strange as
it may seem, there are still
some people who refuse to be-
lieve the old and peculiarly
American lie that one must
JOIN to be successful. Some of
the world’s greatest men have

 

been quite horrible neurotics,
misanthropes, go- -it aloners, and
social rebels. And some of
them have even been happy at
the same time.”

January 1958: ‘I’m convinced
that this campus needs more
satire, more intelligent hell-
raising, more cussing and lil-
bel, and more dissatisfaction
in student affairs. We could
never find half as many things
in administration and faculty to
object to as we could easily
find among ourselves, if we,
looked."

May 1957: “Grim-tell, like any
other institution, is made of the
people who attend it and attend
to it. It’s regarded as one of
the best because its people are
some of the best. a fact which
never fails to make me think
of green pastures and sum
shine.”

In his final chapel appearance as President of the col-
lege, Dr. Bowen illustrated that he has not abandoned for
Grinnell those high ideals which he believes can make the
college finer. During his years here, President Bowen has
held the notion of the independent learner in a free society
paramount. In his Game of Numbers, Revisited on May 8,
he presented additional proposals offered in the Game of
Numbers two years ago.

Most important to the student in these proposals is the
attempt to eliminate pressure without decreasing the quality
of education. The comprehensive exams, both on liberal arts'
and in the major field, would take on greater importance,
blit preparation would be more concentrated toward this
end. The liberal arts exam would be given to sophomores”
or accellerated freshmen, when the student had finished hisi
preliminary liberal arts courses. The interim session, asi
such, would be abolished, and the time put to better use:
during the whole of the semester. After passing the iiberall
arts exam, the student would be prepared to enter completely
into study in his major field. The comprehensives, under
this system, would be more carefully planned, more consci-
entiously prepared for, and of greater value to the student
and his record.

Especially designed for eliminating pressure is the pro
posed revisal in the grading system. The rigid A, B, C, D, F,
categories which often cause the student to seek out easier
courses or professors for the sake of jacking up the grade-
point, or wllich discriminate heavily against the borderline
student would give way to a high pass, pass, and fall system.
The wider boundaries would most certainly take away some
of the fine lines that honor societies and grade schools ap-
preciate, but it would give greater opportunity for students
who clutch the gradepoint ladder to engage in something
other than “self-service."

The independence in learning is most avidly supported
by Dr. Bowen in his view toward a modified tutorial system
in which students would be engaged with faculty tutors dur-
ing their college year on a regular and extensive basis. Inde-
pendent accomplishment would be measured and directed

y the faculty tutor. Immediate student concern with this
proposal was that such a system be definitely improved from
the freshman advisor system now in operation. It would
take a competent and active faculty to provide the number
of qualified, interested tutors needed. The heavy responsi-
bility here would be in choosing the tutors for each student
and for allowing for flexible change within the choices should
students become dissatisfied with the tutors chosen.

It would most likely be necessary, as the President has
suggested, to have two major groups of tutors, one for fresh-
men and sophomores, concentrated in the liberal arts, and
one for juniors and seniors after they have selected their
major field.

Although a great deal has been said about the Game of
Numbers during the last two years, the same old contest
is still being played here semester after semester. Every-
one seems aware of pressures on the students and of the
inability of the present course-faculty system to take on any
real movement toward student academic freedom. The interim
period has only been a frustrated attempt to accomplish in
two weeks what necessarily demands four years. Students
agree with Dr. Bowen’s ideals, but wonder just when action
can be or will be taken. Are they going to be removed from
our sphere when the President moves on, remaining in the
office files, and in the old copies of the S If; B as only “well-
sald thoughts?” LD

Letters to the Editor
Loss of Library Books May Cause “Distasteful” System

To the Editor:

The quality of students at
Grinnell allows for many priv-
ileges and freedoms in the
course of our college educa-
tion. Both professors and ad-
ministrutors frequently employ
an honor system in regard to

academic and social policies,
In the past few years there has
been one area of student of—
fairs in which this system has
failed miserably. Library in-
ventories reveal that. more
than 800 books disappear from
Hurling Library each year.

 

Rattner Finds New Art Form—
His Modernistic Pretzel-Bike

To the Editor:

As a graduating Art student
so engrossed in his major field
of study, I make no pretense to
any literary talents, much less,
as yet, to an accomplished pro-
ficiency in any of the other
areas. But I must speak With a
certain Pride and conviction
when relating a recent dlSCOVv
cry, for venturing, the other
day, beyond my usual sur-
roundings, i believe I finally
came upon a piece of true un-
diluted creation; Yes, an art
form that hurl been conceived
with such force and emotion
that it. seemed to surpass even
the wildest dreams of human
capability.

glow of an Iowa sunset, my

Member of Old Guard
Fires Up Over Apathy

To the Editor:

Let me prelac’e this letter
with the statement that I am
part of the “old firedrup guard"
and not a part of the "new
guard."

As of late there has been
much talk of an increase in so-
cial fees. And 1 should like to
reply, ”Why increase them?”
My proposal would be to re-
duce the social fees to naught.
After all, dOESn't the majority
rule? And our majority does
not attend the excellent social
events provided.

I should also suggest that
Spring Day be dropped because
it. Is evident that it is an un-
necessary nuisance for the stu-
dents. By why, you say. The
picnics were well attended.
Yes, nature has a great power
over hungry Grinnellians. What
about the other e v e n ts?
“They’re a farce." . . . . “and
that awful weather.” Lous-
ey, worthless excuses.

My suggestion is that we
abolish all social functions and
create the strict academic at-
mosphere that the “new guard"
seems to Want. Let’s have Burl-
ing remain open until 12 mid-
night Saturday nights, to get in
step with the "new guard.”
The Forum shall replace the
temporary Union and shall only
be used for intellectual dee
bates and discussions. Down
with I. Mrs. We only have time
for books.

Ahhhhhllhhhl The “n e w
guard”! How we will pride our-
selves on our perfect academ-
ic atmosphere and our number
of mental crack-ups.

Considering the fact that the
cost of cataloguing a book usuv
ally equals its purchase price,
the annual financial loss to the
school approaches 38000. In ad
dition to this financial loss, the
scale disappearance of book;
indicates a disregard for pro-
fessors who must plan their
courses and for other student:
who must complete their re-
quired work.

Faculty concern over this
problem has resulted in exten-
sive study by the Faculty Li-
brary Committee, Several solu-
tions have been presented, few
of which are complimentary to
either the Faculty Committee's
or student leader’s conceptions
of student responsibility, Wheth-
er unintentional or purposelul,
the permanent removal of books
from the library cannot be tol-
erated.

Perhaps the students are not
completely aware of current
library policies. For instance,
a book may be checked out i -
definitely it it is not in immedi-
ate demand. There seems little
cause for books to disappear in
the process of completing as-
signed work.

Beginning Friday, May 22
and continuing until May 31
there will be boxes placed in
the dormitories for the pur-
pose of Collecting “borrowed"
library books. We hope that
students Wlll realize the gravity
of the present problem, return
any books which they have not
checked out, and utilize the li-
brary’s present Checkrout pro<
cedure.

It the students act now there
will be no need for the intro—
duction of a system which
would be distasteful to stu-
dents and faculty alike.

[0119- Campus Shifts in Emphasis

from Herrick to Burling libr ry

By Susan Taylor

“I think the way in which the _ ..

college sees itself has changed,"
Dr. Winston L. King, Rand Pro«

fessur of Applied Christianity
and Roberts Honor Professor

for 1963-64, said when asked _

about the’changes he has ob-

served in Grinnell over his fif» ‘

teen-year teaching career here.
“There was a stronger tenden-
oy when 1 first came in 1949 to

think of Grinnell as a church~ ‘

related college,” he said.
"There was more of a religious
context.”

King, who will be leaving
Gl’lnnell to assume teaching
duties at Vanderbilt University,
Nashville, Tennessee, in the
fall, came to Grinnell in the
194950 school year to assume
the position of Dean of the
Chapelea position
held until this year when he was
relieved of his pastoral duties
to devote more time to teach»
ing and writing.

Explaining the combination
of the religious and the academ-
it; in the very nature of the po-
sitlon of Dean of the Chapel,
King commented that he was
intrigued by the mixing of these
two areas. As the position itself
has changed over the years,
with increasing emphasis on
the academic, King also has
noticed a similar change in the
nature of the college.

Grinnell has evolved from a
Christian Liberal Arts College
to a Liberal Arts College; he
said. "I really don’t know What
Grinnell thinks it is now."

King explained that the insti-
tutional expressions of religion
mean less to this student gen-
eration than to Grinnell stu-

Dutstamling cadets

Honored at Dinner

On May 13, the 255th Air
Force ROTC Cadet Squadron of
Grinnell held a Military Din-
Ing-ln at the Ronneburg Inn,
Amana Colonies. Guest speaker
for the event was Major Bob
Ray USAF (R). One purpose of
the dining-in was to present
yarious awards to the outstand<
ing cadets of the past year.

The Grinnell College Military
Medal was presented to Cadets
Nordahl L. Brue (Bronze med-
al), John J. Pojman (Silver).
and Lawrence R. Rinderknecht,
for being the most outstanding
cadets militarily in their re-
spective classes.

Cadets Richard S. Schoen-
Ieldt, Robert C. Mack, and
Stephen D. Rockwood received
the Bronze, Silver, and Gold
Reserve Officers' Association
Medal, respectively, while the
General Dynamics Air Force
ROTC Cadet Award went to
Cadet John E. Kelsey.

The Cadet Commander's
Commendation Ribbon was
awarded to Cadet Lawrence R.
Riliderknecht, and Cadet Jeri
M. Langham received the Ex-
emplary Perlorlllance Ribbon.

dents in '49-’50. Most students
do have nominal church connec-
tions, he said, but he noted a
“change in o’he religious cli-
mate from institutional to
something else.”

“Students today are much
more concerned about the areas
of social justice,” King said.
The early fifties were more
placid, ”I notice increasing
concern on the part of students
in the areas of politics, integra-
tion, and specific social con‘
cerns,” he commented. He saw
the student body as ”much
more alive now than it was
then” in these areas. “This so-
cial concern has become a mor-
al equivalent for religion," he
said.

King saw “not a true irrell-
giousity. but a shifting into oth<
er channels.” He said there is
a “good bit of unstructured,
non—institutionalized religious
interest and concern." Students
are facing basic questions such
as the meaning of life and mor-
als, and of what personal re-
lationships should be.

”This indicates a greater
moral sensitivity on the part of

students,” he said. Explaining,

that this sensitivity is “spot-
ty" in that students can become
very concerned about the
meaning of life and yet Still
steal $7,000 worth of library
books annually, King said this
indicated a ”strange unconcern
about other people." ‘
Other changes in the campus
noted by King included an in-
crease in‘ cultural programs.
This, he said, gives the reli-
gious programming more com-
petition, because it cannot as<
sume an open field. There has
also been a shift in the signifi-
cance and the status of the
Board of Religion, according to
Dr. King. “In the early years

 

that I was here, it had a great

 

SCARLET AND BLACK

hell during the past years

* * it

deal of prestige, many went on
from the presidency of the
Board to the presidenCy of the
Student Council.“

King also noted a “more
highly professionalized attitude
on the part of the Grinnell Fac-
ulty" in the last fifteen years.
There has become an emphasis
on “proficiency in one's special-
ty,” he said. This leads to a
tension with the traditional Con-
cept of liberal arts education.

Grinnell, he said, has also be»
come somewhat less of an Iowa
college. There are more stu-
dents from the Eastern sea-
board communities. Also more
students from Grinnell are go-
ing on to graduate school.

Grinnell has always had a
great “esprit de corps" accord-
ing to Dr. King. However, he
commented that perhaps this
sense of community has not
been associated with the col-
lege, yet a significant amount
of it still remains, though faced

Maybe the college could solve
the problem it apparently is
having in attracting and main-
taining the highest quality fac-
ulty members, which it so ob-
viously needs for its brilliant
student body, by diverting some
of the money spent for poorly
attended lectures. A college
can be only as good as its fac<

given to the essentials rather
than the extras of education.

looking somewhat like fish-

unpleasant question: What if
the extensive use of glass is the

psychology department which
is carrying out some sort of
dastardly experiment on the
Grinnell student body?

Anku on Ghana's OnerParty Rule

By Vincent Anku

By a resounding majority in
I referendum a few months ago,
the people of Ghana adopted
the OnerParty System of (from
ernment. Immediately some
sectors of American press
aharged Nkrumah with elimi-
nating the last vestiges of de-
mocracy in Ghana. They hast-
ﬂy labeled the whole referen-
iium e hoax. I think both accu-
Iations are unfounded. -

The revered American Presi-
ilent Lincoln imprisoned his op-

nents at an army camp in

e 1864 election. Does one con.
clude that the whole 1864 Pres-
Idential election was a farce?
Ihis reference is no attempt on
my part ‘to justify the flaws in
Ghana‘s referendum, but sim-
ply to substantiate my asser-
tions. 1 am painfully conscious
of some glaring inconsistencies
In the voting procedures. Some
lazy and negligent civil servants
are to blame, not Nkrumah.
However, it is erroneous to stig-
matize the whole referendum
as a farce. No wonder the
Ghana press retorted that the
monstrous and unpleasant ru-
mors about the referendum
were definitely fornented by evil
neocolonists in Ghana. ‘For
there is no doubt that at least
80% of the voters are already
[yoluntary members of Nkru-
mah's party. A few days after
to the referendum, the Febru-
ary 2 issue of the Des Moines
Register made this remark:

“Nkrumah is still an ex-
Iz'emely popular leader and
there is little doubt that his
party would win any referen-
‘dum it cared to back.”

How any sensible person can
make such a statement and at
the same time claim that the
yoters were all compelled to
yote ”yes” ls hard to under-
nand.

To give an example which
may indicate that the results
of the referendum was a gen—
uine majority decision, I quote
a Nigerian radio commentator
January 4, 1964:

“There is so far no evidence
that President Nkrumah is not
a majority ruler in Ghana. In
fact, few African leaders com-
mand the level of spontaneous
response and sincere support

 

President Nkrumah gets from
the masses of Ghana.”
Ghanaians, who are proud of
their efficient democratic sys»
tem, believe that the essence of
democracy, which may take
different forms, is majority
rule. One may then be tempted
to absolve Nkrumah from
blame and charge Ghana with
tyranny of the masses. As I
had observed in an earlier
article tyranny of the masses
is an inherent feature of all
democratic processes.

Is the One-Party State desir-
able in Ghana? Absolutely Yes.
Below are citations from a
leading British and an Ameri-
can journal which corroborate
my stand.

cedures known in Northwestern
Europe offer no substitute for
‘strong government’ during
the transitional period after in—

“But even if one understands
why single-party rule is inevit-
able under present circum-
stances, that is not reason for
believing that democracy has
no future in Africa. There was
a time when democracy had no

My readers may recall that
the United States had only one
party for the first eight years
after her Independence. Even
as late as 1820 James Monroe
was elected President without
any opposition. The absence of
opposition is not unusual in
young countries. Ghana is not
the first one-party state in Af-

be the last, since unity is ab-

Six Mefusequoius
Thrive on Campus

Six Metasequoia trees, dis-
tant relatives of the California
sequoias, have survived their
first winter on the Grinnell
campus, Ben Graham (biol.)
has announced.

The Metasequoia,‘aiso known
as dawn redwood, was known
only from fossil remains until
1941 when living specimens
were discovered in China dur-
ing explorations for natural me
I o u r a a s in underdeveloped
areas during the Japanese in-
vasion of the mainland.

Since 1948 the tree has spread
to many other parts of the
world. Graham believes that
the several specimens in the
Grinnell area represent the
only outdoor planting of Met-
asequoia in Iowa.

The trees were planted last
spring. There are three west
of the swimming pool and three
south of the fine arts center.

Graham explained that while
the tree is a conifer, it is also
deciduous, losing its leaves in
the winter. Graham noted that
the Grinnell specimens have
begun putting out new needles
this spring,

The Metasequoia is related to
the cyprus of southeastern Unit-
ed States and'less closely re-
lated to the California red-
wood. Metasequoia originated
in the late Cretaceous, more
than 60 million years ago.

Grinnell has other examples
of “living fossils” in male and
female ginkgo trees near the
fine arts center. Believed to
have been extinct, the ginkgo
was also discovered in China.

P oneers Win Track Title; Set Three Records

By Pete Kollman

The Pioneer cindernien closed
their regular season with a
convincing show of power, win-
ning the Midwest Conference
track meet held last weekend
in Cedar Rapids by 30 points
over their nearest competitor,
Cornelli Grinnell rolled up 65‘
points, beating last year’s sum
of GI; Cornell followed with 35:
and the other eight conference
schools were bunched between
Monmouth’a 23 points and Law-
rence’s nine. Not only was the
Pioneer point total impressive
but two conference and one
school record were broken
along with many personal highs
of individual Grinnell track-
men,

In the sprints, Ron Schachel
ied Grinnell. After running a
9.8 personal high in the prelim-
inaries of the 100 yard dash and
finishing third with a 10.1 in the
finals, Schachel copped the
220 title in 22.5 seconds.

Bruce Beckord set a new
school and conference record
in the quarter, zooming
around the Kingston Stadium
oval in 48.1 seconds. He was
followed by John TePaske,
whose 49.7 effort was a per—
sonal high.

Jeri Langham was the only
double winner of the meet, tak-
ing the half-mile in 1255.7 and
the mile in 4:22.41. TePaske‘fol-
lowed him in the half With the
best time of his career, 156.6,
and Rod Brown finished fourth
In the mile with a time of 4:23”,

Other individual places in
running event: Paul Patter
son’s 9:464 in the two mile, a
personal high, earned him sec-
ond in the event; Brown’s 53:55.2
in the two mile, was good for
fourth place; and Mike Dewitt
took a fourth place with a hur-
dle effort of 24.8.

The Pioneer mile relay team,
with individual clockings of:
Schachei—49.9, Langham—5l-
‘1, TePaske—49.9 and Beckord
~48], set a new conference
record of 3:20.11.

,Pioneers 2nd Again in MCAC Golf Meet;
Sellergren Paces Pioneers; Shoots 143

By Andy Bushnell

The Grinnell varsity golf
team ended the 1964 season fin-
ishing second in the conference
meet for the second consecu-
tive year. Defending champion
Knox again took top honors,
outshooting the Pioneers by
twelve strokes 584-596.

The meet, which was held
last Friday and Saturday at
the Elmorest Country Club in
Cedar Rapids, capped a sum
cessful season during which the
Pioneers compiled'a 7—1 record
in dual matches and finished

second in the Drake Invitation-

al Tournament.

Cornell, the only team to beat
Grinnell all season in dual play,
ended on eighteen game Pio-

neer winning streak which ex—
tended back to I962. Ironically,
Cornell was also the last team
to beat the Pioneers in 1962.

Pete Boynton fired a 69 on
the opening day of the con»
ference meet and added a 72 on
Saturday to pace Knox and win
medalist honors With a 141 for
36 holes. Larry Hund, also of
Knox, finished third with a 144.

The Pioneers were paced by
Dave Sellergren who shot a
143, the second best individual
performance, and Ted Risser
who came back with a 69 on
Saturday after a first round 77,
giving him a 146 total. Rick
Miller and Mike Miller turned
in scores of 150 and 157 respec-
tively for the 596 total.

In conference Meet

By Don Kurasch

The Pioneer racqueteers
failed to place anyone in the
Midwest Conference meet fi-
nals last weekend, finishing in
I file for fifth with Knox. This
was Grinnell’s lowest finish in
recent tournaments.

Third seeded Larry Shannon.
playing in the number one sin-
gles spot, lost to Ripon’s all-
amund athlete, J ack Ankerson,
6-4, 6-4, in the semi-finals. Mike
Greenfield, seeded first in the
number three position, lost in
the second round. Bob Kornfeld
and Ken Clymer, playing num-
ber four and number two re-
Ipectively. failed to advance.

In doubles action, Shannon
and Kornleld got through a
preliminary round, but lost in
their next match. At number
two doubles, third seeded
Clymer and Greenfield lost
their opening match.

One note of consolation, how-

ever, is that Coach Bowers’
team is young. All the varsity
lettermen will be returning,
and a large crop of freshmen

Carleloli’s hitters came to life
last Saturday when the Carls

Knox, the pennant winner in

hurler, took the loss.

Carleton rebounded in grand

By Don Kurasch

The McMurray Trophy has
been won, and all the Animals
are locked in their cages study—
ing for finals. The winner hadn’t
been decided until one of the
last softball duals of the season,
an exciting game last Monday
when the men of Smith con-
quered the men of Clark 10-!)
in 10 innings.

The climactic finish was a
fitting tribute to one John C.
Truesdale, who this year com-
plates his 37th and final year at
Grinnelll Dr. Truesdale, Pete
Staben, and all the other 1M
officials were responsible for
this past 1963-64 IM yearian-
other very successful year.

It was a year very much
dominated by the two top con»
tenders for the IM crown,
Smith and Clark. At the end of
the football season, the three
spots were won by Clark. Dib-
ble, and Gates. ln Tennis it
was Clark, Langan. and Smith.
Langan, Smith and North dom-
inated Volleyball. 1273 in Swim-
n'ling went to Langan, Smith,
and North. Basketball’s high
places went to West, Smith,
and South. Track was com-
pletely dominated by Clark,
followed way behind by Sv 'th
and South. In Bowling it was
Dibble. Rawson and Clark.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

At this point in the year,
there were two sports left to bo

Smith, without having won a
first place in any sport, domi—
hated the Animal heap with'
2120 points. Their only threat
was Clark, very close with
2000 points.

When the Golf results were
in, Clark, East, and Dibbln
had won. Now. softball would
be the deciding sport. Assum-
ing Dibble beat West in a make-
up game yesterday, they won
the sport, with East, Smith,
and Rawson in a 3~way tie for
second. In any case, Smith has
captured the McMurray Tro-
Phy.

Chicago Daily News (IolumnislL Addresses Grinnell
0n Difficulties. Rewards of Newspaper Profession

| By Ann Showalter

"The purpose of my column
Is to make people think," as-
serted Sydney J. Harris at the
Sigma Delta Chi and Theta Sig<
ma Phi spring dinner and Mat-
rix Table last Thursday.

Writer of the daily column,
“Strictly Personal” for the
Chicago Daily News and the
Publishers Newspapers Syndi-
cate, Harris spoke on the per-
ils of a columnist with the
above goal. ,

The first peril is no one really
believes in the freedom of the
press. “You believe in freedom
lip to the point at which the
writer stops pointing his finger
at your neighbor and starts
pointing it at you,” he charged.

He explained that me column-
Ist often becomes cynical be-
cause his critics seem ‘inde-
fatiguable in writing long and
semirliterate letters to the edi-
bor' while no one writean to
praise a column.

Publicity seekers pose a
threat to the columnist
"Countless individuals, craving
the heavy wine of notoriety,
will resort to any method to
get their names in print Some
will even settle for an unfavor-
able mention.”

Besides those looking for per-
lonal fame, there are the pew
.ple with a mission. The journal»
ist is forced to spend many
hours a week listening to these
“save-theworlders."

“Friendship,” H a rris an
nounced, “is the most danger-
ous pitfall of any newspaper-
man and perhaps of any man"

When a journalist starts liv-
lng with the people he is trying
to write about, corruption be-
gins to set in. “The columnist
relinquishes his professional
Virginity; he becomes a lap dog
instead of a watch dog"

The columnist must avoid
taking himself too seriously—
confusing himself with God
“The good columnist always

 

‘k ‘k *

keeps in mind the possibility
that he may be wrong.”

But the opposite side of this
coin, confusing the people with
God, is just as dangerous. Har«

ris does not believe in “giving
the people what they want."

Harris switched to talk about
his personal experience as a col<
umnist. '

“I am frequently asked,
‘Where do you get your mater-
ial? and I always reply, ‘I steal
it.‘ n

He claims that few people
read anything worthwhile to-
day, so the field is open for a
re - interpreter of traditional
ideas “The professional writer
is always reading; a writer who
stops reading stops thinking."

* * *

Another question people often
ask is, “Don’t you find it hard
to turn out a column every
day?_” He does not have diffi-
culty finding topics and be-
lieves "the man who has to
slave away at a creative job is
not in the right job"

Harris always tries for hon-
esty, outspokenness and a per-
sonal approach in his column.
“Beneath the flimsiest subject
1 try to insert a serious vein."

Speaking of the reasons for
becoming a columnist Harris
stated, “In spite of the nervous
strain it involves, the profes-
sional holds an irresistible
lure. It lets a man express him—
self on any subject he
pleases.”

 

Don't look now. but . . .
Summer is almost here—-
