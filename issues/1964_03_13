Republican Keynoter' Hatfield
.ls Influential New Party Man

One of the most influential
new faces in the Republican
party, Mark 0, Hatfield, will
serve as keynote speaker for
the Republican Mock political
convention on April 9. Current-
ly Hatfield is serving his sec-
ond term as Governor of Ore-
gon.

The 41 year old Governor
holds a Master’s degree from
Stanford University. Before
running for political office Hat-
ﬁeld served as associate pro-
fessor of political science and
dean of students at Willamette
University, where he did his
undergraduate Work.

Hatfield served two terms in

HATFIELD

the state legislature and one
term as secretary of state be-
fore running for Governor. In a
state with 75,000 more regis~
tel‘ed Democrats than Republi—
cans, Hatfield has scored two
impressive victories in the race
for Governor, the last coming
with a margin of 68,000 votes.

During his political career.
Hatfield has openly disavowed
support from the John Birch so-
ciety and has managed to win
the support of organized labor.
Recently he has been involved
in a campaign to bring indus-
try into Oregon.

On his record as Governor,
Hatfield presently is considered
as a dark horse for the Repub-
lican Presidential and Vice
Presidential nominations. He
has also been prominently men
tioned for the position of per-
manent chairman of the Repub-
lican National Convention, a
post for which he has received

 

wide support among leading
Republicans. ,
At Grinnell, Hatfield Will de-
liver the keynote address to the
opening session of the Repub-
lican Convention, Thursday
night, April 9. Current plans
are to have Hatfield spend
Thursday night on campus and
to act as presiding officer for
the Republican platform ses-
sion Friday afternoon. Due to
commitments in Oregon, Hat-
field will have to leave the Grin-
nell campus before the nomi-
nating session Friday night.

Hughes Displays Political ‘Finesse’
Morrisons Make‘A Shaky landing

By Dave Baetz

Iowa Governor Harold E.
Hughes gave a group of inter-
ested Grinnell students a prac-
tical lesson in the easiest way
to skim frosting off a “politi-
cal cake" here last week—he
sat on one! 1

Featured, along with Gov-
ernor Frank B, Morrison, Ne:
braska, as one of the weekend’s
“politicians in r e s i d e n c 8"
Hughes gave his accidental Sit-
on demonstration last Thurs-
day night in Langan hall.

The local Tasty Pastry shop
had prepared the giant cake,
complete with Iowa and Nebras-
ka official State Seals, for pre~
sentation to Hughes just prior
to a late night political “bull-
session” in Langan lounge.
Before the presentation could
be made, however, Governor
Hughes Went into the room
where the cake was hidden to
make a telephone call. He
emerged seconds later grinning
broadly, with a tell-tale chunk

* * *

 

of frosting clinging to the Seat
of his pants.

While all of Governor Hughes‘
problems occurred after he had
reached the campus, Governor
Morrison, for a time, had seri-
ous doubts that he and Mrs.
Morrison would ever arrive in
Grinnell.

The Morrisons were sched-
uled to arrive at the Grinnell
airport last Wednesday at 6:00
pm. However, due to a snow-
storm, gusty winds and a low
cloud ceiling over the area,
they couldn’t locate the air-
port once they got here and fi-
nally had to turn back and
make a shaky landing in New-
ton. They finally arrived on
campus by car at about 9:30
p. in.

After both, Governors were
safely at Grinnell, they spent
two days attending classes,
meeting with students and fac»
ulty over coffee, attending cam-
pus events and participating in
late-night bull sessions in col-
lege dormitories.

The Governors, accompanied
by an army of newsmen, at-
tended the Political Process
class Thursday morning and a
Seminar in American Studies,
where the press brigade was
turned back, early in the after-
noon.

While Gov. Morrison, pic-
ured below eating breakfast in
Cowles, flew back to Omaha for
an important meeting Thurs-
day afternoon, G o v e r n o r
Hughes, 6’3” and 235 lbs,
donned some basketball togs
and took to the court for a short
workout with the Grinnell var-
sity. Hughes, a former high
school basketball star froin Ida
Grove, sank one out of five free
throws and spent some time
talking with members of the
team before heading for the
showers. (Picture, Page 3.)

Thursday night the YD's and
YR’s co-sponsored a banquet
for the Governors and their
wives, Mrs. Hughes arrived
late that afternoon, and then
the first families attended the
Lenox Quartet concert. Govern-
or Hughes spent the night in
Langan, Governor Morrison
slept in West Norris and Mrs.
Morrison stayed in Haines. Mrs.

Hughes returned to Des Moines
Thursday night.

Faculty Wives

Mrs. James Stauss and Mrs.

Quad Expectations

There is probably no more suspenseful moment in
the Quad year than the night of the AWS formal din-
ner, when the lights suddenly go on and the new board
members stand to be recognized. Wednesday night was
a night of excitement, glory, and expectation. The ex-
citement has dwindled—hall celebrations and room
decorations for the winners have run their course, The
glory will soon be gone—when those all night meetings
begin. The expectation, however, must remain. The
women of the quad have elected their leaders and they
expect something from them. Next year might see some
definite moves made in the field of integrated dorms.
The new house presidents should have definite opinions
in this area and should enlighten themselves on the
problems and possibilities involved in such a process.
Campus opinion demands increased leadership in
Women’s positions, especially in the senate. Much of

the hall tenor influencing

depend on the hall president. The questions of responsi-
ble leadership in rule enforcement and policy creation
must be answered by a positive board which has both
direction and aim. This year’s AWS board has had ex-
cellent direction, has often illustrated positive action,
and has operated with the interests of the quad women
at heart. We see another bright year on the AWS hori-
zon. The excitement and glory may soon be oven The
hard, often thankless work is just beginning. But are

Goldberg Favors House Civil Rights Bill;
Supports Senate Attempts for Cloture

To the Editor:

The Civil Rights Bill which
was passed by the House of
Representatives a little more
than a month ago will soon be
considered by the Senate. This
essential piece oi legislation
Contams provisions to make
into enforctble law the constlr
tulional rights of all peoples to
vote in federal elections, to
have'lree access to public ac-
commodations, to attend inte
grated schools, and to take ad
vantage of equal employment

opportunities under iederal con».
tracts and in the federal govern-l

menu.

A block oi eighteen Southern
Senators is prepared to iilibus-
ter in an effort to kill the bill,
or to force eventual compro~
mise on its most important
provisions, it is likely that this
filibuster Will be allowed to Con-
tinue for several Weeks to satr
isiy those who are in favor of
the bill, but have strong teela
ings favoring unlimited debate.

[At this time there will still be

 

three votes lacking or the two
thirds majority necessary in in
voke cloture oi debate.

or our Senators from lowa,
Senator John Miller (R.) is to
be congratulated for his decis-
ion to vote for clorure, while
Senator Bourke B. Hickenloop-

Letters to the Editor
. Student for Creativity ‘Over the Analytical at Grinnell ,

To the Editor:

At Grinnell, a destructive at-
tempt at a uniform approach
to life is apparent even, or
especially, in the iritellectual
approach altered to us mental-
ly gifted children; these intel-
lectual restrictions are more
profound than the social ones.
America has grown with the
scientific attitude as a tame
lizer; in that tradition, when
we come to Grinnell, we are
taught to objectify and analyze
everything. We seek in empir-
ical facts and precise logical
proofs a resting place for our
ambivalent belleis in the na-
lure of man and or good and
evili I

We also learn to objectify or-
der and learn to respond posi-
tively to it. We try to deﬁne
our primary terms and outline
principles of ordering. We find
almost everything can be ex-
plained in some way or has

some order. We then come to
see meaning—in all its senses,
scientific. esthetic, and ethic
#as a real fact of the World,
but not as true or false; the
multiplicity of orders makes
everything seem equally insig-
nificant,

We see the apparent dichot-
omy between the order of the
world and the things in the
world. The things are of them»
selves utterly meaningless,
while the naked order stands
shivering, a hollow oiispring
of the human mind. Man, we
then must conclude, has no ulr
timate, objectively truthful na~
ture, for the external world
does not really exist as he sees
it, and the order of his mind
describes nothing but iancy.
At no point inthis objective ap-
proach to ethical life are any
values even near to being
found; at somelpoint, depend
ing on his persistency and abil-

 

Roberison Comments on Yoga

Explains Effect

To the Editor:

Phil Brown's brief discussion
of Yoga exercise and its basic
rationale 'was interesting. How-
ever, his comments on the an-
atomical and physiological has
is indicates a basic lack of un-
derstanding of the circulatory
system and its functioning. One
gets the impression that be im-
putes to gravity 3 major con-
trol of arterial circulation, if he
were correct in this, mainte<
nance of an erect posture in—
sures that the best oxygen sup»
ply goes to the toes. Actually
the arterial flow is relatively
little aiiecied by gravity, being
dependent on the iorce or the
heart beat, augmented by the
elastic character of the major
arteries adiscent to the heart,
such as the aorta. To assume
that standing in the “head
stand" position gives the heart
“a rest from its usual task”
is not only false but indicative
oi a lack of understanding.
Purely on a gravity basis, he
is saying that it requires more
work oi the heart in pump
blood from the same area to
the legs when the body posr
tion is reversed, to say nothing:
oi the supply to the viscera. ‘

The major effect of a headl
stand on the circulation is onl
the return of Venous blood (0'

that effect is not a beneficxali

that return path are devoid of
valves, as are some of their
main tributaries. Others, such
as the internal jugulars, have
very ineffective valvesi Thus a
prolonged headstand wo uld
tend to result in stagnation of
venous blood rather than in a
better oxygen supply to the
brain, Accumulation of carbon
dioxide as a result of this will
stimulate breathing rate and
also bring about increased

Possibly the psychological
effects of the exercise are use-
ful in helping the individual
reach a state in which he is
more amendable to the philos~
Dpy or Yoga. Perhaps the Con-
trolled posturing has value as
exercise for muscle systems.
The lack of understanding of
the structure and functioning of

tory system is disturbing.

lty, every student who uses this
approach must quit in failure.

Although some never begin
this approach to ethics, since
they are satisfied that man is
evil and needs to be restricted
and since the objectivecrdered
approach reflects their restrict-
ed society, those who do are
left deeply dissatisfied. They
revolted in the first place trend
the stereotyped imageiof evil
man that the social restrictions
or any society imply, but they
could discover no alternative.
These people must then reluc-
tantly accept the resuiciive
middle class American Values
(Grinnell’s), or allow common
passions and semi-conscious
bellefs to dominate, or aim-
lessly revolt against the order
and restrictions of society.
This is the cause of "diven
gent” behavior; hence, the
negative attitude./

Students can learn that the
analytical method — which is
Grinnell's Way of lifevis no!
the only way. Someone can
demonstrate that a novel is not
a point in a literary history and
that philosophy need not be a
study of alternative beliefs.

Art and philosophy are cre<
alive disciplines, which strive
for beauty and truth. If these
are not empty terms, if values
can be found and not acquired,
then the creative approach to
life is proper, Can we ever ac-
cept that the apparent dicho-
tomy between things and the
mind is only the dichotomy be-
tween order and creative order,
or no real dichotomy at all?
Creativity (which must operaro
underground at Grinnell) at
least allows us choice in our
decisions — in step beyond logi-
cal limitations.

Grinneii's ACLU Head Presents

Lane's Opinions on Assassination

To the Editor:

A shadow of secrecy clouds
the investigation of President
Kennedy’s assassination While
public and world opinion com»
pelled President Johnson to ap-
point the present commission
headed by Justice Warren, its
original intent, to Conduct a full
public investigation of the
assassination, has been trans-
formed into a supercsecret
probe. Warren himself has
stated “some of the facts in
this case will never be known
In your lifetime” The Warren
Commission is restricting its in-
yestigation only to evidence
submitted by the Dallas Police,
FBI, and the Secret Service
Before public protest, led by
Mark Lane, was voiced, the
Commission refused to have
counsel appointed for Oswald,
and denied the right of cross«
examination; they still refuse
the right of presentation of new
evidence, and have maintained
their secrecyr

, Under these circumstances

Mark Lane, a prominent New ’

.York lawyer and former as-
selnblyman, decided to submit
to the Warren Commission a
lawyer's brief evaluating the
evldence leaked to the public.
Lane was astonished to discov-
er numerous contradictlons in
the government’s case. startled
by his findings. he determined
to conduct his own investiga-
tion by going to Dallas and in-
terviewing witnesses. He has
obtained interviews, photostats
of police affidavits, and other
information directly Contradict-
ing the government‘s contenr
tioiis. '

Some of his

findings have

 

(l) The murder weapon was
transformed from a German
Mauser to an Italian Carbine
after the FBI discovered that
Oswald had ordered an Italian
rifle from a mail order house.

(2) The manufacturer of the
Italian Carbine Stated that in
his opinion the weapon was in-
capable of the accuracy needed
to shoot the-President from the
sixth floor ’of the Book Deposi-
tory Building,

(3) The authorities claim
that three shots were fired, yet
ﬁve bullets were found.

(4) The opinion of four doc-
tors auending Kennedy at Park—
land Hospital that the wound in
the neck was an entrance
wound has changed after the
FBI presented the doctors with
a felt accompli. ‘

(5) The witness to Tippitt's
murder swore the murderer
was “short, stocky, with curly
hair"; Oswald was medium
height, and thin with sparse
hair.

(6) The paraffin test by an em
pert determined that Oswald
probably did not fire a riﬂe
on November 22‘

(7) According to the District
Attorney’s own report, Oswald
walked out of the surrounded
Dallas Book Depository Build-
ing unmolested, walked three-
quarters of a mile, took a bus
back to where he had walked
from, took a taxi with a non-
existent taxiedrlver threerquar—
ters of a mile past his house,
and then went back home to get

Sanity of Stones

A great deal of money has
been made recently since the
death of President Kennedy
“Memorial books" selling for $2
each have been printed by both
the AP and UPI and have sold
in the millions of copies. Other-
mementoes of the late Presi-
dent include a 97c JFK salt and
pepper set; a candy bar named
“Vig'ah”; an “Eternal Flame
of Light to Remember" selling
for 31 which is advertised to
burn for 50,000 hours; JFK
phonographs, records, photo‘-
graphs, busts, desk weights,
etc.

Newsweek recently called it
a “memorial boom" and has
quoted a Washington. D. c.,
novelty manufacturer as say-
ing: “People are always hun-
gry for the buck."

“Togetherness” it appears,
according to the Burlington
County (N. J,) Department of
Civil Defense, is just one more
virtue of nuclear war. If you're
one of those stubborn people
who is unable to realize how
"close" family members get to
each other while cramped to-
gether inside a fallout shelter,
then you obviously haven't

 

heard about “Operation Togeth-
erness” — the latest thing in
modern family livingiconducte
ed January 18 and 19 in Marl-
ton, N. J.

in order to prove that even
under the minor stresses of a
nuclear war life can be wonder-
ful, more than 200 Volunteers
emiombed themselves for 24
hours “under exactly the same
conditions as might be expect-
ed in any public shelter in the
event of a nuclear attack,"
During the 24 hours the volun-
teers slept on cuts and ate “sur-
vival biscuitsr" Realism was
provided by a tape recording
public address system which
simulated the warning period
followed by the attack, with

simulated radio messages re-l

porting conditions in the area
and across the United States.
All the volunteers, as far as it
is known, appear to have sur-
vived the experience

Of course, there are always
a few malcontents who don't
believe in such things as “to»
getherness." TWO hundred local
residents picketed the shelter
while “Operation Together-
ne‘s's'VWas being conduCtédl'

 

knowledge of the assassin (5)
he does maintain that if we
are to accept the news leaks,
Oswald could not have been
the assassin, Of course it may
logically be argued that the
government has not divulged
pertinent information which
might contradict Lane's as-
sumptions. Hence what is need-
ed is an open public hearing
where all the facts can be
weighed before a commission
which is representative of the
American public, not a former
CIA Chief, a former FBI agent,
two Dixiercrats, a Republican
Senator, and on inﬂuencial
businessman, who presently
constitute the Commission.

The petition which is being
circulated this week calls for
an "open public hearing," and
requests “that some counsel
representing the interests of
the late Lee Harvey Oswald be
permitted the right of cruss~ex—
aminau‘on and the right of pre-
sentation of evidence bearing
upon (Oswald's) role, if any,
in the assassination. r . ."

A nation-wide organization
has been formed on this basis.
Groups are springing up on
numerous campuses. The pres-
sure which these groups have
generated has already con-
vinced the Warren Commission
to appoint a lawyer for Oswald
and to allow Mark Lane to tes~
tify. Public opinion can also
influence the government to
call an open public hearing.

Thoughts About New Dorm

Tlli

the last of two articles by Ann Lousin concerning the

construction of a new men’s dorm. The first appeared in last

Week's issue.

(For those of you who were
not with me last week, the first
part of this column was a de-
fense of the off-campus men.
This week, I should like to de-
fend on campus women.)

The Board of Trustees’ pro-
posal to build a new men’s
dorm is doubly ridiculous be-
cause I) there is no need to
pull thirty men hack on cam-
pus; and Z) the need for some
drastic changes in the women’s
dorms is overwhelmingly great-
er than the need for better ac-
commodations for the men. For
example, Loose hall, which was
built in 1947, was the last wom»
en’s dorm, whereas the college
has since then‘erected the dou—
ble Younkers in 1948 and the
double Norrises in 1960.

At the time that the college
built Loose, it left one whole
wall solidly without windows
with the promise that within a
few years a Loose tower would
be built, approximately the
height of Main hall, so that
the Quadrangle would then be
architecturally balanced, There
were also to be a parking area
for the Women students and
their guests and a proper en-
trance off Eighth avenue, some-
what like the Main hall en-
trance. This would have re-
lieved much of the traffic at
Main and offered a second en-
trance for women after the
loggia was closed. Needless to
say, the women are still wait-
ing for these additions,

MeanWhile, the over-crowd»
Ing of the loggia continues.
Main hall undoubtedly holds
the worst accommodations on
campus. In that peak year of
1960-61, Main, which was built
to accommodate about forty
women comfortably, held sixty»
three uncomfortably. The wom—
an of Main have, in reality, no
lounge, as anyone who has ever
been in the “Q'uadrangle
Drawing Room" at lunchtime
can testify. When Gardner
lounge replaced the Little
Theatre the Trustees said that
it would become the Main Hall
lounge in 1964, Now the plans
are to keep it a public meeting-
room, (for “dating couples,”
Dr. Bowen said.) So Main hall
still won’t have its own lounge.

The rooms in Main are un-
doubtedly the smallest and, on
the whole, the noisest in the en-
tire Quad. Sound carries as if
all the rooms were wired on a
hall intercom. ls it any wonder
that the chief obstacle to abol-
ishing freshman dorms is that
upperclassmen refuse to move

' out of larger soundproofed
singles in Loose into miniscule
CChOvchambers in Main with
less than minimum airvspace?

Speaking of wiring, the elec-
tricity of the Quad. especially
in the five oldest dorms is dan-
gerously inadequate I have
leen rooms designated by the
architect as singles actually
turned into doubles with only
one wallsocket. The number of
appliances on the one outlet
is enough to cause an overload
and possibly a fire—~as it did in
my room in my freshman year
in Main.

Kitchenette facilities are
hardly adequate and often less

 

than what North Campus has.
Instead of the eleven legal and
several extra-legal refriger-
ators that the men have, the
women have four legal refriger-
ators and apparently no illegal
ones, One' kitchenette often
serves 3060 women, with the
result that any maintenance is
virtually impossible, the kitch-
enettes are ill-equipped, and
those who want tea or coffee
must make it in, their rooms
with the illegal, but necessary,
coils.

The women’s lounges are no
bigger, and sometimes smaller.
than those in the men’s halls,
even though they serve 25 per
cent more people per lounge,
Three of the women’s halls
have poorly-equipped recrea-
tion rooms with furniture that
look as though even the un-
ion would reject it. One of these
rec. rooms houses the one tele-
vision for over 500 women,
(North Campus ratio: 11 for
600,)

And then there are “terrace”
apartments-the basements of
Cleveland, J a m e s, Haines,
Read and Loose. In I-Iaines and
Read these rooms are separ-
ated only by tissue-paper parti-
tions. Empirical evidence has
demonstrated that a Coke
dropped in the farthest room
at one end of the floor can be
heard most clearly in the room
at the other end.

The Trustees and Messrs.
Bowen, Stauss, and Ludwig
have long neglected the renova-
tion of the women's dorms in
spite of protestations by two
Deans of Women—largely be-
cause the little sheep of South
Campus do such a dandy job
of being Hausfrauen and mak-
ing the best of their situation.
Many women have tried to ame-
liorate some of the atrocious
color of Skidmore, Owings,
eto.'s interior decorator by
making their own curtains and
dyeing chair - covers, bed-
spreads, and rugs to match. It
is amazing what they can some-
times do with cramped, illrdeo
orated rooms.

However, mis has gone far
enough. It is high time that the
ewes of the Quad stopped baa-

Friday. March l3. I964

Premiere offellon's ‘Daniel Prince' March 15-18.
Open Stage ln-lhe-Round. Sludenl Music Employed

This Sunday, Monday, Tues-
day and Wednesday nights,
Grinnell audiences will have an
opportunity to witness a unique
drama experience when DAN-
IEL PRINCE, a play by Keith
Spencer Felton, is presented in
Arena Theater.

The play, sponsored by Na-
tional Collegiate Players and
Grinnell Players, portrays a
day in the life of a young man
in Paris of the 188035. Felton,
who also is producing and di-
recting the play, describes it
as a “dreamrpoem,” a phrase
which indicates a facet of the
drama’s psychological frame-
Work,

Through many Varied series
of events, the play reveals its
protagonist’s search for truths
within his existence, His rela-
tionships with an actress and
professor shed varying per-
spectives on his character.

Discussing the drama, which
he wrote last semester, Felton
states, “The Counterbalance
between ‘ events’ of futile
search, and fleeting moments
of awareness provide a basis
for the play’s action. Symbolic
values are attached to many
facets of the play. I chose a late
nineteenth century setting, be-
cause I ieel that the color and'
vivacity of life of this period,
which is reflected in the music
of Wagner, the painting of
Manet and Renoir, and the writ
ing style of Stendhal and Flaur
bert contain a glimpse of the
intricate deception which so-
ciety of this period constructed
to cloud honest encounter with
human dilemmas. I am fasci-
nated by the Romantic—Victor-

ing contentedly in the face of
steadily worsening conditions,
especially when it is so obvious
that they are discriminated
against in housing. Now that
the Trustees have simply com~
pounded the matter by agree—
ing to build another men’s
dorm with the money allotted
for housing from the Ford
grant, I hope that the women
will, at long last, insist that
they allot some of.that dona-
tion to the women instead,

ian rituals of living, which in
so many ways reflect the frenzy
we find in our own era.”

Asked about the technical
phase of the production, Felton
replied: “I am intrigued by
the kinesthetic elements in
drama, as well as character
depiction. As a result, we have
fashioned a set which, within
the confines , of the Arena
Theater provrde us with five
acting or stage areas, which
serve to relate the characters
through means of changing per-
ception, We have attempted,”
Felton continued, “to employ
several art film photographic
techniques, which enhance the
possibilities of production in
a foursided arena,"

DANIEL PRINCE is the first
production in the Grinnell
Arena Theater which uses the
theater-in-therrou'nd technique,
with the audience completely
surrounding the actors. ’

 

In the/lead role of the young

poet is Bruce McConachie. Sue

Mifflin, Sundell Voted to All-Conference Team

Cagers End Season
With 12-10 Record

By Jack Harrod

Paced by the record-shatter.

dell, Jim Mifﬂin and 'Jeff
Frantz, Grinnell's varsity has»
ketball team closed out the sea-
son last weekend with a split
on a twoAgai-ne road trip to
Knox and Monmouth. Ending
with a 979 conference mark, the
«lagers gained sole possession
of fifth place in the rugged
Midwest Conference.

Overall, the Scarlet and
Black sported]: lZ-l0 record,
including an 89-87 overtime
loss to the University of
South Dakota
John Pfitsch tabbed as one 01
the best efforts by a Griuneli
live in his long tenure as
head coach.
in the 80-78 loss to Knox,

Frantz and Miiilin accounted
for all but 21 of the Pioneer
points, Frantz poured in his ca-
reer high of 35 markers and
Milflin added 22. However, no
other Grinnellian Could Con»
tribute more than 5 points to
the cause. The Pioneers were
handicapped when Sundell was
forced to sit out most of the
contest due to foul trouble and
netted only 10 rebounds.

Knox had four starters in
double figures. Doug Ziech had
19, Many Pschirrer 17, Jeff
Sandburg 14, and Brandon Pi-
per 12. Ii: was Ziech who notched
two free throws with three sec-
onds rema ing to pull it out
for the Siwash.

Avenging an earlier 83'79 loss
to Monmouth, the Pioneers
came from behind to reverse
the score in the season's finale
with the Fighting Scots. Again

Fl‘antz and Mifflin carried the.

brunt of the Scarlet attack,

tallying 25 and 23 points respec--

tively. They were backed up
by Randy Morgan with 14 mark-
ers and Sundell with ll. Mon-

this year Mifflin collected 438

‘Dr. Annis Defends Rising Costs.

\ Says
L l By John Wolf

The American Medical Asso-
Nation’s opposition to the pro-
posed King-Anderson medical-
care~forathe-aged bill was sum-
marized by the organization’s
president, Dr. Edward R. An-
nis, Tuesday evening in Rob-
jrts Theatre.

D,r. Annie refuted the charge

‘ that medical expenses have
iapidly increased in recent
ears, He agreed that expenses
I’iave indeed increased, but
““we’re not talking about the
name product” when we try to
— vompare medical practices of
today with those of a few years
ack. Today _we are dealing
.with “the new medicine of the
atomic age."

Hospital expenses have ina
greased sharply but of each
5500 hospital bill, $350 goes to
Bay non-medically trained la-

or which is needed to operate
apecialized equipment, Dr. An-
his noted.

Furthermore, he mentioned,
ghost persons have found a way
0 cope with the increased
posts. “The infant health insur-
hnce business has grown as
medicine has become more
nostly.”

Today I46 million Americans
re covered by some type of
Eealth insurance. Some 10,400.-
00 of the nation's 18 million
citizens over 65. years of age
have health protection

Dr. Annis also claimed that
eople seem to have the wrong
onception of health insurance.
“Health insurance should be
used to protect savings and in-
come; it should not be used to
cover the expense of a check-up
or a chest x—ray, Nobody com-
flains that they don't get to use
lie or fire insurance, but many
people certainly complain about
rot getting to use their health
nsurance."

Politics enters the medical in-
lurance picture because not all
ersons can afford such protec—
on. “We are not against gov-
prnment in medicine,” Dr. An-
his stressed. ”What we would
like to see, however, is that
those who need the protection

Medicine Today Worth Price

get it — not each member of
one segment of the population.

“The King - Anderson bill
would provide hospital care for
all persons over 55 only in has—
pitals under government con-
tract. But many people over 65
are quite well Off, Of our 18
million senior citizens, only 2.5
million are receiving old age
assistance. There is no doubt
that these 2.5 million should be
helped.” »

Drr Annis said that the three-
year-old Kerr-Mills law is help-
ingthose 2.5 million senior citi-
zens who cannot afford medical
bills. Under this plan, the fed-
eral government subsidizes
each of the 5|) states in provid—
ing aid to these people, This
plan costs 150 r’niilion dollars
annually.

A second feature of the Kerr»
Mills law, Dr. Annis claimed,
has run into federal obstacles.
This feature also works on a
state basis and gives help to
those older people who are self-
reliant but who would find it
difficult to meet a large medi~
cal bill without mortgaging
some property.

The second feature of Kerr-
Mills is in effect in 36 states
(including Iowa) and costs $350
million annually. Under’this
plan, the details of which dif-
fer slightly from state to state.
an elderly person may own his
own home of any value, own a
car, have a limited income.
and have limited savings while
receiving assistance.

Dr. Annis is also the head of
the World Medical Association.
He said that in this capacity he
has seen a ”deterioration of
quality of medical practices in
countries where a system of
medical care like King-Auden
son has been implemented.”

The backers of King-Ander-
son are apparently deliberately
deceiving the public by saying
that each wage earner will be
taxed a maximum of $12 per
year when in actuality, Dr. An-
nis claimed, the cost will
amount to $27.50 a year.

“If they have a good bill, let

 

them sell it honestly,” he
urged. -

Grinnell Young Republicans to Attend Sioux City Convo;
Vice-President Ferris Is Candidate for Slate Chairman

Bob Savage, president of the
Young Republican Club, will
head a group of 24 members
in attendance at the Iowa Col-
lege Young Republicans’ Con»
vention, to be held Friday and
Saturday in Sioux City...

“The Grinnell chapter has a
special interest in the conven-
tion this year,” declared Sav-
age, “with Roger Ferris,.a
Grinnell junior, running for
State Chairman."

Ferris, vice president of the
YR'S, has been actively cam-
paigning for the last month at
schools all over the state. Ac-
cording to the candidate, there
are two areas where work must
be done in the Young Republi-
can party of Iowa. “First, it is

imperative that we increase co-
0 p e r ati o n and interaction
among all clubs in Iowa, and
between the clubs and state or-
ganization, Equally important
is the need for greater interac-
tion with the Senior Party—
Young Republicans must be-
come part of the Party!"

“My goal as State Chairman
of the Iowa College Young Re-
publicans would be to make
YR’s a meaningiul part oi the
Party, and all programs which
I present will work toward that
end.”

"Our candidate has the 5014
id support of the University of
Iowa club and 4 smaller clubs
in the southeastern area," stat-
ed Savage. If elected, Ferris

will serve as chairman of the
15 Ipwa clubs.

The election, to be held Sat-
urday morning, will be fol-
lowed by a banquet in the ai-
ternoon. Also scheduled are
speeches by Senator Peter Dom-
inick of Colorado and Robert
Ray, Iowa State Chairman.

Other Grinnell YR members
playing an active role in con-
vention activities are Phil
Johnson who will serve on -tha
Resolutions committee, John
Black on the Credentials com-
mittee and William Pegg on the
Rules committee.

The ICYR Convention, held
annually in the spring, coin-
cides with meetings of other
YR groups in Sioux City this
weekend. i
