Another isdaimel

In August a Peace corps trainee, Charles Kamcn, ins
terrupted a Rotary Club meeting at which the House Un—
American Activities Film “Operation Abolition” was being
shown, expressed rather openly his opposition to the film,
and provided the incident for a little known amendment
to the Peace Corps Act passed in the last days of this ses—
sion of Congress .

After the incident which received wide publicity in
the American newspapers, Con 'ressmen placed a ,2 eat deal
of pressure on Peace Corps Di ector R. Sargent Sh ver to
dismiss Kamen, but Shriver refused to dismiss hinl on
'rounds otli than psychological tests, security investiga—
tions and ab ity tests to determine his suitability for Peace
Corps assignments '

Congress has,expressed its feelings on this matter in
an amendment to the Peace Corps Act, however, which has
received considerably less mention than the Kamen inci-
dent. This amendment is a disclaimer affidavit differing

‘om tllat attached to the National Defense Education Act
of 1958 only in that it does not require the Peace Corps
candidate to deny membership in a long list of specific or—
ganizations.

Such an oath is really of no value since most Coni-
munists would not hesitate to take it. However, much
more important than this is the fact that this law extends
into the very vague area of an individanl’s belief in right
and wronigr and leads to debates such as those of the House
Un-American Activities Committee. Although most of us
would object to having a Peace Co ps member who advocat-
ed the overthrow of our constitutional form of government,
we question whether opposition to the film “Operation
Abolition" or the House Un-American Activities Committee
constitutes advocation of the overthrow of Constitutional
government. The history of this amendment would indicate
Ellis, however.

It is unfortunate that this amendment has been at-
tached to a bill which is in all other ways an outstanding"
piece of legislation. The first section of the bill states the
purpose of the law as two-fold: to provide technical aid by
the United States for any nation wanting it and to provide
an opportunity for Americans to better understand cultures
and problems different from their own.

Two years ago 20 colleges and universities refused to
accept funds from the National Defense Education Act on
the basis of the disclaimer affidavit attached to it, Grinnell
was one of these with Bryn Mawr, Haverford. Princeton,
Antioch, Harvard, Oberlin, Radcliffe, Reed and others
Since this is again an issue which will involve students and
an area in which the voice of students is for great impor-
tance, perhaps we should'again express our opposition to
legislation of this sort. .

Secondly, this shows that programs such as Grinliell’s
“Fifth Year Abroad" to which no such stipulations are
attached have not yet been replaced by the Peace Corps.
We have already learned that some countries distrust the
sincerity of the United States government in this project,

and it is not likely that this disclaimer affidavit will erase ,

this distrust. Apparently the work of private organizctions
in this area should be continued for some time to come.

dent Senate at its weekly meet-
ing Wednesday night.

The committee. now called

lormed by a motion made by
Senate speaker Cam l-iendershot.
Hendershot relinquished his
chairmanship of the meeting to
SGA president Bill Halaina so
that he might speak from the
floor as a member or the Sens
atc. .

Thc new committee will have
jurisdiction over all Senate buss
iness concerning executive cabs
inet appointments needing thc

tions and constitutional amend-
ments and byrlaivs.

Recommendations will also
be made by the committee to
the Senate on various budgets
and on iiiiids {or which the

Senate is responsible. Also, it

will be able to recommend

appropritae action on all
nmendmciiis to the SGA con—
stitution.

Furthermore, the committee
can make changes in amend-
ments submitted to it, providing
it has the consent oi the orig.

New Arts Center

An outstanding piece of cquip- ,

ment newly acquired by the Cole
legc is a pr-acti . pipe organ or
“Ha S Orgel". The instrument
has just been installed in the
college's new $1,400,000 Fine Arts
Center. which will be dedicated
this weekend,

Elbert Morse Smith, (modern
iorcign languages). College or.
ganist, explains that the instruc
ment is Called the “Haus Orgel”
01‘ house organ because its small
number or pipes and its com—
pactness make it ideal for res-
idence installation.

“The design and tonal qual-
ilies of the Haus Ol‘gel are
distinctly baroque, and similar-
to those of the small instruments
used in Europe during the time
\of Bach,” Smith said,

The console, or “key desk"
and the pipe case are char-
coal black to match the ﬂoors
and woodwork of the Fine
Arts Center. The keys of the
two manuals are of English
ivory.

The 280 varnished wood and
Silverccolol’ed metzil wines in
foul ranks are complctcly cxl
posed to view. They are gradu-
ated in size. l

Once again the Pioneers lead the Midwest Conference
in both team offense and team defense, averaging 356'
yards per game while holding their opponents to 184. Core
nell is second in both departments.

Dick Lamb. who graduated from Grinnell in 1950, is,
the Historian for the National Football Hall of Fame and
probably the foremost football historian in the United
States In lulnmaging' through his 1ecolds he came across
the fact that the first football game played at night withl
ll hts was played on Oct 5, 1900 between Grinnell andl
Drake in Des Moines. Drake won 6- 0.

With their 4 1 1ecord at this point, the Pioneers stand
a chance of compiling one of their best season 1"eco1ds inl
recent history Since 1920, the best Season mark a Pioneer
squad has had was 6-1-1 in 1926. The last si\ games of

The Grinnell Pioneers rolled
up new rushing and total offense
records while deteating their
fourth victim, the Beloit Buc-
caneers by the impressive score
of 23—0, Saturday at Ward Field,

All iour of the Scarlet touelr
downs were ground out by a
clicking rushing ottense that
'netted 488 yards before the tinal
gun sounded. The Pioneers scoi»
ed once in each of the first two
quarters, and twice in the third
to compile their winning total

Grinnell received the opening
kickoff, but was unable to move,
and was lorced to punt, Beloit
came out of the huddle with a
surprise, because Pete Lille, nor.
mally a right halfback, was
playing quarterback in place oi
Alleconference Jim Kupllc, The,
Bucs had no better luck than)
Grinnell in getting their oliensci
rolling and also kicked.

With the ball again, the ,
Pioneers posed the first scor—
ing threat of the game when 1
Ron Sandler got a handoff
from quarterback nick Or- ,
chard, on the first play from i
scrimmage and took off 1
around right end tor 67 yards
to the Beloit 13. The march g
dissolved as quickly as it be» 1
gau, for Orchard preparing
to pass, was hit hard by a Buc—
caneer lineman and fumbled,
guard John Jacobson recover-
ing for the opposition on their
own 23 yard liner

Atter regaining possession oil

Carleton Peterson made seven)
yards, and fullback John Hal'»‘
tung galloped 21 tor a first down‘
at the Belolt in yard stripe. Pour
plays later, Hartung plunged
over from the two to give Grin-I
nell the iii-st of six tallies of the)
contest with 3:07 remaining in]
thalfll‘st quarter. Marty Jacobs

’ 'son booted the extra point, and

the score read 7-0.

As the second quarter began,
so did another Scarlet drive,
which netted five straight first
downs betore the Buccaneer dee
fense tightened. and the Pioneers
missed another iirst by inches
at the Eelolt 3. One casualty re-t
suited from this series of plays
when quarterback Orchard was
injured, and was taken out for
the rest of the game,

The Buc's ofiense rolled for
a short while midway in the
second quarter. Lille’s running
and Kuplic‘s passing picked up
two quick first downs before
the Grinnell line tightened,

that the values of participation
In Sports more than compensated

at their comments:

the constant academic pressures,
to contribute something to the
college and to have a lot of
fun with a group of guys whom
I think are the greatest in the

Get Thomson: (cross country)
“I believe it is safe to say that
athletics have a negative effect
on my studies . . , (largely be—
cause) . , . of meets, especially
away meets. Friday afternoon
and most of Saturday are rare-

son these “lost weekends” build

that if he were to limit his pa~

lJoe Okumu Views Problem 0f Pan-Alricanism

by Joe Okumu
This article is one of many

monthly contributions I make ‘
to the Student Press Center l

in eastern and central Airic .
it is written for readers who
hav firm foundations in the
African movement. For this
reason, if any reader should
ﬁnd anything ambiguous, I
shall he most willing to dis-
cuss the assumed details.

When speaking of Pan-Afri-
loanisin, Ono’s attitude should not
‘ be shrouded by the mist of the
past, Everyone knows of the
heroic Fall-African movement;
, Dirbors, Blaisc Diagne, Fads
‘ more, Kwame Nkhruma and Jo-
,mo Kenyatta are great names
which will go down in history
with it.

The most important thing is to
consider the present forms and
contents of PansAt'l‘iCallisnl, its
political, social and economic
aspects and particularly its res
lations lo the student movement
in Africa,

Today one cannot detach the
Pan-African movement from its
colonial context. Colonialism still
makes for an unhappy atmoss

The question is how to ﬁght

A coherent’ and strong move-
ment is needed for all the Afri-
can states still under abject
‘subjugation, a movement that
,will make for an unshakahlc
solidarity that eventually will
be transformed into an ideology.

Tire African states under Mr
lonialism have labored under
common experiences. They
have lived under oppressive
conditions too dehased to de-
serve a .mention. Their devel»

”You don't have to he a cone

joy a beginning experience with
Yoga", explains West Norris
sophomore Phil Brown, who
has initiated a Yoga interest
group on campus.

Although Yoga, a form of
Hinduism, has philosophic impli—
cations, Brown‘s instruction will
focus on Hatha Yoga. the Yoga
of physical \vellrbeing. Tire idea
for the beginner is to hold one
of the basic yoga positions {or
a length of time while taking
deep, measured breaths, a whole

When studying the character.
istics of political make-up in
Africa, one is bound to meet
two tendencies: the tendency io
individual well—being as distinct
from tlrc tendency to community
welfare. FansAfncanism in the
present African context, with
its many political. social and
economic complexities, should
seek to accommodate the two
East and West tendencies.

Tile important thing is intake
advantage of the East~West d
vision. Because, for the A
can states, and inspired by the
Bandung Conference, the world
should be looked upon as be-
ing divided into ltwo regions.
The developed and the develop.
ing countries always seek to
extend their spheres of inﬂuence
and paternalism. So, the good
will be coming by itself, and
there is no need to beg for
economic assistance.

There is no need to ingl‘aiiv

or the West. There is what we
call “positive tralrsm” to

coming to these conferences
have a dirty to see that such
conferences succeed. If we have

We must therefore strive as
