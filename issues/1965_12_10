Into the past, '65, we did delve.

They searched through a basement that had gone to pot)

They found not the pot, but they found quite a lot.

And then came one of the year's greatest pleasant:

When Dean Slocum gave us her last Christmas

And old Bobby Sauers is gone, what a pity;

Thurston accounted ior this at-

“watchful waiting" policy.

The retiring Coil-[P president

special proposals, but rather had
Waited for issues to arise.

Among them were the north

need for better mental health ta-

challenge.

”Students are ready and willing

"and are anxious for positive and
creative leadership in this area of

Thurston suggested that fresh-

set up.

JLA: Its History And Future

By DICK SHADY

The Junior Liberal Arts exam
will not be given at the beginning
of next semester.

Last spring the faculty resolved
to place a one-year moratorium
on the exam and asked that “the
ﬁnal disposition of the examina-
tion be considered at some time
in the iuiure in conjunction with
a broad, comprehensive evalua-
tion of the entire curriculum."

The JLA was first proposed by
a special faculty curriculum com»
mittee in February or 1959. The
committee odvocaied that an ex-
uminauon be given to juniors,
with the objectives ot increasing
students' responsibility ior their
own education and stimulating a-
chievement in the liberal arts.

A special committee to design
such an exam was Elected, and
on Nov. 25, 1959, ii proposed a
twopart exam, consisting of the
Area Tests or the Graduate Rec-

 

ords Examination and an essay
section.

The test itself would examine
the ability of the student to “state
and discuss the similarities, analo-
gies, and diiierences among tine
major disciplines."

The original approach (using
specific texts) was abandoned in
favor of a “concepts" test. Nearly
one year later, on Oct. 19. 1960,
the Junior Exam committee prm
posed that each department sub-
mit to the Dean a list of “basic
Concepts and dominant issues" in
each discipline.

In January of 1961, the faculty
approved the proposal which pro<
Vided for Area Tests and a "con-
cepts" test on be given on the
class of ’63 in January, 1962.

The ﬁrst test would be experi-
mental and limited, with the Area
Tests counting twice as much as
the essays in grading. Four grades
uhigh pass, pass, low pass, and

no credit—were m be assigned,
with tour credits awarded [or a
high pass and two credits for pass
or low pass

The experimental and resnrlo
tive nature of the ﬁrst test was
emphasized, along with the fact
that "evaluations will be used in
making judgments regarding the
student’s competence ior graduate
study, employment, etc." Students
were required to take, but not to
pass, the nest, and there was no
eiiect on the grade-point.

The committee selected three

Another Tradition

I suppose each editor tries to find a novel way of
composing his final editorial. It’s a hard thing to do,
especially thinking up new expressions for thank you.
analyzing the past year, and choosing a clinching last

line.

I guess the easiest way is first to thank everyone
who has appeared on the masthead since January 8 this
ear. These people have, for varying lengths of time,
een able to overcome the feeling that a Grinnell stu—

dent must do nothing but study.
There are other people who deserve thanks, but

I’ll send them Christmas cards.
So we can get to the second part of the traditional
farewell editorial—in this case an analysis of 1965. And
for that, I think I will simply refer you to “Grinnell

Noel XII.”

Essentially, that leaves me with very little to say
except to note that the year has been, well, interesting.
Good luck on finals, and season’s greetings.

 

leggell Speaks at Cue,- Tuilions Up;
Results of Grading Survey Revealed

“The point oi education is still
the private person," Grinnell Pres-
ident Glenn Leggett emphasized at
Coe's annual Founder's Day Can-
vocation Nov. 30,

Education in the “good old
days,” before World War II, left
almost no means for the promising
students to find themselves,” Leg-
gett explained.

"What we all need to do today
is strengthen that part of the edu-
cational program which will Show
Students that their minds, and the
proper disciplines of their minds,
are what makes them unique,” Dr.
Leggett said. “Education trains
man to be preClse, but only man
can teach himself to think effecr
tively. . . . Thus, to enable each
individual to think more ellectiver
ly modern schools have become
more specialized than the self—
contained classrooms of the ‘good
old days.’ "

“This specialization is reﬂected
by the grouping at students accord-
ing to aptitude and innerest by to-
day‘s schools. . . . Hence. modern
education has become all enter-
prise which tends to reflect tastes
ol’ all its constituents a its laclllty,
students, and Classrooms."

$2700 will be the cost oi tuition
and board for a Carletonian next
year, an increase at a hundred dol-
lars over the present cost. Cornel-
lians have also had their total Cost
raised to $2600 {or the school year
1966-1967.

a ,

A survey last year at 55 univer-
sities and liberal arts schools re
vealed that 44 use the conventional

 

letter grades, l'ive use numeral
grades, three have a different type
of letter grading system, two issue
no grades except for college use,
and one gives grades only after
graduation,

Reed college uses the conven-
tional grades, but students do not
see them until aitcr graduation.
The grades are reported to ad-
visers when students need Counsel-
ing. Bennington and Sarah Law-
rence have eliminated grades but
periodically give to the students
Carefully written evaluations which
analyze thoroughly the student‘s
progress. For a student who is ap-
plying to graduate school, how-
ever, both Bennington and Sarah
Lawrence supply the conventional
ratings. Carleton and the Univer-
sity of Rochester allow a student
to take a course outside his major
and be graded on the pass-(ail sys-
tem. The Universlty of Minnesota’s
General College experimented with
giving every student in the general
art courses an "A” at the end at
the quarter. This was to encourage
individual creativity by eliminat-
ing a grade [actor which might
make students overly cautious. The
university hopes to try this system
In other Classes as well.

The one problem the Colleges
have is the graduate school’s de-
nland for a deimite interpretation
or a student's academic standing.

(Ed. now: The Grinnell faculty
is presenlly considering pro.
posais to initiate some torrn bi a
pass-rail grading system here.
The proposals were presented at
Monday’s faculty meeting. No de
cision will be made until next
semester.)

Alumnus Won'l Supporl School;
Says Noihing Changed al Grinnell

To the Edimr:

i understand that five students
have been expelled iron. Grinnell
for having i. party in the men's
halls with women aiter hours.
When I was out there last winter
for a visit, students were being
suspended and put on conduct and
academic probation [or drinking,
being in the women's hulls after
hours, having women in their
room, etc. There’s a lot oi rule~
breaking at Grinnell and a lot or
heavy punishment. The administra-
tion was still saying, "This is
another example or Grinnellians’
inability to take responsibility to.-
their own lrvcs. When the students
demonstrate that they can handle
adult freedom in an adult and re-
sponsible manner, it will be grunt.
cd them.“ This is the same cunt
students were hearing when i inst
came to Grinncll n. 1960. Nothing
has changed, From what 1 under
stand, in fact, there is loss irccdon.
at oriuncll lhan ever beiore. Rules
are stricter in all areas, more strict
ly enforced; the administration i
less sympathetic to the studen
the oli~cnmpus houses have been
closed; a glass building has been
built, providing tor a very modern,
public place ior students to go.

Most students aren’t permitted
cars, there’s hardly any place for
them to go downtown, they are cut
off train the outside world. and any
other avenues to privacy are being
reduced. The rooms. the class.
roolns,, the corridors, and campus
are all public domain.

Where does a student live his
own life, find his own valuES free
iron. control, apply what he has
learned iron. his liberal education
to a vcallife situation, experiment,
expand himself? 1 think that what
is happening at Grinnell is very
damaging to the students. Under
the circumstances. it almost looks
as it l'ulcebreaking is virtuous, it
certainly dcnnmstrates student’s
awareness that they have more
rights thm. the administration
seems to feel thcy do. To break

 

a rule is not always n bad thing.
It depends on the rule, doesn't i\’!

 

Five years ago some students
were answering this view with:
“Then why not change the rules
through proper channels? Acting
in a criminal way is no good eith-
er." This was being said iive years
ago and I imagine it’s still being
said. The bald truth however, is
that students at crinncll College
have never been permitted free.
dom to live their owll lives, to ex-
periment. or allowed to lake re-
sponsihil v (or their actions. The
adminlsll [ion has not acted in the
host interests Di the students, but
in their own intcrcsts, which ut
many points conflict with the stu-
dents' interests. I'm not surprised
lhal students break rules, that the
Boar's Head Dinner is always a
near-riot, that the spring riot iSi
always an explosion which never
quite Collies off I’m also not sur-
prised that punishments and strict
er rules don’t ease [he sitintrion but
somehow worsen it. The student
body at Grinllell is made up ct

eople, and people usually want to

live their own lives. (There is un~
fortunately a large percentage of
students at Grinnell who actually
don't want lo be allowed freedom
and privacy and this obscures the
tact that everyone has the right to
these things alld that a person's
growth depends on thent)

When it comes down to it. rule»
breaking is a dead end, also. it
certainly doesn’t develop good
living habits. Students nre stuck.
Maybe that's why i keep running
into ex-Grinnell students here in
New York City, people who have
transferred to other schools to es-
cape m. impossible living situation.

There are many things I love
about Griunell, the proicssors, the
iriends i made lbcre, the land,
Now that rm an alumnu though,

Yule Log Ceremony
Lacking in Dignity

To the Editor:

Last Sunday evening the women
of South Campus celebrated the
50th anniversary of the Yule Log
dinner. Three years ago, when the
present seniors were impression-
able freshmen, Dean Gardner
spoke at the Yule Log ceremony.
She related to us. among other
things, the history or the Yllle Log
and told us that we would have the
opportunity to participate in the
golden anniversary of this tradition.
Main Lounge was so quiet during
her speech you could have heard
u pin drop. We are certain that lhe
senior Women will remember the
Poise and dignity with which both
the Ceremony and the dinner were
conducted.

How exactly then was the golden
anniversary of the Yule Log celer
bratetl this year? From the quad
dining rod... Came the resounding
notes of “Best Wishes to You.”
while in Gardner Lounge, raucous
laughter and the exclamation
"Santa Claus is dead"Y reverberat-
ed Ihl'oughoul the room.

We were very disappointed bv
the periormnnce. it isn’t that we
don't have a sense of humor, as a
Friday night iag sucll conduct
would have been great. But, there
is a time and a place [or awry-
thiug, and the Yule Log dinner
was neither the time nor the place.
We would hate to admit that Grln»
nell women have become so conr
pletely wrapped up in themselves
that they can no longer exert ~e
common courtesy toward 0|l\81'.
It formal dinners do not appeal to
you, you are entitled to your mum

to ours. and we believe there are
at least a iew who really appreci-
ate the once-a-year opportunity to

What’s the use of important pub-

oi Nov. 19 is a just complaint,

There’s no time as titting ior a
public event as 11 a m. The i um.
puhlic event cuts into an evening's
supper and sleep. A lecture from

11 to noon is not likely to upset
anyone's plans.

There are a dozen sets oi hours

(my definition or a university
or college) has common intcr.
csts. Ii these are ignored, one
has only an aggregation oi ins
dividuals.

2. The common interests rc-
quine each senior scholar (pro-
fessor) to make known his re-
search and conclusions and to
know the work of his col-
leagues.

3. The junior scholar (stu-
dent) deserves to know how
the contribution of each de~
partmcnt relates to that or
every other department,

4. 1f the taculty expects stu-
dents to nelate work done in
diiierent areas, but does not
do so themselves. they are
worse than hypocrites; they
are tailing to participate in the
exciting task of interpreting
the rclationship oi specialized
knowledge to man’s view of
himself and his world.

The President or Dean call dis
cuss‘ the “style of life" of the
community in a public assemhly.
Or, better, they can influence the
students' mode of life and thought
with interesting topics of debate.
The Administration deserves occa
Slons more frequent than the 0p»
ening oi the school year and Coni-
mellcement.

The division of fine arts has in-
terpreted its activities to the whole
community through the line arts
lectures. Thcsc lectures should he
so scheduled that all members of
the community might attend. I’ve
been to about to meetings, and as
I think hack over performances oi
the Lenox Quartet, Orchesis, etc,
and lectures by my colléagues, i
realize that this is an opportunity
for which I am deeply grateful. As
tor leading visiting'aestlleticlans.
i find few universities that have
had Rudolf Arnheim, Monroe
Beardsley. Lester Longman, Leon-
ard E. Meyer, and Paul Weiss dur-
ing the past four years.

I could say something similar a!
the Roseniield Lectures and the
Gates Lectures, but what this col-
lege is not now doing that it used
to do and should he doing is to get
its own faculty into dialogue with
each other.

The other day 5 sophomore

I spoke to me about Professor Wall's

statement, “modern man faces
chaos.” when 11:00 was tree for
public lectures I had heard Mr,
Wall's great lecture on “History
and Reality." The sophqmore has
my Thermotax copy, which seems
to he the only one remaining. It
was a great series on “Reality
with the departments oi psycho
lngy. chemistry, literature, history,
and philosophy represented. Facul-
ty members were exposed to each
other's questions. Students could
see thereby the strengths and
weaknesses of thc dilierent ap-
proaches. ‘

I should like to see tlus sort of
intellectual excitement at Grinnell
again. If there were the occasion oi
a taculty series, what fun it would
lie to hear James Kissalle and Say
mour Katz on myth. Mr. Kissanc
has published on “Vlcloﬂall My-
thology;" Mr. Katz has lectured on
Suzanne Langer's theory. I should
like to know what a classicist like
ilr. Crossett has to say. and to
hear an anthropologist like Mr.
Kurtz. Of course. I'd like to try
out some ideas of my own.

First Des Moines Rent Strike
Successf I, Two Others Foilow

By HENRY WILHELM

This week the ilrst rent strike
lupported by the Des Moines
Project ended successiully when
Mrs. Darlene Baker’s landlord, the
Winick Realty Company, agreed to
let her use the rent money that
she refused to pay because of the
condition of her house residence on

needed repair, most of which \vere
stated violations of the Des Moines
housing code, and presented it to
Winick. Among her complaints
were: the root had been leaking
for several months Causing plaster
to drop off the bathroom ceiling
and walls which clogged up the
sink and bathtub drains, the bath-

needed re- W,

pairs at 1068
Eighth Street in
Des Moines. _

Billy King, who
is working as a
community or-
ganizer in Des
Moines with the

group of inter-
ested students at
Grinnell, 5 a l d
that because of
the success of
this first strike,
two other houses
in the same area
have also re
fused to pay
their rent to
lh e i r landlord,
the Ryan Realty
Company, until
necessary

made.

Mrs. B a k e r,
who works at the

Des Moines, said
that she had been thinking about
refusing to pay her rent for some
time, even beiorevBilly talked to
her about it. She said that she Come
plained to her landlord repeatedly
concerning the condition of her
house; however, they made only
promises that they would take care
or things “as soon as they could,"

The Des Moines Project, on be-
half or Mrs. Baker, ﬁled a com-
plaint with the Des Moines Health
Department requesting that they
send an inspector to her house.
The inspector came but did not
file any condemnation notices; i

stead he “went to talk to Winick.” '

Sherry Robinson, head of the En-
vironmental Health Division later
said that "we don’t want to get
caught between any landlord and a
tenant in any argument That is
not our job.”

As the rent grew more past due,
Winick contacted Billy King and
arranged a meeting with him. Mrs.
Baker, and Winick’s lawyer, The
meeting. which was attended by
several Grinnell students who
have been working on the Project.

and after Winick's lawyer. Mr,
Kramer, looked at things and
talked about the complaints, an
agreement was reached that he
would tell Winick that certain
things ought to be repaired.

Later Winick, who owns about
13% of the houses in the area, told
Billy that Mrs. Baker could use all

mented that she “only did It be-
cause Sam (Winick) lied to me
when he said that he was going to
fix something.” She added, “1
work hard and my teet hurt every
day and 1 hate to pay someone
something that they didn’t earn.”

Mrs. Baker, who is separated
and lives With her teenage son,
said that she was prepared to move
elsewhere if evicted as Winick had
originally threatened to do if she
didn’t pay her rentr

Barbara Martinez, who lives

Whisper Into My Good Ear

Philosophy's Never-never Lancl

By MARY MALCOLM

Whisper Into My Good Ear will
he performed for the second time
tonight in the arena theatre at 8
pm.

Howard Harned doubles as
“Charlie” and iiha director of this
oneact play, alongside Bruce Mt:-
Conachie as “Max.”

'leo tired old men meet; on a
barely set stage: a rock, a tree,
a bench. The purpose or the meet-
ing turns out m be a double sui-
cide.

As an old man, neither McCon-
achie nor Harned is entirely cone
vineing. McConachte’s mincing
step and gentle smile are more
makerhelieva than old and worn—
out. Harned comes up with some
magnificent facial contortlons, but
doesn’t seem to know how to make
transitions.

However. as the dialogue be-
comes more dramatic, both cap-

lrure the essence or their roles.
The play ventures into philoso-
phy’s never-never land as two lost
and lonely men, wlilh their lives be
hind them, decide finally to live
lor “one more day.”

Max, a onetime homosexual and
Iallure as a painter, is more in»
tent on the contemplated suicide.
Life is a dream, he insists, "when
the hearL stops, the brain ends,
the dream ends. That is the only
certainty.” But Max can't take
the tinal step alone.

Charlie is going blind. He has
only a sordid past and lonely
present, with his wiie in an asy-
lum.

Max turns out to have two op—
posing objects in his pocket: a
gun and a pomegranate. The gun
is to die with. The pomegranate is
simply “One of Ilhe small pleas-
ures." Eating the pomegranate,
watching th lovers in the park,

thinking about boats on the lake
and‘ Christmas, Charlie decides to
initiate a kind of ”suicides anonyr
mous"—! don’t know about to-
morrow, but I just won’t kill my-
selitndny.

Max tries to take the ﬁnal step,
but ﬁnally succumbs to his own
homemade proverb: “The people
who are afraid to die are those
who have been afraid to live.”

The two head cheeriully Off to
get a cup or coffee at the automat.

This little play has a liberal
sprinkling or humor. although the
itinmest part at the dress rehear-
salia iew forgotten lines and
scramble for the script—hopelully
won't be repealed in the perfor—
mance. Combined with its random
and broad-based combination of
themes, the witty lines in whisper
Into My Good. Ear make Ior quite
a lot of thoughtiul entertainment
in an hour's time.

This system, Thurston feels, will
not allow questionable traditions to
be established, such as prepping
and lnterhall feuds.

The mental health facilities
available to students were critir

hope that Grinnell would expedite
the construction of a Powesheik

Thurston to need a few changes,
that being his special area or the

more unity in the organization

“It has come to our attention
that the Com? has been too pare
chial in its outllook,” said this
this year‘s president.

Thurston suggested that the prl~

es. Courtroom procedure would be
done away with, and would be
conducted in a "very informal.

concepts tor the iirst exam: 1)
the nature of man, 2) evaluation,
and 3) evidence. This test was
given twice, to 248 juniors in 1962
and 278 in 1963.

The faculty approved the new
theme on May 10, 1963, and re
lated the concept or “order" m
Aristotle, Newton, and Darwin.
With this test, four credits were
assigned for any passing grade,

The test centered on the Concept
of order was given in 1964 and
again in February 1961
4 Each year ditteient groups had
tried to tormulate meaninglul
tests, with varying degrees of suc»
cess,

Dean James Stauss questioned
the advisability of the exam in a
report to the iaculty on September
15, 1964. He said: “I find it dif-
ticuit to answer yes to three ques-
tions, where the afﬁrmative is
tied into the theory ol the exami-
nation:

“Does the amount or reading
which the students actually do jus-
tity the credits earned and taciilty
time and effort put into the exam?

“Do the essay questions in the
exam provide the students individ-
ually the oppoitunity to express
the particular reading each has
done?

“Are the concepts which have
interdisciplinary dimensions actual-
ly emphasized in the required
courses?'-’

Five months later, in February
1965, the faculty made its recom-
mendation that a one-year mora-
toriurn lie imposed, and that in
the future the JLA be considered
in conjunction with .a oomprehen
stve evaluation of the curriculum.

Kenyon K n o p i (economics),
chairman of the faculty, thinks
that the purpose at the morator-
ium is to “rethink the framework
rather than the examination.”

It a new test is designed, “per-
haps more structure will have to
be built in," although the test Was

originally proposed to test the lib-
eral arts, not course work. How
can the test he made part oi tho
curriculum and keep its “liberal
arts" flavor?

Stauss questioned whether the
“interdisciplinary concepts" were
actually made part of the course
work now. This same failure was
noted by Givens Thornton (psy~
nholngy), who made the turmai
proposal at line test in 1960.

“A substantial portion of the
faculty didn't accept the idea of
a liberal arts exam in principle"
and consequently tailed to give it
attention in course work and writ—
ing letters of recommendation

Thornton said, “I have no doubt
that the outcomes at a liberal edu-
cation can be measured," but that
currently the use of the exam
is an expensive proposition.

It is expensive in the sense at
time required or students, admin-
istration and particularly the fac-
ulty in the preparation and grad-
ing of the test.

On December 14, 1960, Thorns
ton’s proposal to the raoulty ra-
terred to the test in this way:
“It will have justiﬁed its exis-
tence if it promotes intellectual
excitement leading to discussion,
argument, and critical analysis oi
the issues basic to a liberal edu-
cation" and “cause students to
ask questions concerning Lhe puts
pose of a liberal arts college in
our society and their role in such
a community."

on those grounds, did it justiiy

No Reboumﬁ’ g Weak Offensive
leuo' Fa Two Basketball losses

By STEVE CASEY

The Pioneer basketball team,
showing a surprising inetticiency
in their ottense and a riot-sosur-
prising lack of rebounding, suc-
cumbed twice last weekend to
fair teams from Knox and Mon-
mouth. Knox whipped the Pio-
neers Friday, 62-55, and Mon-
mouoh ambushed them Saturday,
3369,

The Pioneers were outrebound—
Ed over the weekend 105-79 and
had a considerable number of
turnovers in their disappointing
openers The Pioneers were also
able to make only forty baskets
compared to seventy for their 01)-
position. Only deadly tree—throw
shooting (44 tor 54, 81 per cent)
kept the Pioneers in the games.

This weekend the Pioneers will
be trying to even their record as
they come back to Darhy to face
Lawrence tonight and Ripon to-
morrow. Lawrence also dropped
two last weekend, but Ripon
picked up two victories to tie tor
the conterence lead. Lawrence lost
to Carleton, 8881, and St, Olaf,
8579, while Ripon was beating
Carleton, 52-83, and St. Olaf, 85-
79.

With high hopes the Pioneers
went against Knox, which was
supposed to be one of the sailor
spols on the schedule. But the Si-
wash quickly jolted the Pioneers
by sprinting out to an early 2210
lead. Alter that the Pioneers were
never able to get closer than sev-
en paints to Knox. The Pioneers
crept to 22.15, but Knox pulled
away to a 3418 lead The hall
ended at 3815.

The Siwash combined a hustling
defense and an oiliense that
worked hard to get good shots to

 

keep the Pioneers at bay all night.

The second ham or the game was
similar to title rirsc as Knox kept
control or the boards and towed
the Pioneers into many bad pass
es. The hoopsters put forth n mild
challenge by drawing within seven
points with eight minutes remain
ing but were never able to get
closer than that

Even after the Knox game, the
Pioneers had high hopes oi get»
ting a split for the weekend. It
looked like they would as they
jumped out to a quick 16-9 lead
against an unorganized Monmouth
team. But the Scots called a time
out and regrouped their forces.
Monmouth then proceeded to reel
oil 14 straight points, many or
them giits because Di poor Pioneer
passes, to lake a me lead. The
Pioneers were only able to pick
up a pair at free throws as the
Scots continued on to build a 31-18
lead. The halI ended at 43-32.

The Pioneers, though, came out

surprise the Scots like they did
at the start of the game. They
looked for a while like they would
succeed In the ilrst three min-
utes the hoopsters reeled oft nine
points to draw within two point:
