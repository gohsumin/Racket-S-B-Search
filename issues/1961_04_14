The Dunner Lelle

Dr J scph Dunner's letter, (see letters to the edit '
collided by all "oye eadiue" ol' tlle 5&1} editol l,
‘ l'ttrlzllKl Let Us See Fill Ourselves” and by all
’ .ng’ly naive acceptance ol' the state department line.

The editorial. we think, was a mild one The noticor
I! hick ol‘ baclk mind was based on the a lmptiou
that both Sides oi the Cuban question had just been
thoroughly discussed at the, Latin American conference.

Because, however, there still appeals to be some
co'll'll.'oll. we are discussing Dr. Dunner's letter heie, ill
hopes ol cla ng' our oi ginal position.

One poillt must he made cle’ '. At no time did this
paper unoualii‘i nlev endolse the actions of Fidel Castro
or the revolutionary government. We view the revoluv‘
tilill a inevitable; we do not agree witll many (it its
methods or \\'\i.l]*‘ 11 ot its philosophy. We, like Di. Dunner,
are concerned with tile p '_ it of the Cuban people, alld
even mole important, with the strange attitudes which
seem to lead the United States tom one diplomatic blink
der to the next. Most important, we do not take a clear
cut motion in the matter because as we see it, the l'acts
simply are not all iii.

A desire to know the facts w a chief re n for

illg' the editorial We do not like the government
policy of increased sec ecy. We don’t like it ill HUAC; we
don‘t like it in the FBI or the CIA, and we cerainly
don't 1 e it ill Clba. Government rele ' ', and the pr '
( -ept in a few olated cases) have shown only one side
01 the picture \lh any side was shown at all.

if the situation ill Cuba were as horribly black and
white as the Nazi terror in Germany to which Dr. Dane
ner compares it, a strong position would be easy to take.
But more than a few reports just don't concur with the
position Dunner advocates.

Among these are reports heard from the group of ,i'iiakc sure “that the Cuban peo-

1;‘ilt persons who went to Cuba ji t a month before the
tlavel ban was imposed. According to tlielll, conditions
for the Cuban people (the greatest number of whom don't
consider themselves “r lied in dictatorship” are incom—
pal ible with what they were dur g the year of Batis
Shacks have become homes with indoor plumbing; schools
are being built.

Dr. Dunner also implies that visitors who speak
against the new Cuban government will be punished with—
out appeal. Isn’t this also when the case in lands ruled
by men such as Franco, DeGaulle and Truiillo'.7 Where is
Dr, Dunner’s demand for travel bans on those countries?
A revolutionary government is bound to be extra careful
ullt-il it stands on firmer ground. Many Tories, he may ier
call. ill our own revolution had to take to the hills. Mr.
Shapiro who was detained in Cuba and released seemed
not the worse for near, and still open-minded about the
("uhail s tuation.

That the Commun ts are Cuba's t' ends hardly
a wonder when we tied to win l'ricnd'llip ll) cutting ofi'r
their supply of dollars 'and loweril the .inal' quota,
when we are consistently over-conscious of our own ill-
tele. s and unconcerned with those of Cuba. The “utimiilh
iy'tion of industry in Cuba was made only after yeal
in tor the United States businessman, alld year of
' for many lower class Cubans. Some prool' at this is
evident in the fact that Ameri ill busin men were not
willing to accept the Cuban government's ol'l'ei' of pay-
him”. l'or their industries 2 cording to the prices they had
quoted as the industry's Value on tax returns.

The, state department notice that we were witlidral
in! the sugar quota because of United States need is \‘el,
hard to believe, especially nice we be me needy at such
n convenient time. Tile treatment C2 tro received dilrilllr
his United State' visit, likewise. will never win the U. S.
alii' medals for diplomacy. lll Cuba the commui
still the )position party, but it it is becoming lncrea‘
ii, dill cult to d tillg'uisll between the revolutiollal_
and the Commil "t, it is not the l'ault oi the ll‘ail' Play for
('uhll Committee as Dr. Dilullor implies, but. rather the
l'alllt lil' t‘ cilill anee alld a long history of bilttel'efingzereli
llilillilllatic polil

'i'liotlg’ll Dr. Dunner's letter has t'erced us into (le-
lelidilip‘ a po. ti we are not ready to del'elld, it has
helped to illdic te the l'a ’ous contradicto reports alld
attitudes that are presently lielit hle when real l'acth can-

Dr. Dullncr may show ‘us state department comments
and Dulllleiustatelnonts, and we will show him Mill's inter-

Dunner Discusses Cuba

Cont, from p. 2

“It is my hope and my con-
viction that in the not too
distant iuturc it will be 17057
sible ior the historic iriend-
ship, hetueen us, once again to
iind its reilection in normal,
relations oi every Sort. Mean-
whilc, our sympathy goes out
to the people oi Cuba now
suffering under the yoke oi
a dictator."

I tor one, can not detect in
Mr, Eisenhower's statement a
“policy oi hostility toward Cu-
ba," to the Cuban people. On
Jan. 16, 1961, the Department
oi stale announced “that in
view of the u, s. governincnt‘s'
inability. following the break in
diplomatic relations between the
United statcs and Cuba, to ex-
tend noinial protective services
to Ameiicans visiting Cuba, Us,
citizens desiring to go to
Cuba niusl, until further 110»
ticc, obtain passports speciiically
endorsed by the Department oi
Slate ioi- such travel. . .cxcep—
tions to thesc regulations will
be granted to persons whose
travel may regarded as be-
ing in the best interests or the
United States, such as newsmen
or businessmen with previously
established business interests. . ,

“These actions have been.
taken in coniorinity with the
department’s normal practice
oi limiting travel to those
countries with which th e
United states does not mainr
tnin diplomatic delations."
Notice that during several
months preceding the issuance
of what amounts to a “limited
travel ban," such as was Impose
ed on the travel or United
States citizens to Nazi Germany
when similar conditions had an
risen there. U, S. citizens in
Cuba had been sentenced to
heavy prison penalties by “Re-
volutionary Tribunals" without
having been granted an oppor-
tunity to confer with the (line
lomatic representation of the
US, in Cuba or the Swiss Logan
tion which, at the request oi
the U. 5 Government. had as
greed to represent U. s. inter»
ests in Cuba.

In this respect, it should he
made clear that aliens are sub-
ject to the laws oi the coun-
try in which they happen to
be. But, it the humarcollntry
oi the alien can claim “denial
of justice" or “deficiency in
the administration or the judie
cial or remedial process," it
is entitled to submit the issue
to govenimental negotiation.
In the Cuban case, such dipr
Jomatic settlement has become
nearly impossible, as the lions
disputes by arbitration or re
course to the world court (now
the International Court oi JllSv
tice).

Consequently, the U S. gov-1
ernmcnt is conlrontcd with the‘
choice oi warrllkc measures in
behalf oi those citizens, who,
ior one reason or another. have
been suhiect to “denial ot ju
lice" or the is- iance oi a warn-
int,r to its citizens lhai by going.
In a country like Cuha they,
loose the customary protection
oi the U 5. Government,

Ii the editor or other "inn
terested students" want to
take this risk, a number, oi
ways are open to, them to see .
“Cristi—01mm" ior themselves l
Ii they, however, want to “be
truly American" in presenlrday
Cuba and state their views
there as irankly as thcy are
accustomed to doing on th e,
Gi-innell campus and through
out the United states. they willi
do well to let their parents and‘

Both the Cditur and the readers
ot‘ the 5&3 might. howcvcr, tsk
whether or not it was the US,
government which, by its own
policies, might have produced the
deterioration of relationships has
tween the present government oi
Cuba and the us. and, ior exr
nmple. suggest 7 what the “per
tition" docsithat it was the US.
government which hampcrcd‘
American trade relations with
Cuba. Let me again quote '4 rl»
lease of the State Department
which speaks for itse][

On Oct. 15), 1360, two and one
half nmnlhs before Cubll issued
its ultimatum, the State Dev
pal-tmellt: “Over the course oi
the past 21 months the United
States has been subjected hy
the Castro regime to all '
creasing campaign of host
and slander.

“Accompanying its words wilh
actions. the goveininent ot‘ Cuba
instituted zl SL‘I of orbitraly

twmic measures which have my
lut‘Cd thousands of American
citizens and have drastically ale
tcrcd the hitherto mutudlly bent”
[iclal pattern of trdde betnecn
the United States and Cuba,”

Illuotl‘allVC of what has hdpr
pened is the iact that the more
ment of the United States exports
to Cuba has been reduced to less
than 50 percent of the figure in
1958, and that came to power.
Meanwhile, Cuban exports to
the United Slates remained nor-
mal until July of this year, when
it became necessary to reduce the
Cuban sugar quotato provide fol"

pal incasureses taken by the gov-
ernmcnt of Cuba aimed at rcduc-,
ing the movement oI goods and

to Cuba are listed below.

None of these measures can
he iustiiicd- hy a need to con-
serve ioreign exchange rec

ban government oiiirials, are ‘
adequate. Rather they are the
result oi a deliberate political i
