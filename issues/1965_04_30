CHIP ctAiiiiE. righi, is among the group of students from enmeii who helped with sand-
bagging operations at the Centennial Bridge overfha Mississippi River at Rock island, iii.

Island, Il1., while helping build
a major secondary dike, they
saw “nothing but flocks of kids
who had come out of the slums
looking for great fun. There
was little organization and
little being done.”

Fisk said, “At one point I
Walked up to a man who looked
like an official and gave him
some advice on What should be
done, Subsequently it was
pointed out to me that he was
the city manager and head of
the flood control project, But
he took my advice.”

The four Grinnellians went
to the city hall for a briefing

 

of the flood control operations
After complaining about lack of
organization, they were asked
to take charge of the city’s
sandbagging operations. The
Grinnellians declined this re-
sponsibility.

“After looking at the kids
and working with them for a
short time, we felt the under
taking was too large for us,"
Fisk said.“‘l‘here were too
many 15 and lﬁryearrold kids
from the water front slums
looking for a spree, and not
enough wanting to do any hon-
est work,"

The four spent two hours

 

Walker, Bells Examine Role of College
In Providing Negroes with Education

By Pain Clay

The respnnsibiiity of institutions
such as Grinnell for Negro educa<
tion was the topic of the ﬁnal dis-
cussion in the Board oi Religion’s
series on the race problem Tiles-
day,

Waldo Walker, associate dean of
the college, enumerated three cri-
teria which have been used in past
years to determine the admission
of a student to Gi‘innell and other
colleges, These were: 1) his aca-
demic ability, 2) his financial sit-
uation, and 3) his social accept-
ability. “At least one of these,"
Walker said, "usually exempted
the Negro from attendance.”

At present a great change hasi
coma about. There are various
ways to aid “Culturally disadvana
taged" students ill overcoming the

three problems Some colleges and
other institutions offer summer
preparatory programs or remedi-
al aid, Money is being poured in-
to financial aid programs.
Raymund Betts (history). the
second speaker, emphasized that
the white intellectual must com-
pensate fnr his forebears and him-
self, quickly and intensively.
This must be accomplished at all
levels. For, while collegerlevel
progress is most immediately ap-
parent, it does neither the most
profound nor lasting good. Help
must begin at the kindergarten
and preschool levels, Betts said.
The double concern is to recruit
Negroes, as at Grinnell, and to

Drinking Case
Goes lo Couri'

By Alan Axelmd

The first case to be heard by the
newly appointed Men’s Primary
Court spotlighted the nebulous na—
ture of the college drinking policy.

The verdict will be amounced
within the next three days,

The Tuesday night case involved
a Dibble freshman caught by city
police walking the streets intoxi-
cated. The police did not formally
charge the Student but turned him
over to 3. Eugene Thompson, dean
of men, who “put him to bed."

The student was charged with
violation of the general conduct
policy in the preamble to the
Men's House Rules.

Defense counsel Gerald Goddard
revealed that Thompson had told
the student he “did not consider
it a serious offense." Thompson
said, “However, I wouldn’t want
anybody to go away thinking that
it is a contradiction that the stu-
dent was brought to court.” He
said the student was not behaving
in a disorderly manner and that
would weigh in the case.

In his final statement, Goddard
said, “I do not think that pre-
ambles can replace codification of
laws and established procedure."

Roberts Rules Of Disorder

College, as admissions oﬂicers are fond of
saying at college night dinners, is a search. My ed-
ucation. too, is a search. My search is for a T-
equare, a right angle. i needed to be ahle to draw
it straight line at right angles to a piece at paper
to plan the current issue of the 553. We generally

‘ have printed forms for that purpose — terms that
we import trim a world where right angles and
straight lines are not alien.

"John," I said to my editor. “John. where is
the T-square?”

“T-square7" he said lncredlllously. “We don’t
have a T~square. What do you need a T—square for?"

"For page layout,"

“Oh, my God, are we cut or those printed terms
that we import trom a world where right angles
and straight lines are not alien?" Anyway, he
directed me to the art building.

I found one of the art professors standing bliss-
tully in north light carefully studying a painting
he was working on. It looked for all the world
like therapy for a manic depressive. Seeing me,
he shouted, "Quick, over here. i need your hand."

Well, of course I rushed forward, hand extend-
ed.

“on, those bony lingers, the deathlike appear—
ance or them. Pei-loot.” I was flattered. “Here,
put your hand here and then move it slowly down
the canvas to about here.” i tried.

“You boob, you stupid. muddlehended, in-
sensitive moron. Look What you did, you moved it
too far to the lett." l was busy wiping my paint-
covered hand on a piece of scrap canvas and didn’t
catch the next series of names he called me. Fi~
nally, when he had calmed to the quiet stammering
stage I managed to squeeze in . . .

“Do you hsve a T-sqllare, a right angle?"

He looked really hurt. "A T-square, a right
angle? You jerk. The Grinnell art department doesn't
use T—squares or right angles. Those are tor straight
lines and earners and nothing like that appears
here."

As I left, disappomted, he was lovingly studying
the scrap or canvas 1 had wiped my hands on.

My next stop was the science buildingr “Sure,"
said ll friendly, acid-stained met, “We have lots
of Trsquares, Follow me." I followed him through a
labyrinth of rooms tilled with test tubes, wires,
scales and pale, hungry looking students.

“What are those pale, hungry-looking students?”
I risked. /

“Oh those,” he laughed. "Some chem students
of mine who’ve been trying to find unknowns in
distilled water for three weeks." He laughed hideous-
ly. “Here they are. Now you can borrow this one

Pass-Fail

We would like to suggest that the faculty, admini-
stration, and students of Grinnell College do something
original and work toward establishment of a wide«
ranging pass~fail grading system.

The system is self explanatory; a student would be
given one of two grades — pass or fail. This would be
the penultimate in grading plans and would supplant
the many varieties of number and letter systems. The
final step, of course, would be no grades, but it seems
that you just don’t get your $2,600 worth if you don’t
get a card with some grade notation on it.

Carleton has recently extended a pass-fail system
to “courses for which the conventional grading system
might be deemed inappropriate.” This would include
courses like creative writing, studio art, and advanced
seminars.

Earlier, Carleton had given (and still gives) its
students the option of taking one course per semester
on the pass-fail plan. This system is designed to allow
students to take courses outside their majors without
fear of hurting their grade-point averages.

When Carleton instituted the pass-fail system,
concerned people there saw growing out of the normal
letter grading system, a “social estrangement which
. resulted from the excessive competition for grades
in course work," One faculty member felt that the
new system was potentially of special benefit to “a
small, somewhat geographically isolated, residential
college like Carleton (which can‘t be more isolated
than Grinnell) in relieving that “social estrangementr”

While it may be argued that Grinnell needn’t fol-
low Carleton in every step it takes, it is not pleasant
that a school which purports to be a leading liberal
arts college in the country generally waits for other
schools to do the experimenting in matters of higher
import than liberal arts examinations for juniors.

Carleton is not the only school experimenting
with pass-fail, Washington University in St. Louis is
studying the possibilities of such a plan San Jose State
in California offers its freshmen a modified rio-grade
tutorial system. The California Institute of Technology
has established a pass-fail system for freshmen to ease
freshman transition into college life.

We would like to suggest that the established sys-
tem of grade-giving is proving a big drawback in every
area except, perhaps, in a student’s major. Retention of
the standard grading system for studentsY areas of coil-
centration should satisfy those who argue that the new
system might endanger admission into graduate school,
since a student’s major grades are presumably the most
important part of his transcript.

It has been mentioned, too, that a pass-fail system
might lessen motivation, Unfortunately, the present
system stresses motivation for grade-grabbing rather
than for learning a subject well because it is a subject
the students want to learn,

As a Carleton professor noted, with the establish-
ment of a pass-fail grading system, “the pressure to
obtain the reward of a better grade might well be re-
placed by the challenge of an opportunity to master or
to sample as much of the knowable as one is able, while
probing, as a genuine community of scholars, more
.dceply and more widely into unknown areas. This
would be a refreshing environment in which to live,"

The drawbacks of the present system become more
apparent as mounting enrollments throughout the coun»
try cause increased competition that may not be ap—
parent to administrators in their lofty positions or to
l the students who have no choice but ’to accept the com-
petition cr lose the status that their hard-fought-for
700 plus board scores gave them.

Our proposal, then, would be for Grinnell to set up
a pass-fail grading system for all subjects except those
in a student's major. We understand that informal di
cussion among faculty members on the matter of grad-
ing systems is perennial; we would urge formal dis—
icussions by faculty, administration, and students.

It is time to work out a realistic means of imple-
;menting a pass-fail grading system, and there is no
reason why Grinnell shouldn’t. be a leader in this area.

Beeman Sees Intellectual Potential
In More Faculty-Student Contact

To the Editor:

Just today a list canto into my
hands that was compiled earlier
in the year by the Board ot ite-
ligion. For some reason it was
never distributed to the student
body, at least to my knowledge.

I don’t know how the list was
compiled or what the circum-
stances were that motivated those
who undertook making it up, but
i do know that in the idea behind
its being drawn up is the remedy
tor a problem that exists now on
the Grinnell campus.

Quite simply the list consists of
members of the taculty who would
\he willing to entertain students. or
just talk and discuss with them
outside of the classroom. Beside
many of the names are listed in-
terests that these people have,
ranging from Indians of the South-
west to astronomy.

Freshmen arriving on campus
must really feel cheated to tind
the sad state or attairs that stu-
dent-iaculty relations are in out:
side of the classroom. For the
most part, the contact students
have with their instructors is
limited to the three or four hours
they spend in class with him or
her each week. Somewhere there
is a ritt that keeps any further
Contact from evel‘ developing.
Even in the new Forum one
notices immediately two segregat-
ed groups of coffee drinkers 7
inc lty and students. The recent
serlea of student-few v coffees
un Thursday and Friday after
noons which were designed to
break down this barrier have been
[or the most part total flops in
this respect. Only two or three
taculty members ever show up
at all (despite the fact that simul-
taneously, large groups of them
are paying for their coffee and
segregating themselves in a cor-
ner ot the grill). Even the few
brave souls who do come rarely
return.

students don’t help bridge
this gap either. Too ottcn anyone
who is seen talking to a protessor
is accused of “lll'owmnosmg” or
trying to pad his gradepoint. In
cynical society of his peers it
can‘t be understood that he or
she might really like the man
and have a genuine interest in
his opinions on a subject. We have
some of the finest academic
minds in the country here at Grin»
noll, as well as a student body
selected on the basis 01 their in-
tellectual drive, among other
things, The two in conjunction
with each other could create a
real academic atmosphere 7 not
one that quits tunctioning as soor.
as classes are over on Saturday.

The result could bring some real

We must realize that even in

way to dorthls (also the cheapest)

docs not mean that because i like

happens that folk music irritates
me. Am 1 then a lesser person

Yet, variance of taste is not the
question. The real point is an as-

tool that because i am unable to

I am a crass and superficial crea-

pears to assume that he knows
something about liie that I do
not.

Lighthoul‘ne’s column is clotted
with a ludicrous irony (it irony
can he ludicrous), As a member-

his enlightened tolerance, That tol~
erance is purportedly hascd on the
realization that a person's clothing,
economic status and mannerisms,

Some companies are doing it

would pay $500 for each preg—

was first suggested by a Cana-

A Cornell University coed

raigned on marijuana charges
arising from an investigation

were released without bail in
the custody of their attorneys
pending further action.

Unidentified thieves caused
a temporary panic at Carleton
College by stealing d'le sign-out
cards from all major women’s
dormitories. When the theft
was discovered, it was ana
nounced that all girls would be
campused until the cards were
returned, and doors locked at
6:30. The student Action Party
immediately scheduled a twen~
Ly-minute protest meeting be-

ever, the clean of women an-
nounced that the remains of
the cards had been found in a

added that there would be no

would prevail that night, and
that new cards would be issued.

their unwanted children for four
years, the Parsons Portfolio de-
clared in part, “About three
years ago this may have been

academic trouble is no cause
for alarm.“

Fifty Yale students held a
seventyatwo hour picket of the
university administration build~
ing recently to protest the
“publish or perish” attitude of
the Yale Tenure Appointment
Committee. The demonstration
was a result of tenure being
denied to R. J. Bernstein, as-
sociate professor of philosophy.
Bernstein, 32, has publislled one
book, another about to be pub-
lished, and is working on a
third. One member of the phil-
osophy department said, “Un-
der the criteria of publications
that were used for Bernstein,
we could not have gotten tenure
for Aristotle when he was 32."

Slaus—s Describes
Tenure al Grinnell

ln light of the recent dem-
onstrations at Yale over the
tenure system, the 5&3 looked '
into the tenure situation here at
Grinnellr

Acting President J a m e s
Stauss said that there is a ten<
ure system at Grinnell, but that
there aren’t any formula-like
for assigning ten/-
ure.

“Tenure comes on the basis
of a system of recommenda-
tions and must be approved by
the Board of Trustees," Stauss
said. I

“Many faculty members en-
gage in scholarly activities,
and this is a factor in the con-
sideration for tenure," Stauss
continued. He stressed, how-
ever, that there is no "publish
or perish" policy at Grinnell.

Tenure means that a faculty
member has a permanent p0~
sition at Grinnell.

Brogan Views Quaint Grinnell

“Grinnell r . . is set in the little
town of Grinnell and is, in tact,
the main and almost only eco-
nomic justification for the exist»
ence of the town." so said Sir
Denis Brogan (now returned to
civilization) about his home for
three months last year.

Brogan authored an article about
(.vl'innell town and college which
was featured in the Feb. 13 issue
of a Glasgow, Scotland, newspa-
per and which round itselr appear
ing in the Grinnell Herald Register
(a “parochial” newspaper, but re-
minding Brogan of the “Rutherv
glen Reformer” of his youth) on
April 15.

The article concluded by claim»
ing that “either Main Street was
not as bad as Sinclair Lewis pre»
tended or it has vastly improved in
the last 40 years.

in reading the feature, the Grin-
nellian is often led to wonder why
Brogan feels there has been any

 

progress, but can only conclude

that what might be taken as criti—
cisms by lowa pioneers are actual-
ly endear-ments to the ruddy gen-
tleman from the Old World

Brogan noted that his proposed
stay in the backwoods probably
caused a stir in the civilized world
and that “sophisticated friends in
Washington or San Francisco or
New York would have been no
more surprised if we had gone to
the Congo than to rural Iowa."

Brogan did have some sympathy
with the college’s primitive archi»
tectural makeup. “The campus
contains buildings of every style,
from the must atrocious Victorian
bogus Romanesque to extremely
elegant modern Bauhaus construc-
Lions."

But-ling library‘s.stock (not the
colonial kind) was Considered good,
“by our (British) standards."

According to Brogan, the col-
lege has antiquated customs re-
garding the sexes. He observed.
“Grinnell segregates them much

more severely than Oxford or Cam-
bridge now do.”

The town itself “is in What the
Americans would call ‘a blind' "
because of the business loss caused
by Interstate 30. Further, “it is
not surprising that they (towns-
people) Ere the main supporters of
Goldwaterism."

And as a tender, understanding
note, Brogan mentioned that “there
were rather touching examples of
the desire to build up the local
‘merchant’ class. Every shop and
store had a label on the door read-
ing either ‘Push for Grinnell’ or
‘Pull lor Grinnell,’ depending on
how the doors opened and shut."

Even the borbarism hasn’t been
removed from the frontier. To be
sure, “there was crime in various
parts of the state, if not in Grine
nell, a good deal or embezzlement,
a good deal of drunkenness ending
in violence and sometimes in
death, a certain amount of hi-
jacking, and even something or the
vice which Macauley optimistical-
ly said ‘satire blushes to name.’ ”

But Brogan held some hope tor
the Midwestern wilderness. The
people, he says, are lriendly, the
Dutch Elm disease hasn’t gotten
to Grinnell yet, the land is prob-
ably as rich as that of East Loth-

Lion and East Anglia, the settlers
, seem remarkably sane in compari-

sion with those of Southern Cali-
fornia, “and the people at lowa
have recently begun the experi-
ment or allowing the sale of spirits
by the drink . . ."

Production of ‘Tea & Sympathy'
Demonstrates Director's Talents

By Don Kurasch

Bruce McConachie is a tal-
ented young man. The presi-
dent oi the Grinnell Players
has previously proved his abil-
ity as an actor, and alter this
week's production of Robert
Anderson's Tea and Sympathy
has shown a deft capacity for
directing.

The most remarkable aspect
of McConachie’s effort was his
handling of the set. The bi-ievel
structure was elaborate, yet
tastefully appropriate, and
made the fullest possible use of
the limited space in Arena The-
atre. But for a few seats on
the side, which were partially
cut oil by a large table lamp.
there were no bad places to sit
within the semicircular ar-
rangement of the audience.

In the roles of Bill and Laura
Reynolds, Howie Harned and
Georgia Mickey worked well
together, The irreconcilable
conflict between the two was
clear—Hamed as the unyield-
ing schoolmaster, afraid that
the “queerness” he thought he
saw in one of his students might
be part of his own nature, and
Miss Mickey as the sympathec
ic Wife who understood her hus-
band, but who was unable to
penetrate the shell he had
drawn over himself. Perhaps

 

Harned could have varied the
delivery of his lines some, and
have come out a little less one-
dimensiunal, and Miss Mickey
might have tried letting her
arms leave her sides occasion—
ally, but in general the two
were strong, and periodically
dramatic.

As the unjustly accused Ton-i
Lee, Dan Burns came across
as the sensitive, misunderstood
student. Though there may have
been some difficulty in deter-
mining how much of the ob-
vious nervousness was Eurns',
and how much was part of the
characterization, he did suc—
ceed in creating a feeling of
general sympathy with his
problems.

The two most consistent and
effective characters in the play
were Lilly Sears, played by
Judy Ginsberg, and Al, played
by Dan Mason. Miss Ginsberg
made the most other small part
as the tastefully vivacious flirt,
and Mason was perfect as the
rocky, understanding room-
mate.

There were a few lines
“dropped," a few “thrown
away,” and several technical
fluffs, but overall, the play
was very enjoyable And the
producing and directing job by
McConachie was truly note-
worthy.

His t o i- i c “Wingspread,”
known as the largest and most
dramatic of F r a n k Lloyd
Wright‘s “prairie h o u s e 5,"
formed the backdrop for the
Associated Colleges of the Mid—
west Student Conference on the
Problem of the Metropolis. Five
Grinnell students selected from
the Various social science de-
partments participated in the
conference which was held last
Friday and Saturday near Ra-
cine. Wisconsin.

The Grinnell contingent to
the conference included Gerald
H s n s o n. economics; Jerri
Hart, sociology; David Light-
boume, American studies: and
K a t h r y n Serrill, sociology.
Elizabeth Borders, a German
major, who will take part in the

Students from each or the

Professors Attend
Science Conference

Twelve Grinneli professors
attended the annual Iowa Acad~
emy of Science meeting held
in Dubuque last Friday and
Saturday. They were (biology)
Waldo Walker, Ben Graham,
La Verne Durkee, George Rob—
ertson; (physics) Grant Gale;
(chemistry) William O elk‘e,
Luther Erickson, Joseph Dan-
tortl-i; (psychology) Neil Kent,
D, Winfred Tyler; (mathemat-
ics) Lyle Pursell, and Edgar
Mullins.

Durkee chaired the botany
section at the meeting, and Kent
supervised the psychology sec-
tion. Erickson, Mullins, Gale,
Kent, Tyler, Robertson, and
Guillermo Mendoza (biology)
presented papers in their spe-
cial fields. Grinnell students
who presented papers in the
psychology section were Mar-
garet Dunn, Ron Wood, Hertha
Farmer, Neal Viemeister and
Jean Pierce.

Asked his impression of the
meeting, Robertson said that
“the overall program was
pretty good. It gave scientists
from different institutions a,
chance to get together and to.
present research findings be-
lore an audience. This is a val-,
uable experience.” i

Durkee believed attendance
might have been lessened byl

To the Editor:

it was really disgusting to turn
to the sports page of the Scarlet is.
Black of April 23, loss. There
were many things to be dismayed
at, hut the prime journalistic
boner was the column, “Scarlet
Fever.” We shall enumerate some
at the iirst class errors iirst, how-
ever.

The headline of the track Ax»
ticle read, “Relay Teams Lead
Trackmaii at Drake.” The article
went on to tell how the Pioneer
track team had been led at the
State College of iowa's Dickinson
Relays hy their relay team. Fi~
nally at the end of the article
there was i half a sentence telling

Drake Relays that weekend, but
this surely could not have been
what the headline had been re-
lcrring to, at least not in the
manner in which it was stated.

It has came to my attention that
some people are in disfavor with
my article of last week. which is
all right in itself. but most of them
have misinterpreted the point of
the article, or, more specifically,
one paragraph.

The purpose of this column is
not indiscriminately to criticize
Grinnell athletes and is certainly
not to criticize individual Grinnell
athletes. Its real purpose is to
point out weaknesses in the Grin-
nell sports system. The views 1
take are originally purely my
own, but I have found a great ma-
jority agree with me.

In my experience with college
baseball and other baseball of
similar calibre, it has always
seemed advantageous for the mana
ager or one of his assistants to
coach third base. For from third
base he can keep a tight control
on the game with the signs he
gives to the batters, his signals to
the baserunners, and so forth.

So Morgan Michel was actually
a victim of circumstances. He
happened to be the third base
coach when I was watching the
game. What I said in the article
was that no one but coach Piitsch
or another coach should be on
third.

From the baseball team I have
heard Morgan is now an assistant
coach and so is capable of taking
the responsibilities of the third
base coach. I send my congratula-
tions,

Now if some people question oth-
er parts of the article, they can
bring up their questions with me,
and, if necessary, ! may spend the
last month of the school year ex-
plaining my ideas.

As for this week's article, I am
sure glad that Morgan himself has
a cooler head than some other
people, especially two of his
friends who visited me last Friday
night, or i would probably be in
no shape to write this article now.

in a bitter letter I received Wed-
nesday, signed by The Baseball
Team — although i highly doubt
everyone had a part in this — it
was suggested among other things
that I should perhaps transfer to
Monmouth or maybe become a
coach next year.

Unfortunately I have already
paid my $50 and am planning to
draw for a room next Monday.
And I am sure the sports budget
would not allow another coach,

If the authors of the letter would
like to use their ability to write
baseball stories, instead of criticiz-
ing them, we would all probably
be happier. For i know an actual
player can always get a better in-
sight intu the game than a report-
er can.

I also know that if the team
spends as much energy against its
opponents as it did in this letter,
it will be getting many hits and
will really be tough for the rest
of the year. Let's hope they can.

stitutes, 2) cooperation with Negro
colleges such as LeMoyne, 3) send-
ing faculty members out to other
institutions, 4) a crash program
for the Negroes in this area of the
country to help them learn the
basic R’s.

“The true tragedy," Betts con-
cluded. “is that we have to single
out the Negro in discussing educa-
tion."

We must convince Negro stu-
dents and parents of the value of
a liberal arts education which of-
fers the luxury of an affluent so-
ciety, Betts said. The utility of
this education is not measured in
figures,

Grinnell has been amazingly suc-
cessful in attracting academically
qualified Negroes. ”You have no
idea what the battle is on the mar-
ket right now!" Walker explained.

Kissane Publishes

“Tennyson: The Passion of
the Past and the Curse of
Time,” an article by James
Kissane (English) appears in
the March issue of the “Jour-
nal or English Literary His-
tory.”

Kissane’s essay examines the
Victorian poet laureate‘s sense
of time as it dominates much
of his important poetry.

Women's IM's

“Assets for Leadership" was
the theme of the twentieth Na-
tional Conference of the Ath-
letic and Recreation Federation
of College Women held in Lin-
coln, Nebraska, April 11.14.
Four Grinnell women, LeAnne
Hoepner, Lynne Stoelting, Vicki
Crandall, and Rin Yeisiey, at-
tended the convention accom-
panied by"Mis‘s Joyce Buck,
adviser to WRA hero on camps
us.

Participants in the confer-
ence included 260 persons from
27 states. Time was divided be
tween speakers and workshops.
During ohe workshops prob-
lems of WRA's at the local level
were discussed. It was learned
at the conference that in most
schools all women students au-
tomatically become members
of WRA with their enrollment
in the school. It was also found
that funds for operation of
WRA in these schools comes
from the activity fee.

According to Rin Yeisley,
president of WRA at Grinnell,
the Conference "proved Val-
uable no the individual and has
the potential of being Valuable
to the local organization.” Its
main worth in presenting an
opportunity for a large amount
exchange among students and
among advisers.
