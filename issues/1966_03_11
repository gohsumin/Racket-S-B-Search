Faculty Approves Proposals:
Ad Hoc Committee Formed

At Monday’s faculty meeting,
the Executive Council's recommem
dations to the ad hoc committee
on the North Campus problem were
approved. According to laculty
members present one ieature oi
the proposals is to have students
on North Campus paid to enforce
rules,

These recommendations are not
final, however. They go to an ad
boo committee which will discuss
them and then make ﬁnal recom-
mendations to President Leggett.
Leggett said yesterday that he will
approve Steve Kent, Bob Foote,
Karen Lauterbach, Henry~York
Steiner (English), Luther Erickson
(chemistry) and R. Homer Norton
(history) as members of the com-
mittee. The committee will be
chaired by Richard Winters, asso-
clate dean of the College.

The Council's suggestions have
not been released formally to the
student body. The iaculty and ad-
ministration members involved are
willing to release the material but
the student members want to wait
until after spring vacation so that
they can go from hall to ball to
explain the faculty’s proposals.

”As a whole," said one faculty
member, “the proposals were not
radical." Another facility member
told the 5&3 that the recommenda-
tions are “relatively mild” but
that they “involve change and
when you're reactionary any
change looks radical.”

FORUM HOURS

Mrs, Jewel l-iawk, director of
the Forum, has announced that
the Forum will close tomorrow
at 3 pm for Spring vacation
The grill Closes tomorrow at 2
pm

The Forum will reopen Stin-
day, March 27 at 4 p.1n. The
grill will open that same day at
5 pm

 

President Leggett said yesterday
that he was planning a convoca-
tion for sometime soon after spring
vacation, perhaps the ﬁrst week in
April. He Said that he and the new
student government officials would
take part in the convocation and
that the North Campus problem
would be one of the topics dis-
cussed.

Focuiiy Elects Wall

The faculty announced yester-
day that they have elected Joseph
Wall (history) to a two year term
as chairman of the faculty. He
succeeds Kenyon Knopf (econom-
ics) in that position. Wall takes
over that post in September.

majoring in history.

The official announcement of the
Scholars was made Tuesday by the
Woodrow Wilson National Fellow
ship Foundation.

The Wilson Fellowship provides
tor one academic year of graduate
education for potential college
teachers, provides a living stipend
of $2,000 and an allowance for de-
pendent children.

Candidates ior the Fellowships
are nominated by professors. These
candidates are screened by panels
in 15 regions around the nation.
one-third of the candidates pass
through the screening and are in-
terviewed. From that group about
one-half receive Fellowships.

In the Midwest Conference, Care
leton had the most Wilson Fellow»

Goddard Delivers Senate Farewell;
Defends Position 0n ‘Status Quo'

By ALAN AXELROD

This year's Senate adjourned
for the last time Wednesday night
after listening to the swan song
of retiring SGA President Jerry
Goddard,

Goddard began by calling at-
tention to the record of SGA under
his leadership “Critics of student
government this year have shouted

from on high that this has been
a status qua government, and they
have been absolutely right. It has
been, and by design. At the first
Senate meeting in September I
made a statement to the student

tive Cabinet regarded its responsi-
bilities to the students and the

He then cited passages irom his
September speech in an attempt
to correlate his goals and achieve-
ments, "1 said in September that

Editorial
_.Goddard's Promises

‘ Wednesday night Jerry Goddard delivered the
traditional president’s farewell address to the Senate
Klee age 1) and his speech bears examination for it
roves r Goddard’s failure as an SGA president.

' Goddard pointed with pride to promises he made
In September. He promised maintenance of the status
quo, promised students would not “hear a lot of discus-
Ilon about what SGA is up to this time," promised no
search for “sweeping reforms,” and promised “rela—
tlvo calm" Goddard kept these promises,

' Goddard maintained the status quo. However, the
Item: quo, in his own words, lacked “dynamism” and
I "willingness to move ahead with more liberal pro-
grams. . .” Goddard complained bitterly in his speech
that in» the days of Dr. Bowen the campus made tre-
mendous progress “toward the ideal of a truly liberal
arts college" and that that “aspect of Grinnell College
. . . has been at least forgotten, if not lost entirely."

The reason progress has stopped is people like
Goddard who lack the ability and resolve to regain
lthis lost “dynamism" and ”willingness to move ahead
with more liberal programs. . .” The reason progress
has stopped is SGA presidents like Goddard who are
proud of maintaining the status quo but who at the
same time attack it. Goddard’s speech is filled with ref-
erence: to what is wrong with the status quo.

Goddard promised that there would not he a “lot
of discussion about what SGA is up to this time.” God-
dard did not seek discussion or, for that matter, partici-
pation. As all the SGA candidates this spring said,
Goddard’s administration lacked widespread student
“involvement.”

Along the same line of limited discussion. Goddard
accused the 5&1! of inaccurate reporting. We make mis-
takes in reporting, and most of them deal with SGA.
The reason for this has been the gross unwillingness of
Goddard to cooperate with the 58:13. Had the 58:3 been
sharply critical of Goddard, his stubborn refusal to help
us would have been understandable. What is so remark-
able is that his unwillingness to help seemed to lack
motive,

Another Goddard promise was not to “lead cru-
lades for sweeping reforms.” And he didn’t, His speech
called for reform of what he tagged the “if-you-don’t-
like-it-get-out attitude” of administration towards stu~
dents.

No leadership to back this much needed reform
was provided by Goddard. He was too busy maintaining

the status quo.

Goddard was proud of the “relative calm” that
existed this yeari We feel the "calm” could more accu-
rately be called boredom.

Goddard said that the college “has fallen prey to
all the conservative forces that plague an institution
without purpose” Goddard himself was one of those
“conservative forces” He sought to conserve or main-
taina system whose lack of progress he lashed out
against Wednesday night. We are not going to label
Goddard a failure. He did it for us.

Here's More Dirt — CDN Rigged

The administration is still mude
tiling over the North campus prob-
lem.

The students are still mobilizing
for rules changes.

But the high point of Grlnliell’s
much-discussed degeneration oc-
curred last week-end—one of the
computer dates was rigged.

Case in point: the test scores of
one of Grinnell’s happier institu-
tional couples correlated quite
well. The iowa city computer,
however, did not deem them to
be destined for one another!
which would not be a particularly
unusual instance. When they
matched computer cards the test
score correlation evaporated and
two worthy members or Honor G
implied to the male half of the
couple that the test scores
“might” have experienced a bit
oi an accident on their way to
lowa City.

From this perspective, the
screaming and trauma which took
place in the post oiirce as students
discovered the identity of their
dates Saturday morning projected
an unnerving image of the higher
powers ois‘ganizing the program-
ming for the computer, chuckling

However the 5&3 is not a pub
llcation of the muckraking variety
(letters . to - the - editor notwith-
standing) and does not postulate a
policy of antiathleticism (the ad
itor plays lM basketball and the
associated editor plays pingrpong).
Thcreiore, ln all respect tor, and
iairness to, Honor G, it must be
said that the monumental manner
in which most of the computer
dates bombed out or lucked out
could not have been rigged.

Perhaps the most surprising and
one or the more successiul coup-
les was Jun Streitt, lreshman
cheerleader, and Henry Wilhelm,
elderly (22) photographer, Said
Henry Saturday afternoon with
typical computer date rueiulness,
“I've already decided that I'd
marry her it she wants to.“ in
comparison to the "Good God,
I’m too young to die" expletives.
it was one of the calmer view-
points expressed.

The over-all atmosphere was
rather a harking back to sixth
grade behavior and psychology—
“Heck. I don‘t want to dance with
HER”—0r in some cases on a
more elevated junior high level—
“I wonder it he’s thinking the
same thing about me? I think I'm
going to be sick.”

Quite a iew junior, senior wom-
en - freshmen men combinations
occurred. This is not to imply that
there is anything unfortunate or
unusual in such age differentia-
tion, but only to note that several
interesting manifestations ensued

 

from such situationsinamely at
the Rex. where the boys had to
quit their senior, ID-possessing

The exhibition badminton game
at the half-time of the Monmouth
game between Cindy Root and
Coach Kowert could be considered
as symbolic of the computer date
night—depending on one's view-
point, either it was a draw or
they smeared each other.

North Campus Heads Favor Rule
Enforcement and B & G Reform

As in every campaign, the basic
Issues oi' those running tor the
presidencies oi the men’s halls
were the candidates’ characters
and capabilities. The principal
platiorm or those elected consist-
ed of more hall unity, their policy
of rule enforcement in the area of
illegal visitations, and reforming
BKzG.

The presidents at South Younker,
Cowles, Langan, and East Norris
represent in their platforms the
need for improvement in hall co-
hesion which was stressed by all.
Roger May of South Younker em-
phasized the need for the house
council to combat the hall’s apa-
thy by personally seeing that
there he more participation in
house meetings by the upperclass-
men and by seeking residents’ 0-
pinions on vital issues. The major
portion or this program, said May,
would be making tactions or the
hall work together as a unit in
hall projects.

Cowles has a similar problem
According to Rick Sprott of “too
many individuals living in singles
and not knowing' each other." He
desires it better freshman orienta-
tion program within the hall to in-
spire unity among the freshmen.
Social iunctions for which the en-
tire hall works as a unit Sprott

‘lees as another vital 'way, in
which hall cohesion may be in-
rpired. ,

According to Bob Swortwood oi
Langan, the halls must be im-
proved by means of closer relations
with the dean. The dean should be
shown that Langan students are

 

acting more maturely in respect-
ing others' rights, and that the
large ireshman class within the
hall is having a lot to do with the
change in the halls image.

In East Norris, the chief issues,
according to president-elect lay
WilliamsY “are how to improve

Most of East Norris was very con-

Open Dorm Policy

illegal opens is a touchy issue
in every hall. Most hall presidents
have decided to abide by the non<
controversial stand at not looking
inr violations of the visitation
rule. instead they say that as
long as one individual does not
interfere with another hall resi-
dent's rights, and as long as his
girl and be are not careless or
ﬂagrant in their violation or the
rule, nothing will be done. Some,
including Ray Hom of Rawson,
wish to make residents more care-
iul it they propose to violate the
law in order to prevent the hall
from acquiring an adverse reputa-
tion. Hom hopes to keep the ad
ministration out or the hall by
making hall officials more may

New AWS Board Stresses Individualism. Privacy
As Planning Stage for Next Year Gets Started

The newly elected AWS board
members have already met once
and are working in the planning
stages for next year. Some areas
that will probably be looked into
are changes in the selection and
pricing at the bookstore. an exten-
sion of the car rule, possible re-
ﬁnement of the late minutes and
locking procedure. and a key sys—
tem for South Campus. '

The ten new board members
were interviewed individually by
the 5&3 and were asked such
questions as: how do you view
the balance in a hall between pri-
vacy and participation: how much
of a role does each individual hall
play in relation to the rest of the
campus; in what areas would you
personally like to work as a mem-
ber of the AWS hoard?

Susan Sal-outs! ~ Main

"The balance between privacy
and participation depends on the
girls in the hall. I would publi-
cize everything at interest on cam-
pus and leave it at that.” Miss
Barquist thinks there are some
things, however, that cannot be
done without a minimum number
of participants, such as coffee
hours with iaculty members, and
taking trips.

Miss Barquist's main preoccupa-
tion as a board member would be
an examination and clarification
of the philosophy of the rules. She
feels that the board must know
where it is going, that it must de«
Clde whether it believes in the
rules or not. how they are going

 

Antioch to Give Contraceptives;
'Open Dorms' Subject of Survey

A policy allowing iernalc stu-
dents over 21 years of age to re-
ceive contraceptive medication or
devices without parental consent
has been adopted by Antioch Col-
lege.

The c h a n g e represents the
"maximum liberalization" which
the college health service could
undertake because of Ohio’s con-
servative state law. Students un-
der 21 must Still have parents' per-
mission to receive the medication.

The contraceptives will be pro
vided by the Antioch health ser-
vice wilh communication between
the student-patient and physician
being private and coniidei-itial, as
would be the case with any other
physician in private practice.

In the number of open dorms

school, has 52 hours a week; An-
tioch, 54 a week; and Rochester,
20 hours a week. Most colleges
agree that there are reiorms need-
ed, but as the editor at the swarm-
more student paper wrote, “It is
very difficult—reform will proceed
as quickly as our president pleas-
es. The deans listen politely and
explain, but most of their state-

Debbie Downs-Pine Tree

“There are certain things in a
hall that are communal and de-
mand cooperation, such as quiet
hours; but social life in the dorm
should be on a purely voluntary
basis,” Miss Downs feels that
while there should be no iorced
participation there should always
be activities in which to partici-
pate.

She thinks certain things have to
he hail-oriented ~ for example,
house parties and intramural
sports~but that campus questions
should not be imposed on the in-
dividual halls other than ior gen-
eral discussion. Miss Downs con-
siders Ihe role of the senators
very important in conveying infor-
mation and bringing the consen-
sus oi the hall back to the Senate.

Cldney Dunning~Mears

Miss Dunning will first evaluate
the type or students in her hall
and provide maximum opportunity
for them to mix with each other
and participate in such things as
IM's and house parties. “It would
certainly not be a forced afiair. I
would wait and see how well the
girls responded to such uppnrtun<
ities and gradually otter more and
more. I would not invade anyone's
privacy,” said Miss Dunning. She
would like her hall to be enthusi-
astic and hopes that the girls
would be happy to ‘ re up“ for
certain activities. Miss Dunning
feels that a hall should function
in its own unity. Individual halls
cannot aitect the entire campus,
because rule changes are not in-
itiated in a hall. She feels that
the hall should primarily be in-
volved in keeping its girls togeth-
er.

of the hall, be aware of interest
and cultivate it."

Miss Edelen believes that there
must never be pressure toward par-
ticipation, but channels of coma
munication should be set up
through the House Councrl and
aaiileooards with regard to such
activities as IM'S and student:
faculty get-togethers. She thinks
that each hall has its own im-
portance because it is the home
base for a certain number at
girls. She would strive to draw
out all types of interests within
the hall.

She also said that she would like
to see the AWS board meet once
a week throughout the year with
the Dean of Women to work to-
ward a more realistic set oi rules.

Susan Monte-Conference House

Miss Monto believes that both
privacy and participation have
their place. “My primary interesl
would be privacy, but at the same
time, each girl owes certain con-
siderations to the other members
of her hall." She would work
{rpm the inside out and hope that
the compatibility ot the girls
would stir up interest. Miss Morita
believes that interest cannot be
externally imposed, and that sim-
ply being told to "fire up" will .
have no eiiect on participation in
the hall.

of people satisfactorily. its mem»
bers must be able to feel a part
of the hall and be themselves; but
tit the same time, the hall must
meet certain requirements for pri-
vacy and isolation. She believes
that group activities should not be
stifled because of interest in
maintaining a chance for privacy,
and that this would be the job
of the house council Ultimately,
there should be an equal balance
between privacy and participation.

Paula Stephan-Loose

“It is the house president’s re-
sponsibiiity to ascertain people‘s
interests and encourage or re-
spect them. it is important to ap-
peal to those who want to particia
pate, While respecting the privacy
of others." Miss Stephan sees no
conflict of interest here, and that
with a good house Council there
will be no real problem.

She would encourage improved
communication with the Senate,
and more student-faculty inter-
changes within the hall.

Miss Stephan views the board
as serving in a creative capacity,
not just as an executive body. She
favors increased communication
with and respect for the Dean of
Women and the rest oi the admin-
istration in working out problems
such as graduated hours and the
lack of privacy on campus.

Cris Swanson-Homes

“Each person is an individual,
but given this system or dormi-
tory liie, every girl has an obli-
gation to recognize the rights of
the people with whom she is liv-
ing.” Miss Swanson believes that
everyone has the right to he
“fired up” over activities, but she
would not force anyone to do so.

She would like to see a reor-
ganization oi the house council to
make ottices such as music chair-
man and social chairman more
useiuL On the campus level, she
would like the rule system to be
brought into greater Contact with
reality.

Jenn TePuanrnes

Miss TePaske believes that 11%
pie should be tolerant of and in-
terested in each other. "Enthusi-
asm should be generated so some
can participate, but each girl
should be able to do more or

She thinks that there has been a

such as lM sports and house par-
ties. come out oi the hall. She
feel that it is of primary import-
ance to make information about
campus activities available either
informally or through the presi-
dent or the house council.

Miss Ward believes that the em-
phasis oi the hall should be on
the individual floors. “It is impos-
sible to get a large group together
to get things going, so such ar-
rangements should be made
through the Baiiieboard. The Bat-
ileboard can most easily get to

.know the people in the hall, es-

pecially freshmen.

She thinks that respect toward
every individual comes from the
attitude of the president and the
Baiileboard. “A hall guides itself
through the way people make

out all firsttlme violations of this
rule without lining the individual
involved. But Bob Geller of North
Younker gave the prevailing atti-
tudé of most presidents when he
said that the first violation would
be punished with a tine, the sec
and with action in primary court.
All presidents said that the Cof-
HP would definitely take some
step in liberalization of hall hours.

BM} Problem

B&G's excessive tines was ans
other area in which the hall pres-
idents hoped the CotHP would
take some positive action. All said
that the three-member committee
to which appeals are made by stu-
dents should be abolished since it
is controlled by those who ﬁrst
fix the amount of tine. Many
would like to see in its place the

visors take over responsibility ol

about 3&6 policies were the 'min-
imum labor charge ct two dollars

and the liguring oi depreciation in

 

the lines which B&G will give to
students.

Car Rule

All presidents agreed that the car
rule should be given to juniors, but
Dick Faxon of Dibble thinks that
a junior car rule is not as neces»
sary as a college provision tor
more cars to be available to stun
dents {or use in trips to special
events and oil campus house par- :
ties ,

Since the number of seniors
owning cars is small in compari-
son to the size of the class, and
since there probably will not be
many more juniors with cars, he
thinks that more college cars is
the only answer it student trans—
portation is to he adequate.

changes and the pace of progress
that are possible. In closing. i
asked the Senate to realize that
some matters are too small to be
concerned with, and some are too
large to be changed"

in clarifying the role he has
played as student government
leader, Goddard said that the
principles he has tried to main-
tain were born of “three years of
watching my predecessors try to
eiiect change by stirring the stu-
dents to an irrational frenzy or by
playing political footsy with the col-
lege administration." He ex-
plained that these methods bring
nothing but distrust toward stu»
dent government, and referred to
his term of office as “a year of
relative calm in student—adminis-
tration relations."

Points to Problems

Reviewing the past year, he
said, “I think dorm life has been
quite satisfactory this year.” ad-
ding that he no longer believes
there is a ”North Campus Prob-
lem" as such. He did, however.
point out certain problems on
North Campus "South pit, Langan
basement, and Cowles zoo, forming
Grinnell’s own iron triangle, are
areas for concern but certainly not
reformist panic."

Goddard mentioned that he
thinks the students have shown a
“substantial improvement” over
last year in regard to incidents
of malicious damage to college and
personal property, and “disorder-

1y conduct resulting itom intoxi-
cation." Goddard suggested. “It
might be well for those who are
recommending the solutions to all
our problems and who seem to
hear only oi the sordid incidents,
to move into some of the vacant
rooms they have created and ex«
perience North Campus life on a
day-to-day basis.”

Slams 5&3

Turning to student aciiVlties,
Goddard said, “The campus is do-
ing pretty well. With the possible
exception of the basketball team
and the 5&3, students seem to be
taking up their spare time with
fairly worthwhile and Successful
endeavors.” Excepting John Wolf,
he said, “The staff at our campus
newspaper has shown an incred-
ible lack of imagination and re»
porting accuracy, 1 would suggest
that perhaps they should spend
less time gazing at comets and
picket lines and more time consid<
ering their responsibilities to their
readers."

Shifts Ground

Goddard decided at this point,
“to shift the ground of this speech
away from some of our rather
narrow student government con-
cerns and discuss what I think is
a broader and more important
problem of the entire college com
munity. In so doing, I am going
to briefly sketch some history of
the college in the past decade be-
cause it is helpful to an under-
standing oi our most serious short-
coming.”

 

He then proceeded to paint a
picture of Grinneii in its heyday
under President Bowen. He Called
attention to Grinnell’s financial
difficulties in the early ‘505 and
enumerated the successful finan-
cial efforts undertaken by the col-
lege under Bowen. Goddard also
lauded the curriculum changes of
this period reierring speciﬁcally
to the freshman distinction pro
gram, the American Studies ma-
jol', the Argonne semester, and the
construction of the present lan-
guage laboratory.

Praises Bowen Period

His next topic was the social
liie during the Bowen period, and
he said that during this period
the college’s attitude was that
there was real value in having the
students meet and solve their own
problems. Regarding his sketch or
the Bowen years, he said, “The
reason I am recalling all this to
your attention is because I think
it illustrates an aspect oi Grinnell
College that has been at least Iorv
gotten, it not lost entirely.

“in the late ’505 and early ’505
this college had a sense of dir-
rection, a commitment of what it
was, where it was going, and how
it was going to get there. There
was a sense of social and intel-
lectual excitement, as climate of
optimism on the campus."

Laments Loss
He continued, “But in the last
tow years this spirit, this dyna-
mism, and this willingness to
move ahead with more liberal

 

programs has been lost. Grinneii
College is no longer at the fore-
front of education and community
organization. Beyond evidence or
any planning, Grinnell seems to
have lost sight of the liberal ideal.
it has lost its committment to pro-
gl‘essivism, no matter what the
cost. And it has lost the sense of
excitement that once prospered on
this campus

“In this condition or drift the

er than telling its donors to spend
their money elsewhere if they
don’t agree with progressive cam-
pus policies, the college is now
advising students who desire a
more liberal living situation to
transfer to another institution
This if»you»don’t~iike»it7get-out at-
titude can only atrophy commu—
nity imagination."
Places Responsibility

According to Goddard, the re
sponsibility ior eradicating this
attitude “rests With the students
who have abdicated their respon~
sibility to the community, the fac-
ulty who have not supported the
administration against outside
pressure, and the parents and
alumni who believe only what they
read about Grinnell in the Des
Moines Register."

In closing, Goddard said, “I
would like to express my special
thanks to some of the people I’ve
been proud to work with this
year.” He cited Dean Thompson
ioi~ bringing “a much - needed
pragmatism to the conduct of stu-
dent affairs over the past two
years," and he praised Dean win-
ters as “probably the most out-
standing administrator to come to
Grinnell in recent years."

Thanks Associates

He thanked Ellen Detering, sec-
relary oi the Senate, and Cherie
Joiner, secretary of the executive
cabinet. “And finally I want to
express my gratitude to Chris (Pe-
terson) whose confidence and sup-
port have been a continuing source
at happiness for me. at all 1 have
gained irom my work in student
government this year, her friend-
ship ranks highest.”

‘ Pioneers Held Under In Swim Season;
Finish Seventh At Conference Meet

The Pioneer swimming team
finished a lean season last week-
end, when they took seventh place
in the conference meet at Law-
rence, scoring lo points. Cornell
won the meet easily with 66v,
points.

5' The only bright spot in an other-
wise lackluster performance was
the setting of a conference record
by Ken Adelman in the ZOO-yard
butterﬂy. Previous record was
2:155, which Adelman broke in
the preliminaries with a time of

, 2311.9. The Pioneers altogether
picked up one second, one fourth.
and one sixth to score their ten
points.

Adelman was the tap Pioneer
finisher with a second place time
of 2: 13.2 in the ZOO—yard butterfly
in the finals. Steve Holtze picked
tip the Pioneer fourth in the Zoo

yard individual medley. Hollze and
Adelman then joined Bob Wells
and Bill Lantl an the sixth place
too-yard relay team.

The team has been hindered all
season by its lack of size and
strength and consequent spotty
weaknesses. The team has done a
creditable job of overcoming this
problem all season. but it proved
a crippling handicap at the confer-
ence meet.

Unfortunately, Coach Irv Si-
mone has to how out at a time
when the swimming fortunes are
at a low and when the chances for
improvement are not too encour-
aging. Perhaps the lack of facili—
ties for the swimmers is failing to
attract potential Pioneer swim-
mers, and will contine to hinder
the development of a solid swim-
ming team.

Basketball Season Ends Dismal/y

As Frantz Rewrite: Record Books

The Pioneer basketball team
finished a dismal season last
weekend with a pair of losses to
Knox and Monmouth. Also dismal
is the departure of Jeri Frantz
after this season with its Grinnell
all - time scoring record of 1312
points, more than two hundred ov-
er his nearest competitor. Already
in seventh place on the list after
only his first two years of play-
ing. Jeff easily overlook the first
six with his 412 points this year.
The point-count of this year was a
drop from his record year of 1964-
65 when he poured through 512
points. This can prohahly be ex-
plained by the fact that he Went
out for football this year so that he
had a more ditiicult time getting
in shape for basketball and also
had to spend a great portion of his
time battling lor rebounds which
left less time for scoring. This
way, though, he became the top
rebounder for the Pioneers

Jeff's scon‘ng average over the
three years was 19.33, just a
shade llnder the all-time best Pio
