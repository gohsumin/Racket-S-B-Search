Inaugural Events Will Honor President

teggett Address Will Concern Role
Of Individuals in College Community

Weekend Feature:
A Milli Original

By JUDY SCOTT

BBtG has had to stretch its in-
genuity for the Inaugural Week-
end. At first it seemed a small
request: find a 400 foot canopy,
needed to run [mm the science
building to Darby tor Sunday‘s
procession as protection against
possible rain.

According to Physical Plant Di-
rector Evan Walden, there was no
canopy to be found ill Waterloo,
Des Moines, or anywhere else in
Iowa or its neighboring slates.
After the fruitless search, B&G
constructed one using wood sup-
ports and a polyethylene covering

Despite Walden's iii-st illtent to
get a “candy - striped, or some
such iancy one,” B&G's own cre-
ation ivas originally designated to
be painted black. Then black was
rejected as too ”iunei'alish”;
white was the next possibility but
was also thrown out as being too
blar' g The ﬁnal decision was a
luscious, light olive green which
should blend in nicely with the
general complexion color of the
inaugural participants it the wea-
ther does turri toui. Then again,
since the canopy is one of the
biggest expenses tor the weekend
it would almost be a shame if
it did not, at least, lightly sprinkle.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

DR. GLENN LEGGETT. who

is to be inaugurated as the

eighth president or Grinnell College at 2:30 on Sunday in
Derby Gymnasium renewing a weekend of events honoring
him. seen in his eiiiciel portrait.

After leading Grinnell tor seven-
andra-hali months, Dr. Glenn Leg-
gett will officially become the col<
lege’s eighth president Sunday.

The ceremony, scheduled for2130
pm. in Darby Gym, is expected
to draw more than 2,000 persons,
including all but one of the presi-
dents ill the Mitlwest Conference
and representatives lrom 150 other
colleges and universities.

in his inaugural address, “The
importance ol Being Earnest,"
Leggett will explore the meaning
or the term community as it ap-
plies to the residential college. He
will put emphasis on the preser-
vation of individual identity while
increasing and improving methods
of communication between educa-
tors and students.

This communication will entail
the continuing involvement or the
iaculty in the total community
Leggett observes that the students
have become separated irom the
community, and that while this
has served its own purpose, it is
now time for a new understand-
ing hetweeli the students and edu-
caters.

ln Leggelt’s view, Grinnell is “a
college that takes the risk or do-
ing only one thing and doing it
well.” This thing is an under-
graduate, liberal arts education
He has set himseli the task this
year oi understanding the Hunt

 

queness of the college" and leam<
ing “the right questions to aslc"

The inaugural ceremony will be
preceded by an academic proces-
sion of 375 persons ranging from
members oi the Grinnell Board of
Trustees to representatives ol the
student body. The inauguration will
be conducted by Edwin S. Hewitt,
chairman ol the Board of Trus-
tees. Tile new president Will then

hell; and Arland F. ChristrJaner,
president or Cornell College and
chairman of the Associated Col<
leges ot the Midwest

son E. Fei get of Des Monies. The

sic under the direction of Denis

Alarm About Faculty Departures

oii campus lately there have
been growing concerns about the

problem in high faculty mmover
is not a problem at all. One pro-
iessor said that perhaps the issue
is not that too many prolessors
are leaving, but that too few
are leaving. The reasoning behind
this is that a moderate turnover
or faculty members indicates the
willingness of the college to seek
new ideas. One professor went on
to say that this does not necessarily
mean that there is dissatisfaction
with the existing staff, as can be
seen by the consistently high qualr
ity of the faculty

Another observation made was
that there was not a problem oi

admitted that a person would not

Katz to Teach at U. oi Mass,-
Saw Little Sell-Motivation Here

Seymour Katz (English) leaves
Grinnell at the end of May to
teach at the University or Massa-
chusetts’ new Boston campusi

As a member oi the college’s
division of humanities, Katz will
teach three courses in humanities.
He also hopes to teach American
Literature when such courses are
termed.

“I have two reasons for leav-
ing,” Katz said. “I want to try
a dllfercnt kind of institution and
gain a diiiereut sort or experience
in my career. Grinnell, alter all,
has been my only teaching exper-
icnce thus far.”

Katz’s second reason tor leaving
Grinnell is his desire to be closer
t0 the Eastern research libraries.
He plans to continue work on Save
eral l-iawthoi-ne papers which
will eventually toim part ot
a book. He has been doing research
on Hawthorne tor the past tour
years.

“I think the students are very
agreeable, capable. and interested,

 

and they pertorm well — when
you ask them. But," said Katz,

Student Ideas

Sunday afternoon we will inaugurate a new leader
for Grinnell. In his inaugural address President Glenn

Leggett will tell the college that it is time for a ”reaf»
firmation" of the sense of community and that any
break-down in communications that may have typified
Grinnell and other campuses in past years should now
come to an end. Leggett will say it is time for the stu—
dents, faculty, and administration to get together and
solve these problems.

In recent weeks we’ve had several occasions to talk
with President Leggett about the college community.
Most recently it has been with regard to our editorial
policy. Leggett seeks a more constructive policy from
the 58:3; he wants to see us making policy suggestions
for the college.

We’ve been reluctant to do this. We‘ve been more
willing to limit ourselves to a critical posture, offering
our opinions as particular cases arise. The reason we
have chosen this stand is that it has seemed to be more
effective for past editors. The record of willingness on
the part of the administration to react to student crit»
icism has been far better than their willingness to re—
act to new plan It is easier to dismiss as “impractical
at this time" a constructive proposal than it is to an-
swer a criticism of an existing but poorly working
policy,

It is our opinion that in recent years at Grinnell
the effect of any student-promoted proposal has been
little. The conflict that Leggett will speak of Sunday
has driven a wedge between students and administra-
tion that created on the part of the students a suspi~
Cious, hyper-critical attitude toward the administration.
We hope that when Leggett speaks of more and closer
work with students he means that the students’ opin—
ions will not only be sought more but considered more
than they have in the past.

If this proves to be the case, if President Leggett
can bring about a better working relationship with
the students then he will have accomplished a great
deal. But even with better working relations. the pri-
mary responsibility for creative leadership rests with
him. And while it is good to know that any constructive
and thoughtful proposals that students may present
are going to get fair attention, we think that it is likely
that students will continue to look toward the presi~
dent’s office for the new ideas that Grinnell needs.

And Student Praise

It’s not often that we take this space to applaud
an act by the administration. But this week I think
we’ve witnessed an unparalleled act of broad-mindness
on their part.

Thursday morning an art exhibit was hung in the
Forum. The exhibit was created by photographer Hen-
ry Wilhelm, co—editor of the Cyclone. A few of the pho-
tographs aroused a question of propriety in some cir-
cles. Some went so far as to have portions of the exhibit
removed. When confronted with this conflict, however,
the administration took a bold, strong, liberal, and high
ly enlightened position. They had the removed photo—
graphs replaced. It is a promising sign to see this alti~
tude on the part of the administration.

The Grudge Pot

i was quite enjoying my dinner last Friday,
having saved the plumpest Shrimp fur lasl.
when as I eased my lurk into the lender mor-
sel a muted scream violated the conviviality
of the, Quad. Piteous of some, as-yet-anohy‘
mous girl being frightened from he: meal, and
angered by the Wretch who would have dared
to do such a deed, I looked anxiously, bul with
sympathy ready in my deepvblue eyes. about
the table for that pale, tearrstn'cken, nauseous
grotesquely that — only seconds before — had
been the lace or a pure and Charming miss,

Much to my dismay, alas, I perceived only
empty chairs and slaie smoke arising lrom
cigarette butts, for my sometime, meal-time
companions had not shared my sensitivity to
the delicacy and complexity or victuals, nor
ever had known the necessity of slow gunman-
dizing.

Horrors! Behold - it must have been the
shrimp who had called out. Guiltily, secreA
lively cramming that daleclable little dainty
into my shirt pocket —- grease stains spreading
like ominous blots of sin — I hastened to the
privacy of my apartment, pulled the curtains,
and laid the battered crustacean upon my
desk. What perverse, primal manifestation
was this?

"Let it be known in lhe world," I heard the
shrimp say, solemnly, puiulully, “that l was

filed in deep fat — mere Wesson Oil — as a
living Sacrifice lo artificiality and sham, The
greasy eruptions and violet pits that decorale
your youths’ faces are the hideous signs or
the degradation to lollow."

“What can i do?" i asked, falling, lying
prostrate, grovelling, flapping my limbs in lu-
lilc abandon over my carpet (which is of a
miller expensive sort that cannot stand ma
much of such wear). “ls this lhe end? A pmg»
ress to nonexistence, a twelve-line sonnet, a
race where the, horses gallop off into invisi-
bility, non-nuclear devastation and annihilation.
a meaningless hollow silent scream — is this
civilization?"

“Tell lhe world," said the shrimp.

“Tell them what? What?"

But my roommate, proud, haughty. dis-
dainlul and free, strode past the trembling
posture of my body and lilled that plump
shrimp in his lips and in two bites devoured
it.

I awaited the carbuncles and boils to seep
from his pores like dirt from the end of a
worm, but he only smiled and asked me why
1 was sleeping nu me hard llovr. 0h, bitter dis-
illusionment! False tale! What a promiscuous
whore you are. Before the mirror, I saw the
small red head at a pimple assert itseli upon
the whileness or my face,

Cyclone '66

By JOHN WOLF

Last year’s Cyclone editor said.
"it you’re really going to do the
yearbook the way you plan to, you
won't, have time for anything
sister"

She was right about the “any«
thing else," but this year’s editors
ARE doing the Cyclone the way
they planned to,

John Phillips, co-editor of the ’66

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

PHILLIPS

Cyclone, leels that “it is our over-
all purpose to give the concept oi
'yearbook’ a new vitality and re-
vive it as a meaningful institution,
It has so much potential; t's time
to take advantage at it.”

Among the major additions to
this year's book are senior por»
traits taken in real-life situations.

Managing editor Susan Barquist,
who has been organizing the tak-
ing of senior portraits, says, "Sen-
iors have been photographed in an
Economics seminar, in the new
greenhouse, at the skating rink, as
well as playing in a Wednesday
,‘night jam session, partaking at
the Rex. watching a basketball
game. working in the library and
in the art department, dissecting
rats in lab, staring on into space
in their looms—8nd this is only
Ihe beginning."

"Faculty pictures are being tak-
en in more or less the same man-
ner as senior pictures, very often
in classroom situatlons." notes coa
editor Henry Wilhelm. “We want to
portray iaculty members in the
way that students are likely to
remember them. We photographed

ture than the usual stilted studio
type portrait. The studenttaeulty
portraits will, by the way of their
varied situations, also show a
great deal of the ‘Grinneli expeb
lence.' ”

 

 

 

 

 

 

WILHELM

In commenting on sales, busi»
ness manager Tim Ablett notes:
“Things are going pretty well;
however we are trying to sell more
books this year than were sold in
past years There are still many
taculty members and seniors who
haven’t ordered a book. We think
that most seniors will want a hook,
especially because ot the g reat
space that will be devoted to senior
portraits, Therefore, we are ex
tending sales another week until
April 25.

“When the 1965 Cyclone came
out there were a surprising num-
her of people who, wanted to buy
a book but who hadn’t ordered
one the year hetore. Next October
we won't have any extra ‘66
Cyclones, and I would hate to see
anyone disappointed. Practically
everyone in Grinneli Will be pic—
tured in one activity or another,
but many people won't realize this
until the book is already out . s .
and by then it will be too late
to do anything about it.”

Phillips and Wilhelm explain:
"An example of how we will cover
an event is the story of SGA—
the convention and the election.
We have been taking pictures at

 

SGA activities for some time—to

the consternation of some of the ,

ofﬁcers~snd these Will be the
background of the story of the
election. What SGA was and was
not doing were important issues
with the various candidates, so all
these things will tie in, We fol-
lowed the candidates during their
c a m p a i g n s and [allowed their
forces during the convention and
then photographed Steve Kent as
he was told that he had Want To
this we added some of the things
that the Kent administration has
been involved in during the rest
ot the year. With appropriate copy,
this method or doing a story
should give some or the feeling of
what is to be “involved" in SGA.

“This is What. we’re trying to do

with this hook-that is, trying to

view student life as a related
whole. Most students don't lead a
compartmentalized life; people are
always doing things and relating
to other people, We’re trying to
go ln depth and get at the es-
sence at Grinnell.

“This will be a book about real
people, not just faces and events."

Off-Campus Woman Exits Illegally;
‘ Punishment To Be Conduct Probation

Last week the Women’s Primary
Court sentenced a woman to twen~
ty nights of hall continement with
ten nights suspended, and recom-
mended revocation oi ntfrcampus
housing privileges and transler to

r the Quadrangle as soon as possible.

G

In addition, the Court's recom-
mendation of conduct probation
until the end of the current semes-
ter has been accepted by the
Dean’s Committee

The woman involved was
charged with illegal exit and later
ness in excess at one-and-a-halt
hours. The woman pleaded guilty
to the illegal exit but pleaded in-
nocent to the charge of lateness in
excess of oiie-altd-a-half hours. She
was found guilty of both charges.

The Woman left her residence at
about 1:15 a.m. and returned at
2:30 a.m. The Court said that the
term lateness “is something or a

\misnomer in this case," but went

on to say that “there is no other
charge presently in the hand hook
which Covers the violation.” Late-
ness is counted from hours, in this
instance, 12:30 am.

The Court stated that. at the time
of the case there was not a “truly
appropriate charge“ but that now
that the administration has ap-
proved a charge of "unauthnrized
absence from the Quadrangle" this
problem will not arise again.

The penalty tor an unauthorized
absence between final closing
hours and 6 am. will range

An additional change states that

The suggestion to move the wo-
man back to the Quadrangle sets
a precedent. The Court said this
was done in order to “stress the
need tor responsibility and matur-
ity wuhin oft-campus living quarr

“The delendaiit’s actions Consti-
lute an abuse of these (oil-
campus) privileges.”

Thus the seniors at the Univer-

a protest petition within their
class objecting to the placing of a
“seal of approval” on his ideas
conceniing academic freedom,

said that he would welcome a Viet
Cong victory in Viet Nam.

When Drew University did not
renew the contract at one of their
professors who participated in the
teach-in, because of “academic
reasons," Nixon stated that he ad-
mired the subtlety of the Drew
officials, thus giving support to the
idea of using academic pressure

"If I were governor I would not

Faniasiick Fairy Tale
Produced for Arena

Thursday night at a pm. the
musical The Fantasticks goes on
stage in arena theater. Directed
as an independent project by Deb-
orah Hui-listine, the show com-
bines free verse dialogue and
songs in an adaptation of the
French stoxy The Romantics

The Fantasllcks begins with a
fairy tale act in which boy (Mun
ray Nelson) meets girl (Stephanie
Lewis), and subsequently they fall
in love and marry. Their fathers
(Milt Tootle and Tom Pope) have
successfully rigged the romance,
including a feud to further the love
atlair. To bring about a reconcil-
iation between the “feuding” fa-
thers. a staged abduction is
planned. El Gallo, narrator ot the
musical (Ric MacDowell) is hired
to effect a phony rape.

At the beginning of the second
act the characters are restless and
quarrelsome. As El Gallo presents
the bill for the rape, the mas-
querade is exposed. the lovers
part and the fathers lapse into a
real lend, Significantly enough,
the wall is torn down before it
is erected again. Enter the hero,
as the boy retums from his world-
ly adventures to find the girl has
been deceived by El Gallo. Enter
the theme, as the boy and girl
fail in love again, this time know»
ing what it is to be hurt, and thus
lrncwing better what love means.

Meanwhile, back at the wall, the
fathers have found a common
bond in their mutual affection for
vegetables — because they’re so
predictable, so dependable, unlike
children. They suggest tear-
ing down the wall. but El Gallo
intervenes and insists lhat the wall
must stay and can never be torn
down.

Characters and others instru»
menial to the production include

 

Keith King, musical director;
Anne Hoganson and Janet Hamil-
ton, pianists; Max l-leligott, sec-
ond actor; Ruthie Sternberg,
who portrays various props. Must
cal numbers in the Show include
“Try to Remember." “Much
More,” and “Soon It‘s Gorilla
Rain,”

Previous workshops have been
financed by drama department
funds; however, Miss Burnstine
is breaking precedent by receiv-
ing financial support from SGA.
Miss Bunlstine also broke prece—
dent last year when her produc~
tion of The American Dream
went on the road and was the
first Grinnell play to do so in five
years. The American Dream helped
pave the way for the performance
of The Bourgeoisie at Cornell this
year.

According to Katz there have
been no abrupt changes in the

has taught here. He described the
students as proving “fairly homo-

Kafz loolrs forward to two spe-

diiieient type or student body,
since it is an urban community
and most students will be com-

College ‘Spiril' Would Shock J. 3.;
Evolves lo Unforeseen Extremes

By ANNE FARRER

There are several approaches
that may be taken when consid-
ering Grinnell. There is the per-
spective's “aren't’the squir-
rels neat, what do you do during
open dorms anyway?“ approach.
There's the hang a lantern in
Goodnow tower, the trustees are
coming approach. And there's the
historical approach, for whatever
Grinnell is, it is the oldest one
of it west of the Mississippi.

Although one now receives the
impression that Giinnell s p r a n 3
fully armed and con-ivfed from the
brow of I. B. Grinnell, it was by
process that Grinnell arrived at its
present state. An example and in-
tegral part oi this process is the
evolution of the present status of
liquor at Grinnell.

In the beginning I. B. Grinnell
created the college and liquor was
immediately placed at a disad-
vantage; lor the original plan
was as iollows: a board was chos~
all and it was provided that the
net proceeds from the lots in the
northwest quarter oi Section is be
given to Grinnell University, “with
the express provision that the lots
should revert to Mr. Grinnell ii
ardent spirits for a beverage
should ever be sold thereon with-
out his consent or that of his legal
representatives.”

Later this stipulation was elr
iecilvely removed by court action,

p Turnover

or the decisions made by depart—
ing faculty, though higherrsalaried
positions were usually accepted,

it was generally felt that at
Grinneli, tenure, a traditional prob.
blcrn in some colleges and uni-
versities, was not an issue at all.
Most proiessors produce enough
material at G inoell to gain na»
ticnal recognition and this was
cited as one of the big factors
in the drawing away of faculty
members; several department
heads said that the places where
the prolessors were going or had
gone should be used as an index
of the desirability of the faculty
and that the departure should not
be counted as a total loss iﬂl' the
college but as a gain in the pres-
tige oi the iaclllly.

The major lactor m llle depatv
z - oi any proiesscr. was clas-
5 ed as one of market. Most oi
the people interviewed empha-
sized tlie lacl that opportunities
in education were increasing at
such a rate that the availability
of a position, especially tor a pro-
lessor coming irom Grinnell, was
almost limitless. The mat et. in
other words, is a seller’s market.
James Kissane (English) noted
that the departments that were in
the best shape were the ones to
lose the best men. He cited Pro-
iessors Fox, Springer, Cole, and
Westiail in previous years. He
went on to say that not many
people leave without an offer.

Joseph Wall (history) said that
stair members usually leave be-
cause of oppoi-runiiies for special-
ization and more time for research
and publication, He said that this
was particularly true at the his-
tol'y department.

One of the largest reasons cited
ior the fact that more proiessors
did not leave was that the college

 

 

but the intent was carried on in
November. 1904, with the estab~
lishment of a local chapter of the
American Prohibition C ollegﬂ
League. In true Grinnell fashion,
the chapter was to attack the so-
cial menace or alcohol by “but.
lining courses of study on variouii
lines dealing with the liquoi
problem and to produce as a re-
sult of study theses and oralions
which shall help the cause of pro
hibition."

The machinery of Grinnell ran
smoothly, though with somewhat oi
a lack of lubrication, until Decem-
ber, 1931, when the council oi
house chairmen began an investi-
gation of the use of liquor on cam-
pus. This el ited a traditional
S lo 3 editorial:

The. scarlet and Black. des-
pite opposition, is today pub-
lishing a story on the liquor in<
vestigaiion now in progress here.
Thls is curried because the his
vesiigation ls news, and action
taken either by studem governing
organizations or by the admin-
lstrative committee is of vital

inlerest to the student body.

Whispered rumors Is to meet-
ings and summons may IS well
be made public it they are true.
Grinnell does not countenanco
drinking by students here, and
letting both the students and
public know that such is the
case can do no harm.

As a result of the investigation
eight Clark men were placed on
social probation, which in 1931
was no dating, day or night, until
the end of the year. Tome of
these Clark men were subject to
dismissal at the end of the year
(it they reacted in true, red»blooded
Grinnell spirit, they probably left
right then).

The Climax in Grinnell's his
cholic history came in 1964 when
at the instigation of SGA. liquor
was legalized on campus tor stu-
dents over 21.

At present, the college is strug-
gling with the rather nebuloul
“North Campus Problem" and in
regard to this, one can best ad-
monish: God grant me the serenity
lo accept the things l can’t change,
the courage to change the things
I can, and the wisdom to liniJW
the difference (the Alcholics Anon-
ymctls prayer).

tiles, in large measure, to meet
the competition in salary and pi)-
sitlon offered by other instliulious.
According to Kissane, the college,
in several Crucial instances, has
done a great deal to keep people
here."

As lat as the specific depart-
ments are concerned, all of llia
professors interviewed ielt that
their departments are stable; with
some expansion most of their aca-
demic stall problems would be
solved; and that they are com-
pletely satisfied with the rlcpui
mental policy and the caliber oi
the faculty and students.

Dean James Slauss issued a Writ-
ten statement to the ski! which
said that lurllover was at “the
normal level" from 1964-65 to 1955-
66. srnuss cited .. Tlpl'oved protes-
sional opportunity.” “desire to
teach ill a larger department in
to live iii an urban area," and
“more promising personal or pro-
iessional satisfactions our other
grounds” as three reasons why
facility leave Grinnell.
