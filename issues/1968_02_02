WHEN RUMORS RUN WILD ,

NEWS LEAK KILLS BOYCOTT

By NEIL FISCHER

(Editor‘s Note: In an at-
tempt to sift through the boy-
cott situation that muddled
itself together all this week.
the 5&3 Staff conducted over
sixty Interviews and spent
over fifty man-hours. Two
staffers — Joshua Sachs and
David Horwatt — deserve
credit tor a good part oi the
tollowing news analysis
which represents, the sol;
feels, an accurate account of
the events which rocked the
campus for the last few
days.)

By the time the Forum open-
ed a little after 2 pm. Sunday,
a very enticing rumor had
reached the 58:3 offices. TWO
or three ditlerent sources said
that Max Helfgott had gotten
very up-light some time over
the weekend at Toad Hall —
an oil»campus house at 1525
6th Ave. — during a discussion
of the Town vs. Negro Student
problem.

They added that Hellgott
was trying to organize a boy-
Cult of the hamlet of Grinnell
by the entire student body of
the College.

That was a rumor that de-
served some checking.

But more wasn’t any time to
do any checking.

On his way back to campus
Saturday, Helfgott — an oli-
campus senior —- showed D.
Mayer, owner of the East End
Grocery, a copy ot the plans
and asked him what he thought
0! the boycott idea.

LEFTOVER ON THE
MEAT COUNTER

The meat counter was a little
busy that day, and Moyer
said he didn’t have time to
look at the mimeographed
paper Heltgott gave him.

Hellgott went. off to class,

and Moyer left the document

out on the counter for all the.

town to read,

Prof. Alan Jones (History) —
also a member of the Grinnell
City Council — happened to see
it there above the raw ham-
burger.

The mimeographed sheet at
East End was, Helfgott said
later. “the only one then in ex-
istence — the only poster post-
ed.”

Some townspeople found out
about it and got very up—tight.
The CuiHP found out about. it
and discussed it, according to
President Ron Cogswell, for
about iive hours Sunday night;
they got very up—light. And, in
their turn, the Negro contingent
on campus found out Heligott
was serious about the boycottt,
and they got very, very up-
tight.

But by then the snowball of
rumor was going all down hill,
and everybody seemed unwill-
ing to Stop it.

LARGE GROUPS
DISCUSSING

Monday large discussion
groups Could be found scatter-
ed all around campus * in
Main lounge, in the Forum
grill, in off-campus apart-
ments, in North Younker
rooms.

Some groups were continuing
plans tor a weeklong, ”token
boycott" of the town.

Some were discussing the
necessity for and practicability
of boycotts in general. Some
were making up new, wild ru-
mars.

Others — notably groups of
Negro students »— were won-
dering if boycotts might not be
the wrong answer after all.

Meanwhile Helfgott and his
group were trying to get in-
iorrnntion to the student body

around here," he told the Si‘rB

of half a dozen instances of ag<
gression against Negro
dents by townies, made a sten-
cil, and took it over to the Col-
lege Service Bureau to have
1,200 copies run oii,

Father John Hedger and
Reverend Newell Davis, both

ministers in town, offered to'

“get the money somehow" to
ilnance the mimeographing,
according to l-lelfgott.

FOR THEM

The ladies at the Service
Bureau, however, took one
look at what was Written on
Helfgott’s Stencil, decided it
was [on controversial tor them,
and told the boycott group they
couldn’t run or: copies oi
“that" without College approv-
Bl.

They sent Hellgott to Mary
G. Jones, Alumni Secretary
and head of the Service Bu-
reau operation.

She told the group the same
thing and sent them to Dean
Richard Winters. So Heltgott
and group puiied and panted
over to Burling basement only
to hear {mm the dean that the
stencil would have to have a
faculty sponsor.

The forthcoming campus ra-
dio station — represented by
oil-campus senior Eabak Ar-
majani, one of the early plan<
ners oi the boycott H oifered
to sponsor the mimeographing.

Winters said that Wasn't
any good, either.

Heligott asked Chairman of
the Faculty Joseph Wall to
sponsor it, but before Wall
could answer, Prof. Robert. Ca-
nary (English) agreed to put
his name on the Stencil as
sponsor,

A small return on the campus
recruitment poll run in last
week’s issue of the 5&3 showed
strong approval (59 yes; 1 no)
of President beggett’s decision
to postpone the Marine recrulb
ers until the recruitment obliga<
tions oi the college had been
iurther discussed. The reason
scents obvious as only four of
the sixty people who answered
the Dow questionnaire ex-
pressed doubt that Grinnell stu-
dents would demonstrate ii Dow
rent a job recruiter to campus.

There was. however, a varie-
ty of speculations concerning
the nature of the demonstration.
Forty»three said they thought
that such demonstrations would
be peaceful while twelve said it
would be violent. A majority
thought it would be small rath-
er than large. A majority also
said that they thought the dem-
onstrations would be composed
ol students and faculty mem-
bers.

Although only 15 ol the so
said they would be uncomfort-
able with 3 Dow representative
on campus, thirty-five said they
would demonstrate against Dow.
Four said they would see the
Dow representative it he came.
None were seniors. More than
half said that the college should
not allow representatives of the
military to recruit on campus.
About the same number were
opposed to the college's allow-
ing the C.I.A. to recruit on Cam-
pus, Nine men and one woman
were interested in talking to a

military recruiter on campus
and eight were interested in
talking with a representative of
the OLA.

Thirty men and thirty women
responded to the questionnaire
and there were approximately
equal numbers from each class.
One faculty member filled out
the questionnaire, and lie in-

that day, the ladies said, the
mimeograph machines were
all out-ot-order. The Service
Bureau people promised Heli-
gott they would have the
copies by 8 mm. the next day.

But early Tuesday morning
otter assembling his group and

repnring them to stnii mail-

oxes, Heligott was told that

the Service Bureau would not
run off the document in (pres-
tion with or without Prof. Ca-
nary’s sponsorship.

Dean Winters told them.
Heligott said, that “your ma-
terial is too controversial and
will not be run all."

, NEGRDES REPUDIATE
; hovcon

But while Helfgott’s predom-
hrantly White planning group
was jousting with the College
administration and Service Bu-
reau, a group of about sixty
students — almost all Negroes
._ met Monday night.

The group did not decide on
a name, a future program, or
even the lime {or another meet-
ing.

It did decide on a president
._ North Younker junior Hu—
bert Farbes.

Forbes, representing “around
lety of us," told the 5&3
that the group did not support
Helfgott‘s boycott and would
have nothing to do with a boy-
out in the lawn of Grinnell.

He told l-leligott the same
thing Tuesday.

But repudiation notwithstand~
ing, Helfgott went down to
Grinnell Office Supply and ran
off “a few" copies of the Col-
legersuppressed document, put
them on posters reading
“THINK ABOUT IT . . .
THERE ARE ELEMENTS ON
THIS CAMPUS WHICH BE-
LIEVE THIS INFORMATION
IS TOO CONTROVERSIAL
AND SHOULD NOT BE DIS-
TRIBUTED T0 STUDENTS,”
and posted them in the college
postoiiice, the Quad dinner
line, and the bulletin board at
Cowles.

“There have been many in-
stances of derogatory name-
c allin g (‘Nigger,' ‘Jigaboo,’
etc.) from high school kids,"
the poster read, “who are not
picky and will shout something

MAX HELFGO'IT

at any readily identiﬁable eth-
nic group."
INCIDENTS FINALLY CITED

It then cited instances of
deliberate attempts by towns-
men to run down Negro stu-
dents and faculty members
with automobiles, lack of help
from the local police in situ«
rations where Negroes were ver-
bally and physically accosted
in the Iown, and occasions in
which the College could but did
not, his charges against townie
aggressorsl

A ﬁnal alleged instance of
Negro harassment summarized
a confrontation between mem~
bers of the Oscar Lindsay Trio
and town bullies after a cam-
pus concert last Friday night.

“It was fortunate no fight
was threatened," the poster
concluded, “b e c a u s e each
member of the Trio was car-
rying a .38 caliber pistol."

By 7 pm. Monday night all
but one poster (the one in
Cowles) had been torn down,
and the one remaining bad the
last incident effaccd with
marking pens or various colors.

Helfgott‘s troubles were just
beginning.

One oi the students present
at the TriOrBully confrontation
at Wayne's Steakhouse (“the
Rex”) denied that the Trio car-
ried guns and told Helfgott —
rather vehemently —— to re-
move her name from the pos.
ters.

Mr. Canary became reluc-
tant to sponsor the petition,
Helfgott found himself “tallb
ing continually (or three days
without sleep" explaining the
entire mess to “everyone on
campus."

Heligott spent the next few
days visiting President Glenn
Leggett (at Heligott’s own re«
quest), explaining his actions
to the student Senate Wednes-
day night (at the Senate’s re
quest) and considering the fu~
ture of the boycott idea.

HE’S NOT SORRY

Asked if he was sorry for
ever considering the boycott,
Heligott said.

“No, I’m sorry for the cons
fusion that resulted from the
early release or information to
the wrong people — which is
again my fault and for which
I must take all responsibility

(Continued on Page I)

By JOSHUA SACHS

The meetings which have tak-
en place in the last week are
a ﬁrst response to the harass
ment of Negro students irorn
the college by some elements of
the town of Grinnell.

The students feel that the at-
mosphere in the town is hostile
to them. “Whenever you're
downtown," said Junior Howard
Ward, “You get sneered at.”
He added, though, that the mer-
chants are friendly and that
the trouble comes mostly from
high school students.

Resident adviser Zelte Craw-
ford recalled being called ”nig-
ger” while out on dates in the
town. He also said that some-
one tried to start a fight with
him one night at the Pizza Pub.
He reported neither incident,
saying, “What can you do? You
can't pin it down to anyone."
Crawford added that he did not
know or a single Negro student
here who has not been subjected
to some harassment,

GET IT EVERY DAY

Professor Denis de Coteau
echoed Crawford‘s statement.
He said that he had had two
incidents in October, nothing
since then, but that be under-
stood that “Negro students get
it every day." De Coteau a-
greed with Word that the tmw
ble is mostly from some high
school students doing "what
they think is fun.”

Senior Mike Dejole agreed
that by and large his relations

DEAN RICHARD WINTERS

with the town have been friend-
ly. He said his only trouble has
been with town resident Jim
Slebiska.
SLEBISKA-KELLEY

Slebiska has been implicated
in several unpleasantries, the
most noteworthy being a light
last year with Lou Kelley. Ac-
cording to Kelley, he (Kelley)
had been at the "Rex” one night
when a fight broke out outside
between Slebiska and student
David Price. Lﬂu said he went
out to watch and that Slebiska,
shouting “i hate niggers worse
than anything," leit Price to go
after Kelley. Lou tried to get
away but was prevented by a
ring of townies watching the
fight. He at last escaped and
got back to his hall, where
Slebiska appeared a few min-

utes later and attacked him
again. The police arrived and
led Slebiska away. What hap-
pened afterward is uncertain.

Kelley Said that neither the
police not the college at»
pmached him to see if he would
press charges. President Leggett
and Dean Thompson both as-
sured the 8&3 that the college
is willing to prosecute but that
no students Could be found to
testify. The whole matter is
confused.

Slebiska told sophomore
Grady Murdock several days
ago that Chief Peters told him
that he was not to be in any
establishment in Grinnell at the
same time as a Negro. Grady
feels that Slebiska is inﬂuencing
ﬂ'le conduct of the students from
the high school towards the Ne-
gro students, but Slebiska said
that he doesn't like the high

school people and wants nothing
to do with them.

TOWN UNAWARE

Most incidents of harassment
do not seem to have been re-
ported to the college or the
police. However, President Leg-
gett said that he called the
meeting last Sunday at Grinnell
House because several Negro
students had reported occur-
rences. This meeting was at—
tended by Leggett, several pro
minent townspeople, including
Chief Peters and Rev. John Hed-
ger, and Negro students Lou
Kelley, Grady Murdock and Roy
Walker. Most of the people in
volved in this meeting felt that
its value lay in inior-rning the
townspeople that the problem
exists.

Most people in the town seem
to have been unaware of the
problem. Prof. de Coteau re<
lates how “after Martin Luther
King spoke, one of the owners
of McNally's came to me say-
ing, ‘That man King sure is
fantastic. Thank God we don’t
have anything like that in this
town.’ I told him an hour and
a half of incidents that I had
heard about and by the time I
was done he was nearly crying.
He had no idea that things like
that were going on."

Rev. Hedger of the St. Paul’s
Episcopal Church, and director
of its student center, told the
San that most of the townsmen
at the meeting were unaware

that incidents against Negro stu-
dents were frequent and that
friction and resentment were
growing. He fell: this was partly
because Negro students and pro«
lessors had been understandably

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

REVEREND JOHN HEDGER

reluctant to discuss these ems
barrassing occurrences.

The Negro students tended to
explain the lack ot reports dif-
ferently. They express the opin-
iun that many incidents con-
tained conduct ugly and alien.
sive, but not illegal. When
asked whether reports had been
held back for fear of retaliation
from some town residents,
Grady Murdock replied, “Hell,
no."

Lou Kelley agreed that ”a lot
of people in the town were
made aware of things that they
hadn't known before.” He felt
the townspeople were sincerely
ignorant of the situation, not
just covering up.

In a meeting held last weelf
by Chief Peters. and the auxili-
ary police, Peters said that
most incidents had never been
reported. He urged that any
harassment, however trivial, be
reported at once to the police.

BEING BLIND

Other people were not so con.
vinced. Professor tie Cnteau
thought Peters bad a tendency
to play down everything that
has happened as unimportant.
"is he waiting tor something to
really happen?” he asked.

Grady Murdock said "I’m sort
of skeptical that they were tali-
en entirely by surprise. The
meeting helped to direct con-
sciousness." Sophomore Frank
Thomas said, "quite often when
incidents occur there is a Cou-
casion present. This is not a
matter of being unaware, but of
being blind.“

Already, attempts are being
made to alleviate the tension.
President Lsggett considered his
meeting a beginning and ex-
pressed tbe hope that subsequent
events, such as a rumor that
the college would boycott the
town would not make things
more difficult.

Rev, Hedger obviously Con-
cerned over the incidents, inr
formed the 5&3 that he had
preached about the problem

[ went to the Pizza Pub Mom
dly night to talk to Jim Slehise
kn. Everyone on campus knows
bir name: he’s “the big tough
irom town who beat up Lou
Kelley twice one night last
Spring. and has been harassing
Negroes in town all year” —
or so the story goes. His name
is always the lirst mentioned
when town . college problems
are discussed, and I wanted to
find out why.

when I walked Into the Pub,
Jim was at the bar ~ drinking
u coke. Beer Wasn't agreeing
with him today, he said. With
u remark to the people at the
bar that he was going to a back
room where they couldn’t hear
what he was going to tell me,
we sat down in one of the hack
booths, We each had a coke
Before 1 could ask a question,
Jim started.

“I knoiv why you’re here.
Whenever there’s any trouble,
my name comes up. There's
one reason (or that — Lou Kel-
ley. We tangled one night. He’s
supposed to be the tough col-
lege kid, and I’m the town bad

Was the fight a racial issue?
"No’ it wasn’t even Kelley’s

he thought he could get a

weren't around. So I asked
some other kids Where the Ne-
groes were They said ‘down at

so i went down there. We got to

law came and broke it up,

and told me Kelley wanted to

Here's what happened. I was

didn't think anything about it.
The next day one oi the wait-
resses told me that a white girl
jumped up and kissed one ot
the Negroes, but I didn't even

Do you think your views
about Negroes are typical oi
Grinnell townspeople? “Well,

Anne Taylor’s weekly CAMPUS NOTES column on
page eight carries a head set in ST. CLAIR type face.

ST. CLAIR _ sometimes known as “circus type”
_ became popular in the Midwestern United States
around 1875 and is usually used only tor headlines; it
“has a grey eiiect in mass use,” according lo a ty-
pographers’ handbook or the period.

The new head this week on PERSONALS (also
page eight) is set in KISMET, designed by Boston
printer John Cumming in 1879. Horace Gi‘eeley’s New
York WEEKLY TRIBUNE eventually used this type
iooe tor its Personals column late in the century.

LETI‘ERS TO THE EDITOR and NEWS BRIEFS
stel (that is, standing) heads on our editorial pages
are set in ALFERTA — perhaps the most interesting
of classic American type styles.

ALFERTA displays a deﬁnite exotic inﬂuence
with Spanish overtones; it was designed by w. F.
Capitaine in 1351.

Capitaine went to Chicago iollowing the Great Fire,
and Illis lace developed — it is said ~— mm the vivid
commentaries he read by the (tree‘s witnesses.

ALFERTA can “heat a display,” one modern type

In August 1967, Douglas Tur-
ner Ward, a 37-year old black
playwright and winner oi an
“Obie” tor the best off-Broad-
way play of 196657, wrote an
arllcle for the N.Y. Times Sun-
day theater section. He men-
tioned that he would like to
work in a Negro oriented theA
ater, and as a result, the Ford
Foundation approached, and
asked him to make a proposal
tor the type or theater he en-
visioned. With the aid of Negro
actor Robert Hooks, and pro-
ducer Gerald S. Krone, a white
man, an idea was developed.

The proposal resulted in a
$430,000 grant from Ford, and
this past Iall, the Negro En-
semble Company was formed.

“ert'l’ em up if they don’t deliver!"

He Says What He Thinks

When it comes to seeking candid comments,
you’re a hell of lot better off talking to Big Jilin Sle-
biska in town than talking to Negro students on this
campus.

At least Big Jim will tell you what he thinks.

Based on the evidence volunteered —- the in-
stances of verbal or physical aggression against Ne-
gro students actually reported by them — there
would seem to be no problem in the town of Grin-
nell, Iowa.

But there is.

After interviewing almost everyone involved,
only a handful of incidents were agreed on by Ne-
groes at the College.

But ask the same students — so reluctant to re-
port their own individual confrontations with the
townies —— if there is imminent racial violence in
Grinnell, and you'll find their feathers highly ruf-
ﬂed.

By now it should be obvious to everyone that
students don’t have to go to Chicago or Des Moines
to find incidents of racial hatred.

A lot of people ought to be nailed up for the
‘trouble they’ve caused.

Everyone from Grinnell Chief of Police Bill
Peters to Boycott-planner Max Helfgott agrees that
the College could have and should have pressed
charges against townie aggressors in a number of
instances.

Most people agree that the Police could have
and should have acted more quickly in potentially-
dangerous and often physically-damaging confron-
tations between town bullies and Negro college stu-
dents.

And a good number of people rightfully think
that the Grllinell College White majority should be
morally indicted for apathy in the face of danger
to their Black fellows.

But you can’t nail up anybody without evidence
and support.

And until Negro students become willing to re-
port what happened . . . until both White and Ne-
gro students realize that quiet, lazy discussions
aren’t the only solutions to which they can com-
mit themselves . . . until the College adminstration
is jolted by tragedy to act first and think about
town-gown rapport later. 1 . until the activists learn
to plan before jumping to guns and boycotts . it
seems pretty unlikely the trouble will decline.

Max Helfgott acted too soon. He admits it, and
there's no sense crucifying him for an error of judg-
ment in the form of an information leak.

The College and the Police haven't acted quick-
ly enough, and maybe they can learn their lesson
before the real —— now potential — trouble starts,

The Negroes haven't been candid enough in the
face of actual investigation. They remain covert and
self-shrouded in mistrust, mysteriousrless, and
secrecy.

And Big Jim —— stereotyped the town bully ——
has simply got to be congratulated God help him,
he thinks he’s acting for the town of Grinncll.

But at least he says what he thinks.

As usual, when the Admin-
istration is contempiaiing a
basic change the students have
been kept in the dark as to
what the change will involve or
who it will effect,

More often than not the rea-
son ior this “lack of commune
icatinn” has been that the Ad»
ministration itsell doesn‘t know
what is going on.

This vacuum of knowledge at
or from the top has caused
rumors m be thrown at the un.
Wary student with such rapid-
ity that it is sometimes diiiiclllt
to separate the rumors from
the divine oracles. But sums
ideas do stand in the lore-
ground as actually being pr0<
posals.

The most certain of these
proposals is the principle ct
alternating dorms or at least
coeducational campuses, not to
be coniused with coeducational
dorms.

Dear Mrs. Low: Why on
earth would you want to co
educate, or rather integrate,
the campuses it there will re»
suit the same delineation be~
tween purely male domain and
female? I refer to the south
campus wall system. What dit-
terence is there to men remain.
ing solely on North Campus
than to being placed at the
southern extremity of South
Campus?

1 can think of few things
that might help the social situ-
stion at Grinnell better than
alternating dorms, Yes. alter-
nate, like Mears: womentl
Main: men; Cleveland: women.
This would keep men and wom-
en out or each: other's halls,
but would still give the atmos-
phere of one uniﬁed campus
and not two separate and dis-
tinct ones, How about making
Meal-s and Main the same sex
as East and West? Now it's I
long walk for a guy late on
Saturday night returning from
his chivalrous escorting of his
date to her "door".

The second most obvious pro-
posal, it not now a tact, comes
to us as the allacampus mom
draw. In my opinion the status
gun is far superior.

Men, being what they are,
prefer rather set groups oi
friends, at least to live with.
When u freshman is placed in
a hall, he must mold himself
to his new environment, as he
will have in do under ”its new
system. But as it stands now
that male will remain in his
group of rather intimate iriends
unless he wishes to leave his
hall, which he is tree to do.

Okay, I put in my plug for
the old system. Well at least
someone has come ollt into the
open and defended a View, 1‘5-
gardless of its merit.

As things stand now Bur-ling
Basement had better get busy
and drop some more proposals.

LIBERATION NEWS
SERVICE

After midnight on July 14,
1967, l and my companions
were driving in my station Wa'
gnn, talking and listening to the
radio. As we reached the cor-
ner of South Orange Ave, which
was on our direct route home,
we were stopped by at least two
carloads of white-helmeted po-
lice with shotguns and several
detectives. They advanced on
our van; we thought that at
most they would check us out,
ask ibr identiﬁcations, etc,
then let us go.

We were told to come out of
the car. When i opened the
door and stepped down, one de-
tective, whom i recognized as
having once attended Harrig-
get High School while i was
there, reached up to me,
acreaming that "we were the
bastards" who had been shoot-
ing at them. “Yes," he said.
“a blue panel truck." (My
station wagon is an olive-green
camper bus.) I said that we
had not been shooting at any-
one. I told the officer that I
thought i remembered him
from high school — whereupon
he hit me in the face and threw
me up against the side of the
truck. (The others had also
been taken from the truck.)

The detective then began to
tab me as hard as he could
with his pistol in my stomach,
asking, “Where are the guns?"
I told him there were no guns.
Suddenly it seemed that five
or six of the officers surround-
ed me and began to beat me.
i was hit perhaps rive times
on top of my head by night-
sticks, and when I tell, some of
the officers Went about me-
thodically trying to break my
hands, elbows and shoulders.
One oiticer tried to kick me in
the groin — and there were
many punches thrown. As they
beat, they kept calling me,
"Animal,” and asking me,
“Where are the guns?” Inside
the wagon, the beating con-
tinued. They took us from the
wagon and as I was pushed
up the stairs at Police Head~
quarters, an officer called out,
"Wait a minute,” then punched
me in the pit of the stomach.

I fell to the ground clutching
my stomach.

Inside the station, Mr. Spfna
(the Police Director) was
standing behind the desk. I
asked him had he ordered me
beaten. He replied, “They got
you, didn't they?” — smiling.
An officer then grabbed me,
asked me to take off my belt.
He ran his hand in my pocket,
pulling out my wallet . . . later
I discovered that the officer
had taken about $65.00 and I

We were taken to City Hos
pital; i was dragged in and
handcuffed in a wheelchair.
The “doctors" put in eight or
nine Stitches. (At no time were
we allowed to make a phone

We were then taken to police
headquarters on Franklin St.,

the courtroom and arraigned.
The prosecutor asked for $25.-

allowed. I was taken to Essex

confinement, where i remained
until I was released. (All mo-
tions for lowering the bail were
denied.)

The NEC feels that the black
audience it does develop will be
an audience raised on quality
theatre. “They Won’t be getv
ting Broadway reruns, or Ne-
gro versions of “Hello, Dolly,"
a company spokesman said.
“They'll be a better group of
theater goers.” The NEC finds
predominantly black audiences
more responsive than predom-
inantly white audiences. They
find that black people come to
the theater with less precon-
cepticins than do white people,
and that their reactions are
"freer.”

The first play chosen by the
Negro Ensemble Company was
by a white man, Peter Weiss,

'i'i-iE dIGHT

By
Wm. F. BUCKLEY, Jr.

You will have noticed that Mr. Clark Clifford, our forthcoming
Secretary of Defense, has been coy on the question whether he in
a hawk or ii dove, disdaining, as he put it, “such ornithological
categories." But the wisemen in Washington tell us that he is Com
vinced of the tightness of the Vietnam war, and indeed it is on:
likely that President Johnson would have appointed to sit at hll
left hand someone who substantially disagreed with him on so im-
portant a question. It has even been whispered that Mr. Clifford
will pursue the objectives of victory in Vietnam more wholeheart-
edly than Mr. McNamara did, about whom the insider: tell of
great agonizing over the entire matter, an agonizing which can-
not compare with the agonizing of American soldiers as they hear
shells drop over them which were manufactured in the Soviet
Union and found their way to the war front because Mr. McNa-
mara — and Mr. Johnson -— agnnlze over world opinion.

But let us assume that the conduct of the Vietnam war will
proceed more or less at the pace or the last year or two, and hope
that the cumulative pressures on North Vietnam will begin to tell.
and that before long the military creaking and groaning will abate.
What then? What; will we see after it is over in Vietnam? A period

of peace in the Southeast Asian part of the world we are entitled to
expect.

But history teaches us the unlikelihood that there will be peacd
everywhere in the world. And all the less likely considering the
techniques of the modern revolutionists, who have learned to cause
so much disturbance with so few men.

The Sty-called wars of liberation are certain to prove to be lit.
military Model A Ford of the 20th Century — cheap, durable, and
ubiquitous. All It takes is a couple of thousand guerrillas. I pipe-
line to the soviet union, a local Che Guevara, and you are in
business. Inasmuch as the United States is primarily charged with
the responsibilities of counteraction, it is we who need to think be-
yond the Vietnam war and ask ourselves whether we are willing
again in pay so lilgh - price as we will have paid in Vietnam in
order to contain other national liberation fronts in other parts of
the world.

Mr. Clifford should turn his attention to the problem, and sure-
ly the place to start would be by announcing a future commitment
to the volunteer army. If you like, to the mercenary army. The
arguments in favor of it have been frequently rehearsed, as re-
cently as in 1964 by both the presidential candidates. As is so often
the case with election year promises, nothing has been done, noth-
ing in this case to phase out the draft. Perhaps the reason why is
the great manpower demands of the Vietnam war. But that is no
reason tor putting off a public discussion of the volunteer military,
and it is always appropriate to bigthink about strategic matters
upon taking the oath of niiice.

The conventional arguments are that, e) a professional force
renders professional services. As things now stand, an American
technician becomes highly qualified, highly useful. by let us say
June, and in September his tour of duty is over. b) The extra cost
or luring men into a professional military force is not likely to
exceed the great cost of continually training the millions of young
men whose services are used over so short a period. To which con-
venrional argument should he added, {1) the great commotion
caused by a draft, and the influence Of that commotion on the
formulation of an effective foreign policy backed up by a mobile
armed iorce. ii the United States is going to help out next year in
Brazil, the year after in the Sudan, and the year after that in Ni-
geria, surely we do nor want to replay the tensions of the existing
war? it is bad enough to contemplate another haltrcentury of ti-
nancing resistance to the Communists throughout the world, but it
is more than flesh and blood can bear to contemplate a Slyyear
old Dwight Macdonald relusing ills 25th consecutive invitation to
the White House.

The influence of American youth and their epigoni. ihe inlel~
ieciuais, the academicians, the opinion-makers, the noisemakers,
on foreign policy is considerable, and in some ways heallhy. Their
indisposition to go and fight in these grubby wars in grubby parts
of life \Vnrld is altogether understandable. But until we simply
give up on the rest of the world, we have got to help out. And the
way to do that is primarily by making arms available, and also
small, professional forces which will absorb the Shock until such
moment as the locals are trained to attend to their own defense.

Perhaps someone in Washington will be good enough to quel-
tion Mr. Clifford on the matter at his next press conference.

should decide what recruiters

The total number of re-
sponses to the question exceeds
60, the number of question-
naires returned, because many
people thought that the deci-
sion should be a result of con-
lultatiort from several ele-
menu.

in comments appended to the
questionnaire, many students
registered opposition to obstruc-
tionist tactics oi demonstration,
arguing for the necessity of pro-
tecting. the right or students
who wish to hold job inter
views.

Other comments concerned
the question of “who should de-
cide what recruiters to allow
on campus A junior suggested
a “policy committee." The same
student was in favor of all mili-
tary and industry recruitment
being held oil-campus — a senth
ment repeated also in comments
by other respondents. A fresh-
man thought that students
alone should decide ”since we're
paying for the iacilities here."

The “comments" section also
showed a typical collection at
the currently popular campus
declarations about war, Dow
and recruitment. A senior to
epondent opined, “No college
or university has In obligation
to provide recruitment tuciuties

tor murders (sic) and govern<
meat spies.”
A sophomore penned the fol-

lowing conglomerate. “I do not
believe that an educational in-
stitution should allow military
recruitment on its campus. I
believe that in doing so it in
complying with an unjust war.
It is not the place of a free
thinking institution to take poll-
tical stance. it is an instituﬂon
at many beliefs."

Another student expressed his
reaction to this type of reason-
ing. “it is beyond my under-
standing why the so-called Lih.
eral Zealots are so dedicated
to tree association, but are so
hostile to the practice of that
entity when it goes against their
ideology."

PAPER ERIPERS

NEWTON, Kan, Jan. 31
(ACP) — You could put your
gripe in the student govem-
mellt's suggestion box or write
a letter to the editor of the
college paper. Or you could tell
it to the world from a soapbox.

But at Bethel College in New-
ton, Kansas, the Collegian re-
ports, you go to an old storage
room in the southeast corner oi
the student union.

It's an “hostility room,"
where students release their
hostilities (and entertain them-
selves and others) by writing
on the paper-covered walls.

The hostility room was the
iirst step in a student govem-
merit project at Bethel to im-
pmve communication with the
student body.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 (CPS)
—'i‘iie Presidential commission
studying last summer’s riots will
deliver its tlnal repolt several
months ahead of its Original
deadline, with much oi its re-
search incomplete, because its
researchers' iindings didn’t jibe

ministration wantedt

As is, a newsletter on civil
rights and community action
edited by Dave Steinberg oi the
National Student Association,
says the commission’s admin-
istrative stati suppressed much
of what the researchers had
found.

As an example, As is says

,the researchers round in one

city that “there was no ques<

AS IS says that faced with
these reports, the Administra-
tive Sta.“ oi the commission,
in consultation with the White
House, decided Il'lat this infor-
mation had to be suppressed be-
cause:

It “would embarrass too many
people in an election year,"

—“There would be too iew
kind words for local police, or
for local political leaders."

H'Ihe report “could only sup‘
port an outcry tor radically im
creased iederal expenditure."
while the President is cuttlng

expenses at the Woman: war.

So the final deadline for the
commission report was moved

cording to As Is:

Activists Beware] Sedentary is the word ior weekend on the
ole Grinnell oampus. Our intellectuals may have something to
blow their minds on, however, because the gist of this weekend‘s
activities ale directed toward stretching their minds. But for those
at you whose minds fatigue more easily than your bodies there are
some events bent on expending all your pent up energies.

Friday night, l'm afraid, will not alleviate the student‘s tediurn
oi reclining or rather draping one’s self all over or in a seat. How
ever, you will iind its mental exercise less exhausting than an av-
erage Biology lecture.

At 8 pm. in South Lounge, Jorge Luis Borges. the prominent
ﬁrgentinian writer and critic will be lecturing on The an or Writ-

g.

This lecture may prove extremely interesting to you buddln
creative writers, however, do not be alarmed ii in the backgroung
you hear those wailing voices of despairing Spanish majors who
are also connoisseurs oi Grinnell’s concert programs.

If it’s not obvious already, Paul Hersh's Piano and Viola R94
cital will be held concurrently in Roberts Theatre, Hersh, a mem.
ber of Grinnell's own LenDX Quartet, will be assisted this evening
by Joan Purswell, an associate oi our Music Department from
iowa City. Their program will include Bach’s ltalian Concerto
Mozart's sonata in A Minor, and Sonata in F Minor for Viola and
Piano by Brahms.

Later at lo pm. and again on Sunday at 9 p.m., you flick tid<
diets will find a short respite in ARH where The Swindler, an early
Fellini production, will be shown, ‘

And last but not least, all you funrseekers may work out All
your frustrations at the Bowladrome from 1 until 12 where you
may bowl tree of charge by the hour.

On Saturday night {or all you terpsicholean fanatics, the
W.R.A., with the assistance of the South Campus Social Chairmen,
will be presenting the traditional Dance lntramurais in Robert:
Theatre at 8 pm. The subject ior this year's extravaganza u
Happiness is . . . Five of the women’s halls will be competing inl-
prizes awarding points toward their annual Intramural trophy.
Mrs. Parssmen, Mrs. Durkee, Mr. Gale, Mrt Ingham and Mr. Hor-
toll will be Judging each hall's dances on technique and composi-
tion, theme and continuity, costumes and music. For your addi-
tional entertainment the Scarleteerli and the Tanagels will be per-
forming.

it by 9:30 Saturday night you have only tired at resting upon
your posterior, migrate to North Lounge where you will ﬁnd the
X L’s, a group from lowa City, pounding out primitive rhythmical
beats. They promise to he as good in Grinnell, lowa, as they were
on the silver screen in Hollywood.

At 10:30 in ARH our Economics majors as well as all you
protagonists followers, will eye-witness a documentary on a Medi.
eval incomedistribution scheme or more mundanely The Adven-
tures of Robin Hood.

And it by now, you have not found the needed panacea for
your study doldrums, i suggest that you find (our dollars and buy
yourself a round—trip Greyhound ticket to Des Moines (or the
weekend.

(Note: Last September If
and I5, William Hfggs, a
Washington lawyer noted for
his work in civu rights cases,
revealed to THE EVENING
STAR in Washington docu-
ments proving beyond reas-
onable doubt that Alriie
House, a huge conference
center in \Varrenton, Va.
which is used by many gov-
ernment agencies for “think
sessions,“ Is firmly under the
control of, and has been ﬂ-
named by, several govem-
merit agencies, notably the
CIA, ln addition, Higgs
proved that the entire conten
ence center is elaborately
bugged for sound and taping.

THE EVENING STAR re
ceived I! call from Richard
Helms, director of the CIA,
and on Sept. 19, it publicly
apologized for its two articles
based on Higgs’ information,
asserting that Airlie is entire-
ly financed by independent
sources. But in a letter to
THE STAR written subse-
quently, Higgs pointed out
that THE STAR had exam-
ined only the tax and rev-
enue data from Airlie‘s 1968
records, and reasserted that
it is the present control, and
not the present ﬁnancing, of
the center that determines
its legitimacy.

Airlie House is suddenly In
the news this week, a the
International Association of
Chiefs of Police have chosen
It as their meeting place.
The police chiefs employed
one Negro consultant through
last August, but since then
have remained a completely
white group. Last week,
Mrs. Willie Hardy, Washing-
ton ghetto mother andror~
ganizer, Went to warrentnn
to confront the police but
was tnmed away loroetully.

Meanwhile, Higgs has com-
pleted this account of the
history and control of what
probably is the most impor-
tant confelenoe center opera-
tive in this country.)

I: THE CIA IN
DOMESTIC POLITICS

WASHINGTON, D.C., Jan. 22
(LNS) — in the wake of the
Ramparts magazine expose of
the CIA’s relations with the
National Student Association
(Feb, 1967), the executive
branch of the U.S. government
— of necessity deeply involved
in the shenanigans — moved
swiftly to contain the extent of
the revelation breach.

The President appointed on
February 15 a special commit-
tee chaired by Under Secre-
tary of State Nicholas Katzen—
bach, with NEW Secretary
John Gardner and CIA Direc-
tor Richard Helms as the other
two members. The committee
was instructed, in Katzenbach’s
words, “to formulate a policy
that will provide necessary
guidance for government agen-
cies in their relationship to the
international a c t i V i t i e s of
American educational organiza»
tions."

Five weeks later the special
committee delivered its report
to LBJ. It contained a basic
ltatement oi policy:

No Federal Agency shall pro-
vide my cover! ﬁnancial u-

A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED EXPOSE

sistance or support, direct or
indirect, to any of the Nation‘s
educational or private volun-
tary organizations. This policy
specifically applies to all for-
eign activities of such organi-
zations and it reaffirms pres
ent policy with respect to their
domestic activities.

Just to nail the matter down
the committee added a foot-
note:

If the Statement of Policy is
to be effective, it must be rig-
orously enforced.

it is clear from the policy
statement that all covert finan—
cial aid — lrom any agency of
the federal government — is to
be promptly ended. Such was
the popular interpretation of
the Presidents’ immediately
ordering the policy statement
into effect.

As part of its containment
policy, the CIA drew the lor-
eign versus domestic line: the
Agency only dealt with foreign
matters, of. in the case of the
NSA, with an organization that
was engaged in activity in the
ioreign ﬁeld. The spy depart
ment steadfastly maintained
that it had gotten into domes-
tic affails.

The truth of the matter, how-
ever, is that the CIA, the State
and Defense Departments, and
the nation’s intelligence sys-
tem has been intimately and
secretly involved in the guid-
lag and pulse-taking of domes-
tio thought and politics.

The instrument of this com«
prehensive program is a little-
known conference center about
40 miles west south west of
Washington, just off US. high-
way 50, called Airlie House.

The operator of Airiie is Dr.
Murdock Head, a mansior-aii-
seasons Who holds professional
degrees in dentistry (Louis
ville), medicine (Vermont). and
law (G e o r g e Washington).
Born in Trinity, Texas, about
1923, Head remains a rather
mysterious tigure, even though
the Saturday Evening Post,
Newsweek, and other maga-
zines have had feature articles
concerning his work at Airlie.

According to an Airlie bra-
chure, the center is run by Air«
lie Foundation, a non-profit
Virginia corporation. Airlie’s
source oi funds, however, is to
say the least ambiguous In its
June 23, 1562 article. the Satur-
day Evening Post referred to
Airlie as “a $2,000,000 set-up
financed by Head and private
benefactors.”

In Newsweek of March 16,
1964, is the Comment: “Head
launched Airlie House seven
years ago with a small person<
al inheritance and bluntless en-
Ihusiasm. Borrowing additional
money from insurance com-
panies and banks. he estab»
lished the non-profit Airlie
Foundation, now Worth $2 to $3
million.”

in an interview with Head in
the Sunday Magazine section
of the Washington Star of Aug»
ust 11, 1963, reference is made

to the wealth of Heads wife’s
parents from Louisville, Ky,
together with extensive borrow-
ings irum banks and insurance
Companies.

Airlie is situated in the bean-
tiful rolling hunt. country of
northern Virginia. The ram-
bling conference center over-
looks a scenic pond and is only
part or a remarkably complete
complex of private clinic, ra-
dio station, cattle barn, sauna
baths, game lodge, stables,
swimming pool, guest houses,
and private airport.

In essence, Airlie House is
an ideal conference center. As
the brochure truthfully states:

Agency, the U.S. Public Health
Service and the Internal Rev»
enue Service.

Airlie is a frequent location
tor many of the nation’s pri-
vate organizations, such as
universities and social organi-
zations. For example, the
NAACP Legal Defense Fund
has consistently used Airlie to
bring togedier civil rights law-

Justices of the Supreme Court,
members of the White House
staff, Cabinet members, and
leaders of American economic,
intellectual and social life have
enjoyed the peaceful serenity
of the rustic 1,200 acre site.

A little detail will give some
idea of Airlie’s role on the
frontier of the nation’s life.

Beginning in about 1961 the
center hosted groups from al-
most every agency of the U.S.
guvemment, including the
White House, the State Departr
merit, the Bureau of the Bud-
get, the Congress of the United
States, the Agency for lnter—
national Development, the
Community Relations Service.

yers and leaders from over the
country

A great many of the out-
standing lacidty members from
institutions of higher learning
throughout the nation have
come to Airlie tn Exchange
views and ideas in its atmos-
phere of quiet Isolation.

The Scholarship, Education
and Defense Fund for Racial
Equality — the tax-exempt olf—
shoot of CORE — conducted a
fourrday training session on
Aug. 19, 1967, to instruct 35
new Negro school board mem-
bers from southern states in
school administration and pol-
icy-making.

On May 26, 1965, over 100
prominent Americans attended
a “Strategy for Peace" confer-
ence, which focused in on the
problems of Communism and
insurgency in the underdevel-
oped world. Conference chair<
man was Dr. Kenneth Young.
former Ambassador to Thai-

cho Eleven

land, current President of tho
Asia Society and chairman of
the State Department’s advis‘
ory panel on Southeast Asia. A’
national columnist commented
“The Airlie House Report Will
be studied by many unless of
the government and not least
in the White House.’ ’

Twenty-five nationally promi-
nent Latin American Scholars
met an Oct. 9, 1565, {or two
days with top Administration
men to discuss U.S. policy in
Latin America toward military
dictatorships and Communist
insurgencies. The government
was represented, among oth-
ers, by McGeorge Bundy, spe-
cial assistant to the President
for National Security Alrairs,
Jack Hood Vaughn, Assistant
Secretary of State for Latin
American Affairs, and Leonard
Marks, Director of the U.S. In
formation Agency.

on Jan, 28, 1966, 40 top po
lice off 'als from 17 major
US. cities met to consider new
techniques and systems of law
enforcement. The conference
was jointly arranged by the
Depamneht of Justice and the
International Chiels of Police.

The White House Conference
on Mental Retardation wan
held at Airlie on Sept. 19, 1963.
The meeting was attended by
ﬁcials and its tone was set by
top-ranking Administration of-
iicials and its tone was set by
B message from i118 President.

On Jan. 4, l967, the House

It must be emphasized: Th6

very few of the very many top-
level conferences and meetings
held at Airlie. They have oc-
curred almost without interrupt

In the Center‘s conference
rooms, in is guest rooms, on

horseback riding on its lovely

SCORE FLYING PUCKS

By ALAN BERNHARDT
5&3 staff Writer

Mike Schafier, an enterpris
log sophomore, has brought a
new sound to the Grinnell cam~
pus. No, he’s not the organizer
of a band, but of a hockey club.
The sound is of a shap shot re-
sounding off the boards of Bar-
ber Plaza Ice Arena.

The sign on the side of the
rink warns: “No games of ally
kind", but Mike has Changed
that. He has made arrangements
for the hockey club to practice,
bought equipment, scheduled

, games, secured funds and is
teaching people to play hockey.

There are now twenty-two

, members who practice two
nights a week.

They played three games last

- semester and have played again
this semester. s.

Last year Mike and Steve
Gausebeck got the idea of get-
ring some interested students
together a couple of times a
week to play hockey. They se-

cured permission irom Miss
King to use the rink two nights
a week from 10 to 12 pint, and
Sunday morning.

At that time there were about
eight or ten people who played.

The only problem they en-
countered was that B&G men
kept kicking them Off the rink,
explaining they had not heard
anything about hockey being
permitted.

This year about twice as many
people have been playing.

At an organizational meeting
the group decided to join the
US. Amateur Hockey Associa-
tion as the Grinnell Blades.

The meeting also elected
Schsfier captain - coach.

When Schaiier told President
Leggett about the club's plans
to play teams from other schools,
Leggett was so enthusiastic he
volunteered free use of the col-
lege wagons and box lunches
for team trips.

Schafier then went to local
merchants to secure money.
Over $120 was collected. The

After seeing my column elevated to the status where one can‘t
read the title, I feel somewhat inadequate (but not too much) in
the face of the pressure placed upon me by having an old English

Basketball commenced last Wednesday to the usual strains
of the losers trudging off the court mumbling. “It's just a game,”
and the winners triumphantly singing, “(Rawson West, South,

Recently, NBC Sports did a special photographic show of
Bernie Casey, L. A. Rams flanker, to demonstrate the poetry in

or the other gender, the w. it. A. has Ihoughtfuliy produced, for

Although the team has lost‘

Coach Schaffer is confident that
the team is at least as good as
other hockey clubs in Iowa. He
hopes to do well against other
teams in the state at the tourna-

Two of the stars on the team,

Approximately hali oi the
members of the club never
played hockey before and half
of those had never skated before.

A position it in

ii the player to move
must make a move that
will bring on his defeat.

By J. VON BRIESEN RAZ

The American economy is, perhaps. the only economy in the
World which has afforded Itself the luxury of flooding its chess
market with “indescribably bad" chess literature. As is the case
with Contract Bridge literature, publishers are content to saturate
bookstores with garbage. satisfied with the knowledge that accord-
ing to recent sales trends the public appetite is up, and justified
by the Conviction that their actions are good for the GNP. In addi«
tion to the twothirds of the world population that goes to sleep
hungry every night may be added the chess playing public.

It is a sad but olten true fact that the beginning chess player
must attain a certain proliciency in the game before he is able to
discriminate between the wealth of refuse unlit ior human Con-
sumption and the few genuine works written ior the serious player
by masters with legitimate credentials. In response to this prob
lem, Zugzwang pliers the iollowing bibliography for the expert as
well as the uninitiated. the beginner as well as the casual player.

The best beginning books have been written by the intemation~
al grandmasters: Lasker’s Manuel of Chess, by Emanuel Lasker,
The Game of Chess, by Raoul Capablanca. Abracadabra chess by
Larry Evans (found in the “American Chess Quarterly")

Concerning the diiierent phases of the game, Reuben Fine's
Basic Chess Endings is the definitive work in endgame scholar-
ships; Larry Evans' New Ideas in Chess, Aron Nlmzovich’s My
System and Chess Praxls are among the best on the middlegame;
Reuben Fine’s The Ideas Behind the Chess Openings and Proo-
tloal Chess Openings rank under the compendium, Tenth Edition
oi Modern Chess Openings, for the opening phase of the game.

Insight into the brilliant chess‘mlnds or the past century may
be gained by an investigation of Znosko—Borovsky’s The Art of
Chess Combination.

The best anthologies oi games include Aielthine's two volumes
My Best Games of Chess, Botvinnik’s 100 Selected Games of Chess,
Fisbher's Best Games of Chess, and depending upon the player’s
taste several other grandmaster: made available in Dover Publi-
cations.

For the historically minded, Modern Ideas in Chess by Richard
Reti and Imre Konig's Chess irom Morphy to Botvlnnlk: A Cen-
tury of Chess Evolution deal with chess evolution irom a fairly
technical point of view while Edward Lasker‘s The Adventure of
Chess is interesting reading for the layman.
