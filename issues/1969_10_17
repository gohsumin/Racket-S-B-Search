Students Vote to

The thousand proper parents

disappointed when they discover
that, in tact, Griirnell will have
no homecoming queen at all this

“Our department doesn't want

0n Student Decision-Making Role

By Henry Scheii

Hundreds of students iilled
Roberts Theater Tuesday night
as the Grinnell student senate
and other interested students
called for the creation Di 3
“student community" at Grin-
neil In which students will play
a substantial role in the col-
iege's decisionmalting process.

Speakers outlined issues of
student Concern in five basic
and wide-reaching a r e a s —
counseling, student social serv-
ices, social regulations, aca-
demics, and administration.

Committees were formed in
each of these areas to discuss
proposals and to elect or ap—
point live people to write a
basic student position paper in
their area, to become part of
a cohesive statement that will
be brought to the senate after
mid-sern break, discussed,
amended, and then presented
to the administration for action,
Those involved hope that this
statement will be hacked by a
majority or the student body,
and all students are being en-
couraged by the senate to par-
ticipate in the discussions and
in the formulation oi the docu~
merit.

Senator Bill Stranger started
Tuesday‘s meeting with a

brief history of the activities
that lead to the mass meeting.
A few weeks ago several inter<
ested student government mem<
hers and other students began
to question the roll of the stu-
dent at Griiiiiell College. They
set up meetings to discuss this
question and to determine the
best way to bring this issue to
the student body.

Candlelight Walk
Highlights Day of
Vietnam Protests

Over 700 students, faculty,
and townspeople braved chilly
iowri weather Wednesday night
to participate in a candlelight
procession that highlighted ii
dayrlong Vietnam Moratorium
protesting the War.

Slated as a peace vigil. the
march began at 7 pm in Main
Lounge, on South Campus. Pro-
ceeding through the loggia, then
across campus to the North
Campus loggia, the procession
added candlebearers as it
progressed, ending at Central
Park downtown

One or the many towns

the Rev. Newell E. Davis, min-
ister of the United Church 0'
Christ Congregational, who was
to speak later in the evening
during the rally at the park.

Davis explained that he did
not represent either all or his
church or even most of the
town, but spoke as air individuat
and a religious leader. “We
speak to Mr. president Nixon.

Nixon, in the name of God,

”it’s my contention that I

termination of all peoples, the
American people should \vith-
draw from Vietnam and admit
a mistake has been made.

President Glenn Leggett also
spoke at the rally as an indi-
vidual, not as a representative
of the college, Earlier in the
month, Leggett had signed a
statement along with over 75
other private college and univer-
sity presidents stating that as
individuals who Work with
young men and women, “We
urge upon the president or the
,United States and upon Con-
gress a stepped-up timetable for
withdrawal from Vietnam, We
believe this to be in our
country's highest interest, at
home and abroad” At the rally,
he reaffirmed his position by
reiterating the statement.

Professor Robert Vbertmau
(Economics) addressed himself
to actions that can be taken
that may help change the
course of the War. “I believe
that we ought all very seriously
communicate to our congress»
men, senators, and par-
ticularly to the Foreign Rea
lations Committee, and to the
Senate Armed Services Com<
mittee, concerning the removal
of appropriations tor continuing
the war in Vietnam,” he said.
Voertman also called lor t
withdrawal from Vietnam.

John Otto, a junior, related
the view or a college student.
Otto concluded his speech by
asserting that “The War will
not end. . .until the rest of
America is convinced that
apathy is no virtue, that dissent
is no vice. , t . Unless we act
now, we may relinquish our
chances to ever ettect change
again."

Although a chilly rain began
to fall during the rally, over
700 people stayed until it was
over. Aiter the rally, on all»
night Vigil was held in Herrick
Chapel.

The Moratorium, part or a
nationwide protest or United
States Vietnam policy in which
millions of Americans partici-
pated, began in Grinnell at 7:30
n.m. when students from the
college community leafleted
homes, factories, and busir
nesses in town.

At 10 2.m. in
Theater, an allrcampus and
town "teach-in” was held.
Moderated by Barry Zigas, the
ireshman who was Chairman M
the Moratorium planning
Committee at Grinnell, the
teachein featured 300 students,
taculty members, admin»
istrators and townspeople exr
changing various viewpoints
about the Moratorium itself and

two teach»in speeches, soph-
omore Jake Margolin rose to
air his views on the Mora-
torium. "I did not want to par-
ticipate in the Moratorium, and
I’m not going to,” he said. “I’m
going to leave as soon as I
say this. . . .It’s good tor us
to come up here and give good
reasons. , .about why this war
is terrible. . and how we the
people aren’t going to stand it
any more." But, said Margolin,
“Don’t: we know already that
the people don’t like the war?
Nixon already knows it ..
“I think the one thing that
people have to address them-
selves to is to tactics. Going
to Washington and marching is
not going to make any dif-
ference, and we should realize
thi s,” Margoiin contended.

When questioned about a halter-

how the people are going to get
power. This whole thing (the
Moratorium) is a waste. We
con's ask (or power, can’t ask
for the war to be over, we
must force the war to be overt"
Margolin continued by saying
that what should he considered
by protesters are the tactics
that can be used to make Nixon
stop the war, which Margolin
feels the Moratorium will not

do. He then walked out of the
teach-in.

Next to speak was instructor
'Alan G. Nasser (philosophy),
who to some exiem supported
what Margolin had said. Nasser
spoke of the lack ot physical
opposition to the war by pro-
fessional academics and stu-
dents. Rather, he stated, they
resort to only verbal opposi-
tion which has been discounted
by the nation's administration.
Nasser then discussed other
possible solutions and tactics
to ending the war.

Other speakers at the teach-
in included instructors Stephen
M, Johnson (Poli. Sci.), Henry
F. Klein (Art) and Trio-in-
Residence member David W,
Able.

Shortly after the teach-in, the
members oi the cast tor the
play “The Brig,” pertonned on
the lawn in front of the thea-
ter, For twenty minutes the
lawn was turned into a mock
military training camp com-
plete with soldiers and officers.
The purpose or this demonstra~
tion, according to senior Greg
Wallance, director oi the play,
was to show what life in the
military is like.

During the afternoon, group
discussions with iaculty panels
were held in the lounges at
Main, Loose, Cowles, and Youn<
kers Halls.

Although classes were not
officially cancelled tor Mora»
torium day, at least 118 protes-
sors signed a petition saying
that they would not hold
classes, and classroom activity
was virtually halted Wednes-
day.

.Witnesses Voice Mixed Chicago Reactions

By Alice Rogoﬂ .

Tuesday night in South
Lounge the veterans oi the
latest Chicago action related
the “reality” that they were,
and still are, experiencing
physically, mentally, and emo<
tionally. For a iew days, the
"war had been brought home
to them.” Their former
thoughts and beliefs were
brought face to face with con-
ﬂict, and changed or developed
in the process. They were sur-
rounded by an atmosphere or
dedication and urgency where
words like “revolution" dis—
cussed at midnight become
fangerous realities the mom-
ng after.

Sixteen Grinnellians piled
into three cars and had headed
east to Chicago last week.
Many of them ended up stay-
lug at an SDS movement cen-
ter where the militant Weathers
man laction was staying.
People had been shot Wednes<
day night, and they settled
down in what senior Bruce Nis<
gen described as a “paranoid
atmosphere," They talked with
the Weathermen until six in
the morning.

The general Grinnell reaction
I» the Weathermen's tactics
was negative. Senior Tom
Thomas summarized the Weath-
‘rrnan‘s philosophy as lollowst
’They feel that there is a revos
lutlon going on right now. if
on aren’t fighting for the revo«
ution, then you're fighting
Against it. It’s on eithersot‘
choice. They also believe that
it is important to show that
white people are willing to
fight on the side that non-whites
are usually on. Their purposes
are to raise the level of the
struggle, to build a red army,
and to create an awareness of
the Weatherman‘s presence in

the nation’s mind. They aren't
trying to build a mass move-
ment, but to focus their appeal
to a small select group of
p eople actively willing to
Strike."

Freshman Kay Sophar under-
went the gleatest changes in
attitude toward the Weatheb
merit: "i went there the most
pro and came back the most
anti." After being captured in
a raid, she spent twelve hours
in jail with Weathermen. She
discovered that she was free
only to have the “correct
thoughts.” “The Weathermen
are totally totalitarian — there
is no right to dissent. Try to
discuss and you’re shouted
down." She said. “They’re the
most fascist organization I‘ve
ever come in contact with"

in contrast to the Weather-
men's policies were the tac-
tics oi another group, Revolu-
tionary Youth Movement ll
(RYM II). Senior Sally Hamann
said that “the Panthers, the
Young Lords, and RYM ll all
disliked the Weathermen. The
Weathermen are a white revos
lutionary fighting force with no
concept or serving the needs oi
the people. On Saturday,
RYM iI marched through black
and brown communities shout-
ing 'power to the people’ and
‘the streets‘ belong to the
people'. Their strategy is politi-
cal education, They feel that
not enough people are ready in
their minds to start a revolu-
tion. They are socialists who
want things like a People’s
Medical Clinic,”

Although Chicago police
seemed more restrained ‘than
at the confrontations at the
Democratic Convention 1 a s t
year, several of the Grinnell
participants were critical oi
brutal beatings given to last
week’s protesters by “the

ary Weathermen. And some of
that commitment may have

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Freshman Describes Chicago Arrest

(The iotlowing letter was
written at the request of the
Sim editor.)

To the Editor:

On Thursday. Oct. 9, 1965, I
began my crinriiial lite. On
that day, tho Chicago police ar—
rested me, gave me a ride in
a paddy wagon, sent me to a
Juvenile home, and tor-ced are
to return to Griunell.

Bciore describing my arrest,
I'll explain why I was in Chia
eago. As most students pi‘obnr
bly know by now, 505 called
itor massive anti—war and anti.
Conspiracy trial demonstra—
tions from Oct. 8-11. I drove
to Chicago with 9 other Grin—
ucll students to observe what
would happen and to partici—
pate in what I hoped would be
peacetul demonstration.

We reached Chicago at about
2 o’clock Thursday morning,
and went to the church where
our group had been instructed
to report to by the militant
Weatherman faction oi 5135.
(Although we wanted to‘pani-
cipate in some activities at
RYM-II, the more peaceinl tac—

that tiiiic, a Weatherman asked
for someone with a car to run
an errand One at the Crmncll
students. Chuck Garnian, vol-
untcercd, not thinking that any
harm could result. Another of
our group, whom I will call
Bill, was going to help him iind
his way, and I went along be-
cause I wanted to get out o!
the gym.

We were supposed to bring
ii bullhorn to the wnmen's rally
in Grant Park. and then buy
another bullhorn at a radio
store. Ttie women didn’t want
the bullhorn, but we headed
for the store anyway, 0n the
way to the store, just west at
the Loop, some cops signalled
us to pull over to the side of
the street.

Chuck stopped, and the cops
told him his brakelights were
iaulty, Since chuck was not
ircm Illinois, he had to go to
the station to post bond. At
the station. Chuck and Bill
went inside while I stayed in
the car, One oi the cops start-
ed searching the car and asking
me questions. When he looked
at the windshield visor. he
found a mace pack. and told me
I'd have to go inside.

Chuck told the cop that his
tather, a policeman, had given
him the mace tor protection
when he was hitchhiking, and
he had forgotten it was in the
car. at course. the cop didn’t
believe him; he knew Chuck
had brought the mace to use
against the Chicago pigs. though
he (the cop) never admitted
this. The cop asked me how
old I was; I‘sa‘id 17. He asked
it my parents knew I was in
Chicago; I said no.

Attcr a few minutes, the cop
took us upstairs and began ltll-
log out arrest torms. Chuck was
charged with the traitic viola.
tion and possessing mace (a
deadly weapon); bill was
charged with disorderly con-
duct; and l was arrested as a
runaway. They said it was
standard procedure to arrest
passengers in the car tor dis-
orderly conduct, even though
Bill had been in no way disor—
dcrly. They called me a run—
away bccause I was a minor
iii Chicago without written
parental permission,

During this time, the cops
had found more “goadles” m
the ear and were taking pic.
turcs of cvcrything. When they
found a plastic gun, the cops
were delighted, since they
thought Chuck could be sent to
jail tor possessing it. But they
soon admitted it could he used
tor shooting bubbles. They were
disappointed, I‘m sure.

The juvenile authority soon
came to take 'rnc to his otiice
where he tilled out more forms,
Hi: also lectured me extensive»
ly, and told me to go to school,
their he active in the world. I
think he tinally believed that
I hadn't. come to Chicago to
destroy the city. and we got
along tairly well for a while.
But when he asked me it I had
had any sexual relations with
either of my two companions,
I again decided he was a has-
tard He said, ct course, that
he was only concerned about
the moral implications for inc.
not the icgal implications tor
Chuck and bill.

At about oncthirty, I was
led to a paddy wagon and giv—
en a private ride to the Andy
Juvcnilc lloiuc, about 10 min.
utcs irom the station, oiic oi
the caps that took me there
was interesting, because he
thought it has ridiculous that
a college student was callcd a
runaway, The people who ada
niittcd inc to the Andy home
teit the same way, as did I.

I was admitted to the home;
the social worker called my
mother, who was upset and

gave permission for him to
send me right back to Grin—
nell, instead at to my home
town. Since the next bus to
Iowa lett at 7:30 pm, I had to
stay at the home for about 5
hours.

Atter being admitted, I on-
tercd a room with about 15
other girls. The woman in
charge searched inc, and made
me take a bath and wash my
hair, to ”dc-contaminate" me.
They aim made me wash my
underpants, and gave me a new
pair with the words “Andy
Home” on them. I’m keeping
these underpants as a souvenir.

Until seven o’clock, i sat in
the small room with the other
girls (I was teeling something
like Arlo on the Group
bench), talked, and watched
TV, I wanted to study my
Aeschylus, but we weren't :11-
lowcd to d. Aeschylus is too
dangerous, 1 gucss. Many of the
girls there were runaways
(real ones), and most had been
there before. All were supposed
to go to court, cxccpt inc, The
room I was in was tor short;
term cases waiting ior court.

The longteriu cases (a low
months) were in another part
oi the building.

At seven a policeman and
policewoman took me to the
bus station in a car. I had to
buy my own ticket; ii I hadn’t;
had the money, thcy would
have waited tor money from
home. The cops waited until I
was on the bus back to Grin—
nell. which I reached Friday
morning.

Compared to the other Crin-
nell students arrested, I am the
luckiest, since 1 don’t iace any
fines, and I only have a juver
nile record, which won’t hurt
me later. But the reason I was
arrested, and the charge
against me are appalling. It
irightcns me to know that any.
one con be arrested [or no good
reason. merely because the
cops don't want him where he
is. I was obviously not a true
runaway, yet ttrc law declared
me one. I asked the juvenile
authority what would happen
it my mothcr said it was alright
ioi- me to he in Chicago. He
said they would probably
churgc her with negligence.
Everyone talks about the risks
at our s cicty becoming a
police state. But this should

make it clear that the police
already have more power over
an individual than one's par
ents do. The fact that I was
truly a political prisoner for
a few hours, the tact that I was
torced out of Chicago for no
valid reason. and the tact that
Chuck and Bill were also hr»
rested for ridiculous reasons,
are much more significant for
me than the other occurrences
of that day.

I‘m glad I went to Chicago.
In a few hours, I learned about
Weatherman. about the police,
and about myselt. I would have
liked to have stayed and
learned more.

His basic point was: your

from the students revealed
which issue was more important
kthe one that rated a South

Two further points were that
in the U.S., institutions have 0-

and that it is power. not reason,

These points imply to me that

a valid reason for hiding out in

conclusion that most of the

problem; or that they don’t care
enough to lay their opinions on
the line, Perhaps, it’s tear or

As ior female students, they
are larger in number as a body,

The Oh Squad: Stomp, liompi and Pomp

By Molly McGuire

With banners blazing and bus
gles blaring, to the merry
strains or “Romplng through the
Swamp," Gnnnell’s iralamous
cheering section, the ”0b
Squad,” promises to make an
other appearance at the Home—
comihg game tomorrow.

The Ob Squad, described by
one spokesman as a "dynamic,
throbbing, progressive asocial
group," has made itselr known
at home tootball games both
this year and last, storming
down from the stands 10 lead
the students in all-beat cheers
and songs. Two weeks ago, they
made a road trip to st. Olal,
where they cheered the team to
its first loss.

Based on the principle that
students do want to Cheer and
enjoy themselves at games but
are turned off by the ”same Old
leitnver—lrom-liigh school rah-
rah yells,” the ob Squad hopes
to give {ans a new way to ex~
press their enthusiasm.

Although it has no definite
membership list, the group has
ﬂourished since its meager be-
ginning last yearr Now the gay
participants may number as
many as 75, but as one member
put it, “For the most part, I
think every student on this
campus is a member at least in
spirit.”

Constantly adding to its re-
pertoire, the group has per-

The group is currently em-

0n the St. Olaf roadshow, every-

using, among other things, cym.

Colonel Calls Alumnus' War Report “Treason"

By Mark Graeser

Robert Hodierne, 24, of Gales.
burg, 111., a 1968 Grinnell
graduate, made the news in a
big way recently—for "making
news.” He wrote a story tor
the oiiicial military newspaper
in Asia, the Pacific Stars and
Stripes, which so irked the chief
army spokesman in Vietnam,
Col. James Campbell, that the
colonel accused Hodierne 0i
“irresponsible reporting” that
"does not harder on treason,
it is treason."

Campbell made the charge in
l speech he wrote for an inion
motion officer’s meeting earlier
this month. In his speech he
revealed that because of stories
by Hodiernc and two pulitzer
prize reporters for the
Associated Press, “the Pacific
stars and Stripes has earned
for itself the title of the Hanoi
Herald.”

The day after his speech was
made public, the U.S. Army
announced that Campbell was
being “reassigned” to some
other capacity within the us.
Army headquarters, Vietnam,
in Long Einh. His new assign-
ment was not speciﬁed. Army
officials also declined to reveal
whether Campbell would take
over editorship of the Stars and
Stripes next January as had
been planned before his contro
yersial speech was published.

Hodieme’s story, reprinted in
this week's 5&3, bearing its or-
iginal headline "A Weary Com-
pany Fights On with Rifles,
Grenades. Guts," describes a
“very close, personal. infantry
fight" between the Viet Cong
and members of the Americal

Division in the Hiep Duo Valley.
The story mentions casualties,
tiredness, cowardice, lack of
helicopter support, and the
company pulling back.

Apparently, no one disputes
the facts in the story, par-
ticularly the casualty ﬁgures.
Even Colonel Campbell didn’t
deny that the {acts in the story
were accurate, but said
“whether these ﬁgures are true
is completely beside the point.

“it is my contention that such
Irresponsible reporting is absol-
utely devastating to the morale.
t .of all soldiers. It is also my
contention that such reporting«
in the Stars and Slripes of all
publications‘is of tremendous
aid and comfort to the enemy,”
Campbell said.

In leaiing through the Stars
and Stripes, a daily with a
circulation oi 250 thousand, one
notices a dearth of stories from
the wariront. There are stories
with Saigon datelines, but these
are mostly trom either AF or
UPI. Paradoxlcally, Colonel
Campbell decried the lack of
frontrline reporting, saying:
“With the exception of report-
er Hodieme, the entire staff
apparently considers the battle
zone off limits. . ."

l-lodierne, according to Pro-
fessor Herbert Prescott (Jour-
nalism) who knew him when
he edited the 5&3 in 1965, “H0-
dierne is the kind of reporter
who gets himseli right in the
midst or things, even battle
zones."

A Weary Company Fights On
With Rifles, Grenades, Guts

By Spec. 4 Bob Hodierne

(Reprinted trom the Paciﬁc

Hiep Duc Valley, Vietnam —
The fighting here is a very
close, personal, infantry fight.

The valley is dried terraces,
each terrace three or {our feet
higher or lower than the one
next to it. Around each of
these tiny ,lields are thick
hedgerows. And in the middle
of the hedgerows are ditches

morning sun, a very hot sun,
Eravu had a man killed, a new
guy, and 13 others wounded or
nearly unconscious as a result
of the heat. Heat that some-
times reaches 120 degrees.

Caretuliy they pulled back,
leaving the body of the new
guy, to evacuate their wounded.

By 2 pm the 61 men or
Bravo Cu. were ready to move
back into the same area. No
one really wanted to go. They
just wanted to sit in the shade
and be left alone.

The commander, Capt. Wil-
liam H. Gayler, explained the
situation. There would be no
helicopter gonship support. The
gunships had more important
things to do than support
Bravo Co. Air and artillery
couldn’t be used because the
Marines were too close. They
had no mortars. The infantry-
man, with his riile and gren-
ade, was expected to dig out
the North Vietnamese.

Wearily, Bravo moved for-
ward again — only to be
pinned down almost at once.

Now crawling ahead, the ﬁrst
15 men were cut off from the
rest of the company. Men who
had been tired for days, men
with no water, men who were
really scared, were on their
own.

The man nearest the cut of!
group was told to carry gren»
rides forward to them. He re-
fused, crawled back and asked
the medic tor pills tor his
nerves. While hiding back with
the wounded, the nervous sol-
dier was wounded by 3 M79
grenade round fired by tho
NVA.

While the rest of the com-
pany lay pinned down and help—

less, the point group fought it
out with Charlie. Late in the
alternoon, just as darkness was
coming, the point men man<
aged to escape, crawling a row
meters back to the rest of the
company.

Four more Americans were
dead — their bodies still fur-
ward.

The company threw out tear
gas and looking like monsters
in their gas masks, tried to
advance against the enemy to
recover the bodies. They man-
aged to get just one of them.
Five more NVA were dead and
two captured M60 machine
guns destroyed.

As night fell, the company
straggled back to find a place
to sleep.

Friday morning, more tired
than Thursday morning, but
now only 47 strong, Bravo
knew they would have to go
back in to get the bodies.

“Six Characters in Search of
an Author" will be presented
at 3 pm, tonight and tomorrow
in ARH Auditorium as part of

William Ball’s off-Broadway
revival in 1963 sparked renew-
ed interest in “Six Characters
in Search of an Author," Con-
sidered a classic work from one
of the most influential of the
early voices of modem theatre,
the always witty and sometimes
protound play simultaneously
tells a story and asks what is
meant by theatre.

This weekend’s films are
“The Golden Fish." “Night and

will be shown as a block all

“The Golden Fish" is in
twenty-minute iilm produced by
Jacques costesu and directed
by Edward Sechan, It Won the
Critics International Prize of
the Cannes Film Festival in
1963. The film is an intriguing
fantasy about the affection
between a young boy and his
pet goldfish. An imaginative
musical score and photography
tell the story without narration
or dialogue,

“Night and Fog" is Alain
Resnais’ powerful iilm on the
concentration camp universe.
Granting great force to the
enormity and relentless horror
of the subject matter itself.
Resnais nevertheless manages
to create even greater power
through his remarkable

“Macbeth" was the first film
Orson Welles made after ”Citi-
zen Kane." in 1948, alter
“Citizen Kane" failed at the
box office, Welles undertook a
scandalous enterprise: under
the auspices oi Republic Pic-
tures, a studio devoted to
producing lDWrbudget westerns,
Welles filmed this outrageous
version of ”Macbeth" in s span
of twenty-three days—including
a day of retakest The final
product was an imaginative
and exciting piece of cinema;
however, it bore very little re-
semblance to anything Shake-
speare had ever written with
Welles' own role as a thane be-
ing unintelligible in Scottish
burr. Though “Macbeth" was
Wells' first real disaster at the
box oilice, it has genuine merit
and is well worth seeing if only
to gain further insight into the
greatest ”identity crisis tiitn"
of the year.

President's Statement on Student Decision-Making

' Publish” below are Presl-
iient Glenn Leggelt’s remarks
about involving students In cur-
ricular decision making; he
delivered them at a special
faculty meeting Sept. to. The
president said he delayed pub-
licizing the statement because
he “didn’t want to raise stu-
dents’ expectations before the
facultyi reacted to the proposal."
In response to Leggelt’s state-
ment, the faculty voted last
week to admit four studem re«
porters representing campus
media into its meetings, Illdi to
lorru a joint faculty-student ad
hoe committee to consider
ways-anthueans visavls: 1)
student attendance at. and pos<
llble participation in faculty
meetings; 2) the process of se-
lection and election at student
representatives to faculty standi-
lng and EPC committees; and
a) the relationship between slu-
dent EPC representatives and
divisional EPC committees.)

i want to talk for several
minutes about the ways»and-
means question of student par-
ticipation in determining the
educational policy of the Col-
lege We know there is and has
been for a long time a great
deal of indirect participation.
Students ieam quickly that the
best teachers teach the best
courses, and a successful ca-
reer for any teacher at an in-
stitution such as Grinnell is
very much determined by his
ability to attract and continue
to interest good students His
reputation is created and re-
created with every generation
of students. But what we have
come to mean over the past
few years by student participa-
tion is a more formal thing,
what we might call a struC<
tured device for seeing that
the student voice in college
government is consciously rep
resented. Such a structure.
though imperfect and under
going continued revision, now
exists in many aspects of stu-
dent aiialrs: in matters relat-
ing to student life in the re -
dence halls, in student disch
plinary procedures, in student
publications. and radio, and to
some extent in the scheduling

and management of public
events.

Student participation on divi-
sional EPC committees offers
some promise as a way of elic-
iting suggestions from students
on divisional curricular mitt-
zero, but I think we should con-
sider a more thoroughly devel-
oped structure for represenling
student voice in college wide
educational policy. One reason
is our own mixture of feelings
as a faculty about the degree
of participation we want. All-
other is our difficulty in dis-
covering what degree of par-
ticipation students themselves
actually want. Still another is
that the stnicture of student
government does not appear to
be designed to deal effective
ly with the sophistications of
educational policy determina-
tion. Consciollsly or not, the
structure of student govern-
ment is partially designed to
deal with faculty and admin-
istration as adversaries, not
as colleagues To see the point
i am trying to make we have
only to compare the structure
of faculty governance and its
relationship to the deans, presi-
dent, and trustees with that of
the structure of student gov-
cmment and its relationships
to faculty, deans, and presi-
dent. Over the years the fac~
ulty has developed a structure
to represent its best interests
and obligations in a coopera~
live, constructive deliberative
way; and serious couimnta<
tions between it and the inter-
ests and obligations of the trus-
tees and the president are a
rarity.

Now we need to help the stu.
dents develop a similar struc-
ture for representing their best
interests and obligations. Prag-
matically speaking, such a
structure will reduce the noise
level and let us get on more
calmly and errectlvely with our
teaching and Scholarship. Peda-
gogically speaking, the task of
creating and using such a
structure will give students
part of the education we owe
them; it: will also provide us
with helpful advice and sug-
gestions about educational pole
icy. The problem is where and
how to begin. At one time, I
thought it best to proceed as
we obviously were: adding stu-
dents to faculty and adminis-
trative committees here and
there, trying to settle, at least

tentatively, the question of stu-
dent representation at faculty
meetings; und, all in all, meet-
ing pressures as intelligently
as we could while we were
trying to decide the shape of
the structure that appeared to
be aboming under our feet.
indeed, llntil we came to the
difficult question of student
representation at faculty meet-
ings, I think we had done
rather well. We had met with
some success the problems of
representing students on publi-
cations and radio matters, on
admissions policies, and on stu-
dent affairs. The matters of
EPC representation and judi.
cial council operation still pre.
sent nagging questions, but
they are due mostly to bad
luck and the lack of prece-
deuce.

But in proceeding in this
general pragmatic way. we
have now humped straight into
the problem of student repre-
sentation at facility meetings,
This is not a matter which can
be solved by simple expedi.
encies. it is too fundamental,
and l confess that my instruc-
tions to the Faculty Organiza-
tion Committee to come up
with an answer were prema.
lure. It was asking too much.
As soon as I realized this point
and was driven back to more
basic considerations, 1 began
to think that what might be
desirable is a group which
could be called something like
The Facultysmdent Commis-
sion on Determination of Silk
dent Participation in Educa-
tional Policy, with members
chosen by appropriate means,
and with a mandate to report
by some deadline with recom-
mendations to both faculty and
students. But this device, how-
ever reflned, is not only too
cumbersome; it also assumes
too many things, among them
the notions that matters can
be held at the status quo while
the committee is working and
that agreement on the principle
of how much participation can
be achieved within a reason-
able time.

i think now a middle course
is more advisable and I wish
to propose it to the Faculty
organization Committee for
consideration, in hopes that it
will report its deliberations and
recommendations about the
matter first to the Executive
Council and then through the
Council to the faculty 81 I
whole.

This is my proposal:
That the Faculty Organiza-
Uon Committee meet with the

Student Senate, which includes

'tfent Government, and form all
all boo group to consider the
following:
(1) How the various student
groups involved in curricular
studies, including the student
representatives on EPC Conl-
mittees, might be consoli-
dated into a single, manage-
ablesized group charged with
(A) Developing an election
or selection process for
choosing more effectively
and quickly than now stn~
dent membership on vari-
ous faculty and administra-
tive committees.
(a) Developing a system
for articulation between the
members of the Student
Senate and students serv-
ing on divisional EPU
committees.

'(C) After point B has been
accomplished, developing a
way in which the faculty
EPC chairmen and the stu<
dent EPC representatives
can meet together and de-
cide how best to present
their recommendations to
the F a c \l l t y Executive
Council, When that latter
group is ready to present
its recommendations to the
faculty as a whole, repre-
sentative members of the
Student Senate might be in-
vited to the faculty meet‘
ing to speak to the recom-
mendations.

(2) While engaging in these
deliberations, the Id hoe
group might consider recom-
mending to the faculty at its
next meeting that the faculty
invite to all its regular meet-
ings a representative from
the student newspaper and a
representative from the stu-
dent radio, whose functions
will he repertorlal only.
(That there will be particu-
larly sharp and logical dif-
ferences on this latter recom-
mendation I am aware, and
you are invited as individuals
to send them on to members
of the Faculty organization
Committee. My argument is
simply that faculty meetings
are going to be reported one
way or another, and the pres-
ence of student reporters
might be self correcting and
perhaps give more accurate
results.)

As I see them, the ways-aud-
means assumptions behind this
proposal are:

(i) that the relationship of

(3) that once curricular prov

they should continue to follow
our traditional process: that

(4) that representatives of the

to speak at faculty meetings
in which curricular recom-

(5) that, otherwise, student

meetings will be restricted to
official stlident reporters.

What i've been talking about
are largely ways-andrmeans of
getting more effectively than
we do now student opinion and
perceptions about educational,
policy matters into the stream
of our traditional procedures.
My philosophical biases are
probably apparent. My couvic<
tion remains that ultimately
curricular matters are essen-
tially the obligation and rep
sponsibility oi the faculty nnd

under the delegated authority
of the trustees I am not yet
ready to make any Iundamenial
changes in this conviction. I
am persuaded, however, that
students can bring useful and
proper help to us on education»
all policy matters, provided we
assist them in devising struc.
tures that make such help ef-
fective and constructive.

Call for Power in Administration, Academics, Counseling, Services and Rules

) Senate

Cont. from pg. 1

floor was contacted by meni-
bers of the original committee
to come to a large meeting to
set up committees to begin to
investigate the students' role
in the various areas of decl<
clan-making at the college, and
also to talk to the people on
their floors and encourage them
to participate in the formulas
iion of proposals.

The committees appointed
spokesmen for the senate meet.
ing, and these spokesmen outs
lined some of the basic issues
involved in the students' pres~
out and future role in the col-
lege.

RA SYSTEM CRITICIZED

Senior Mike Penzner, Loose
Hall House President, speaking
for the Committee on counseb
ing, criticized the present coun-
seling system for being incom-
petent and wasteful. He pointed
but that 70 thousand dollars is
spent annually for resident ad.
visors who generally have no
professional qualifications as
counselors. Furthermore, many
students have no contact with‘
their R A’s because the R A's
are either incompetent or phys-
lcaiiy too»far removed, Penz<
ller charged.

Penzner admitted tiiat some
D! the R A's are serving Well,
but asserted that in general
students are getting poor
service for what they are pw-
lng.

He also pointed out that
twelve thousand dollars is be-
ing spent on student advisors
who are usually less competent
than R A's. Perhaps the most
important point of Penzner’o
speech was that the counsel-
lng service was designed by
the administration and the
counselors were chosen by the
administration, and that stu<
dents must have a future voice
in determining counseling pol-
icies. He also emphasized that
resident advisers now play a
dual role as counselors and ad-
ministrators, and this impairs
their function as counselors.
For 82 thousand dollars the

tudents of the college should

ave professional counselors,
eopie who can guarantee com
identiality and cannot be sub.
poenaed by the courts, he said.

. CITES HAWN'S ATTITUDE
' Sophomore Steve Schwom,
assistant Student Coordinator»
gpoke about student social serv-
fces, including BEtG, maids,
bookstore, library, health cen«
gar, Forum and SAGA.
chwartz pointed out that stuo
ent complaints concerning the
1:30 tum. telephone cut-off
'even in mid-conversation)
lnd the present room-cleaning
service have gone unneeded by
Physical Plant Director Dale
Hawn. He also recalled the
work of last year‘s bookstore
committee and the petition that
over 600 students signed re-
garding the deplorable state of
- the bookstore, all apparently to
no avail. Schwartz noted that
the Forum, our student union
bf sorts, is completely run by
Mrs. Jewell Hawk, with stu.
ilents having no say concerning

its budget, policy, or hours.
While committees on SAGA,
the library, building renova~
tion, as well as the Student
Affairs Committee already have
s o m a student representation,
more work needs to be done in
these areas to institutionalize
the student’s decision-making
function, Schwartz maintained.

Sophomore Marshall Barber,
speaking on social regulations,
questioned whether the admin-
istration had any right to dic-
tate rules to students without
meaningful student participa-
tion in the formulation of those
rules. More specifically, Barr
ber observed that the Student
Bill of Rights passed last year
provides protection for stu-
dents, and makes the Mhour
opens policy all the more or.
hitrary and unjustifiable. He
also questioned the administra-
tion’s right to require students
to liVe in dormitories and to
decide who may live off cam-
pus.

Finally, Barber stated that
the college ought to examine
whether it should enforce laws
that are legally the responsi‘
bility of state and local or fed
eral officials. if the college
finds that it must respond to
these laws, students must have
a role in deciding what action
the college will take in these
matters.

CALLS FOR
CURRICULAR VOICE

Senior Jon Royal, after re-
latillg some amusing parables
starring the one and only
Mama Alice (Dean Alice Low).
stated that Student participir
Lion in academic decisions is
minimal and should be expand-
ed. He noted that while in
some departments (notably Po-
litical Science) students had
an equal role in decision-mak-
ing, in general students had
little power in their depart<
ments. There are only two stu-
dents on divisional EPC’s, and
no students participate, in fac<
ulty and trustee approval of
academic innovations. Royal
questioned whether the present
grading system is beneficial, as
well as whether the present re-
quirements were appropriate.
He pointed out that students
should have a voice in the sea
iection of new professors, and
should also have a meaningful
course evaluation system to de-
termine ways to improve the
curriculum and faculty. inter»
disciplinary options might be
created, he said, as well as 8.
12, and ldrcredit independents
when jusﬂﬁed, and students
should also be able to initiate
courses more easily than they
can now. Royal concluded by
saying that the important
thing was to acquire a voice
in the decisions concerning
academia matters rather than
to effect specific changes.

TELLS
ADMINISTRATION’S POWER

Sophomore .ilm Silverman
then presented an effective
understatement 0f the fact that
when one examines the power
of the faculty and administra<
tion, he finds the ultimate and
final power in virtually all as.
pects of campus decisionrmak-

lng. He noted that the admin-
istration or the trustees had
the final say on admissions.
curriculum, requirements for
graduation, and social rules
Silvermun outlined the [l'BnleiF
dous power of the faculty's
Executive Council, which has
no student members. The coun-
cli has oversight of the cur-
riculum, advises the piesident
on faculty appointments and
tenure, building construction
and renovation, and divisional
and departmental organization,
Furthermore, it acts as the
board of review for the com-
mittee on academic standing.
This, Silverman pointed out, is
a far cry from “trial by your
peers.” No students sit on the
Committee on Academic
Standing, or on the Board of
Trustees, and all of these bodies
hold closed meetings.

TRUSTEES UNDEMOCRATIC

The Board of Trustees at
Grinneii is a self-perpetuating
body that fills vacancies and
makes new appointments with-
out any regard for a democratic
process that could involve
alumni, administration. faculty.
and students. The board has
complete financial control of
the College, and has the final
say on the approval of new
faculty, Silverman concluded by
saying that students and faculty
clearly deserve an institutional-
ized role in these administra-
tive bodies.

8 e n l o r Mick Schaalnian
finished the formal speeches by
telling the students that any
move to institutionalize student
power at Grinneil would fail
without strong student support.
He urged students not to be
dissuaded by past failures, and
to get together and work so
that the student body as a
whole can take a proposal to
the administration and the
faculty and demand action.

The meeting was then opened
up to the floor. Sophomore J oko
Mai-golin expressed a pessl~

'nilstlc View, and wondered what
the students would do if they
met stiff opposition. Sophomore
Dave i-lechler quoted some
incomplete but revealing
statistics that he compiled that
indicated that a vast majority
of the Grinneii student popih
lation favored at least an
equal role for students in all
facets of the deCiSanrmaklng
process. Several students called
for a show of strength and unity
when the final proposals are
Submitted to the college.

I personally urge all students
to take part in formulating a
student philosophy and state-
ment of position, one that can
be backed by a majority of
students. For the first time i’ve
seen the possibility of mass
student action to provide the
students with an official role
in college decisions, a role that
can be utilized by the present
and future students of Grinnell
College, '

GDIC FUNDING REQUESTED

In a special 9 o‘clock meeting
Tuesday night the senate
wrapped up its usual business
SD that it Could devote its 9:30
meeting at Roberts Theater to
the question of student power
at Grinnell. The earlier meeting
was held in Burling Basement.
The senate passed a resolution
asking the administration‘ to
fund the Grinnell Draft In-
formation Center ae it is a
counseling service and there-
fore not in the realm of student
government. GDlC needs funds
badly, and the senate felt that
the service was an important
one to the student body.

A referendum was scheduled
for Thursday on the question
of whether the student body
wanted a homecoming queen.

The referendum will effect this
year’s homecoming. A refer»
endum Tuesday was ruled lil-
valid for procedural reasons.

Dean Connie Kimho asked the
senate to formulate a coni-
