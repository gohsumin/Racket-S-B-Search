Pinne Bequeqths $100,000
Collection of Rare Books

A collection or about 0,000
books valued at between $80,000
and $100,000 has been bequeathed
tocrinnell College by Dr, George
F, Pinne, dermatologist, who
died last December at the age oi
as.

The giit, announced by Grinnell ,
College President Glenn Leggett,
consists chieily at a great variety
of first editions in addition tot
volumes with a special emphasis
on history. The rarest item,t
valued at $3,000, is a iirst edition
oi Thomas DeQuincy‘s “Cone
iessions oi an English Opium
Eater.”

Grinnell will receive all the
volumes in the collection except
for the relatively small number
oi medical books which Dr. Pinne
bequeated to the library or the
Univeisity oi Nebraska College
at Medicine at Omaha.

Henry Alden, Grinnell librarian
who iirst became acquainted
with Dr. Pinne and this
remarkable library some live
years ago, says he expects the
collection will not be fully
catalogued betore this tall.
However, he plans an exhibition
at some oi the best items during
the Commencement-Alumni
Reunion Weekend activities here

May 23-31. A group oi the
volumes is to be exhibited at the
Omaha Public Library in May.

Among the rare first editions
are John Locke’s “Essay on
Human Understanding," Adam
Smith’s “The Wealth of Nations,”
Herman Melville’s “Moby Dick,”
Harriet Beecher Stowe’s “Uncle
Tom's Cabin," Henry David
Thoreau's “Walden,”
Nathaniel Hawthorne’s
‘The Scarlet Letter," Walt
Whitman‘s “Leaves oi Grass,“
Victor Hugo's “Hernani,”
Charles Dickens' ”David Cop-
perfield,” and Charles Darwin’s
“Origin of Species,”

The collection also embraces
some “fine press" books, in-
eluding a Kelmseolt Press
“Chaucer,” and three incunabula
(books printed before 1501).
There are a tow manuscript
items, too, one at them being a
postcard on which Queen Victoria
wrote the inscription she wanted
on the tombstone of her devoted
Scottish servant, John Brown.

While the unusally valuable
items in the collection will be
given special care, Alden says,
many oi the books will be readily
available ior regular use by
students.

unusual lecture at this show was
the manual slide change. Mr.
Brown changed the slides to
the music its he saw fit, tene
dering each show unlike any
other.

The music that accompanied
the shows was or iairly uni-
formly good quality, mostly
romantic. The slides them-
selves were of consistently good
quality, every one a prize win»

two was always tasteful. never
inappropriate, and more than
good enough to hold the View

lasted.

The ilrst sequence of slides,
entitled “Flower Fantasy” and
accompanied by Deb uss y 's

of selected locus had insured
that only a small part of each
slitle was sharp, thus creating

lowed the changes in the music
'very closely, making use oi
variations in Color values,

Environmental Teach-[n

This week marks the beginning of the First Na-
tional Environmental Teach—In. All over the country
students, teachers, scientists, politicians, and just
plain citizens are gathering at economic, social, and
academic institutions to focus their attention and the
attention of their nation on the problems presented
by the ecological crisis. There is hope that this
week’s events will be the beginning of a popular
movement that will express in deeds and not merely
words a concern for the safety of our environment.

If this happens, it will not be the first such move-
ment. Among other organizations, the Sierra Club
has for years been actively working on a limited
scale for the preservation of the purity of our wil-
derness areas. The masterful and sensitive photo-
graphs of Ansel Adams and Eliot Porter as pub-
lished in the Sierra Club’s books have convinced
many of the need for active concern in these mat-
ters.

These are days, however, when even such pre-
serves as the Boundary Waters Canoe Area are
threatened by encroaching industry. Pollution of
our environment has, in urban, rural, and wilder-
ness areas, reached a level at which it cannot be
ignored. We are awakening to the need for action
at an alarm which we can only hope did not come
too late. We are no longer willing for our environ-
ment “to be handed over to ceaseless, unthinking
development by those who think only of what it
could yield to them today,” in the words of Garrett
De Bell.

Everyone admits that it is “ceaseless, unthinking
development” that has got us into this situation, but
we disagree as to whatito do about it. Suggestions
for action range on all sides from the active and
rational concern of the conservation organizations to
the rash, if sincere, actions of students who con~
scientiously collect tin cans from the roadsides to
empty on the floors of soft drink and beer distribut-
ors. We suggest that this is a time when, more than

at any other, reason is needed, lest we move from
“ceaseless, unthinking development” to ceaseless,
unthinking activity.

Man, the only rational animal, has often acted
before thinking. If we work together to reverse this
trend, we can more effectively work together to
change our treatment of the environment.

it devolves on me to speak up

Mr. Pepper questions whether

the charge of making its bad-

the faculty tcc. Let us give dis-
credit where discredit is due.

The faculty and the adminis-
tration have preserved, in the
P.E. requirement, the last ves-
tige of a tradiliun that goes back
beyond Flam, even unto Homer:
that man be a speaker of words
and a doer of deeds. My chjec-

The Nature of a Liberal Educaiion

Development-

By H. G. Apostle

pleasures may be intellectual
or ethical (which includes those
01‘ the senses) and they are
present in tile corresponding
activities. those oi the mind alld
those which originate irom
character Since both kinds of
pleasures are desirable for
happiness in thc iullest sense,
both were included in our
definition of a liberal education.
Hence.aneducationwhichleaves
out the discussion of character,
at necessity leaves out any cone
sidcration of the corresponding
habits whose attainment or
possession adds considerably to
one's happiness.

Most college catalogues in
elude the development oi
character as part of the aim of
a liberal education, but a course
requirement on character is
something one hardly mentions,
especially in non~Catholic
colleges. Perhaps there are
reasonsforthis,historicalaswell
as argumentative. Historically,
the desire to aVOld religious per-
secution taught Americans to
respect each other‘s iaith, and
'since ethical values are
somewhat lied up with religion
or are analogues, these too
became somewhat a personal
matter, as long as they did not
conilict with the law, Thus,
theoretically speaking, the
principles oi moral behavior
became personal and “nor-
mative” rather than matters oi
tact and science, though irom the
practical point oi view one's
success tespeciaiiy material
successt depended on some core
at expected behavior.

Moreover, in recent centuries,
thcrc has been a tendency on the
part or various thinkers to coir
sider ethical judgments as
concerned not with matters of
fact but with values, whether
subjective or objective, The \ierv
iiiabiiity in the natural sciences
was visible and relatively easy,
that ill ethics w s eluSive; and
.thc natural sciences had shown
a reinarkablc objectivc progress,
both theoretical and practical,
while ethics and other allied
disciplines seemed to have
stagnatcd with "the same old
pi-oble . So as the prestige oi
the natural sciences was gaining.
that or ethics was relatively
waning In iact, ethics ior maiiy
thinkers was devoid or any
scientific validity. Bertrand
Russell told me in 1937 tllat he
considered morality as nothing
more than a matter oi pcrsonal
wish.

But is morality just a matter
oi personal wish’t II it were, then
approrai and disapproval would
always be a matter oi personal
Wish: and any set of habits would
yield statistically the same
amount oi happiness as any other
set, ,Even the pursuit oi
knowledgc. which is ultimately
a matter oi personal wish, would
hello better than ignorance. For
if one admits that certain 33.
livitics and habits make a man
beitcr or happier. then he has
admitted a statement of fact. but
if he denies the existence of such
a statement. then he dcnlcs a
statistical positive correlation
.and so admits a statistical close

of Charac’rer

to-zcro correlation. But it is a
tact lhﬂl Ul‘ullkarus and
lhicies and murder»
crs and bores and liars
and the irresponsible and thc
unlriendiy and the uiisocial are
not candidates ior happllicss in
the fullest sense: and the harm
tlley cause to others cannot be
denied. for which reasons we
have laws, And ii laws are passed
not lor the sake or promoting
happiness, then ior what other
reason do we have them? That
some laws are bad and can be
improved is admitted; but the
alternative to laws is no laws,
and in general, no laws are worse
than bad laws

Again, those who consider
morality as a personal matter or
devoid of factual content do not
hesitate to make other
statements and periorm acts
which are contrary to their ideas
on morality. Students who regard
morality as personal will have

regarding their cause as more
than just personal. Bertrand
Russell himself did not hesitate
to condemn the United States and
Great Britain and RuSSia for
alleged unjust acts, acts which
he regarded as being objectively
anduniversallybad.

One must admit that ethics is
not so accurate as mathematics,

and it is more complex than

Further, quality cannot be

Quartet Satire. Audience Pariicipa’rion

By Carla Coiiey

Those of you who missed
the concert Friday, April 10th
missed one of the most enjoyable
contemporary concere oi the
year, Billed as “The Quiet
Concert," the hour of clarinet
music was periormed in the
Arena Theatre, which turned out
to be an accoustically flattering
recital hall The periormers
were Paul Zonn, diree at his
clarinet students, Micaei
Humphrey, Sherry Mayrent and
Karen Reese-and baritone soloist
Floyd Slotterback,

The concert began with a
clarinetsolo written by Lehmann
and performed by Mr. Zonn. The
piece, entitled "Mosaik," was an
excellent work with which to
begin the periormance, as it was
one oi the first works to explore
new sounds in clarinet technique;
sounds such as multiple stops and
flutter tonguing. “Mosaik” was
followed by Stravinsky’s “In
Memoriam J F.K,” This serial
work for clarinet trio and
baritone soloist lasted a mere
rninute. Since the pertormers felt
that during rehearsals they had
liked it better each time it was
played, me work was repeated
three times during the evening
with the quality oi periormance
improving with each repetition,

The next work on the program
was a composition entitled
“Screaming Monkeys” by
Stephen Syverud. Since it is often
very difficult to concentrate on
electronic music with nothing on
stage to focus one’s attention
upon, Mr. Zonn passed out
crayons to the members oi the
audience and asked them to draw
their reactions to what they
heard on the back of their
programs, Needless to say, this
proved to be the highlight oi
expressiveness ior the members
of the audience.

The next piece on the program
” tevolutions” was followed by a
Karlins piece “Graphic Mobile."
This composition is of the treest
type oi music. There are no
notes, The periormei-s are given
only ideas and gestures and

shapes, probably much like some
of the ideas which were drawn
out on the back of the programs
during the Syverud piece. This
performance, therefore, was only
one oi a iniinite number oi pen
formances of the same work. In
this case, Mr. Zonn stood on one
side of the stage and three
clarinetists stood on the other.
The contrast between the group
and the solo created what might
be considered a contemporary
concerto effect. Some beautifully
dissonant harmonies came out of
the chance cues to the group,
while Mr. Zonn unified the work
by playing a steady solo line.
The sixth piece on the program
was an old work at Mr, Zunn's,
written in 1956 for Clarinet
Quartet. His style of composition

Student Protesters March to

has changed radically over the
years, but certain characteristics
in his present day compositions
could be recognized in a modified

correlations are not identities.
Nevertheless, the dignity oi a
discipline lies in accuracy as well
as in the importance oi the
subject matter; and what ethics
lacks in accuracy, it makes up
in importance. Moreover, we do
honor or praise certain men in
high positions, not tor what they
have done by accident or in a
matter of minutes or hours, but
for deeds which arise out of
certain qualities, qualities which
are habits acquired through
repeated acts ot detinite types
and stabilized in a predictable
manner. We expect just acts
from a man who has been called
“just", and courageous acts irom
a man who is known to be
courageous. And it such men are
praised or honored tor many
qualities oi this sort, they are
generally considered as leading
a happier life than the rest of
mankind, for, if it is not for a
happier liie, tor what other
reason would they choose to act
as they do or be praised and
honored? ls it because they
benefit mankind? But that is part
of the function of such qualities,
tor, not only do they benefit the
possessor oi them, but also those
to whom the qualitative acts may
be directed, A generous man
gives with pleasure and not with
pain, and the receiver beneiits
by the act of generosity, and
iuriher, the giver is praised or
honored. as if getting a bonus in
addition to his pleasure oi giving;
and such is generally the nature
of an act which proceeds irom
certain habits called “virtues"

Now since happiness is
relatively assured by the posses-
sion oi a number oi virtues, and
since there is a way oi acquiring
virtues, there must be a science
as well as an art leading to the
possession of virtues. The science
of virtues is a matter at
knowledge and of fact, namely,
knowledge or the tact that such
atid such a virtue is acquired in
such and such a manner, and
the art has to do with the specific
acts issuing [l'om such knowledge
and ending in possession oi
the virtues. This art is analogous
to any other art. A student of
medicine first learns the facts of
m8dlClI’lB_ and then he becomes
an intern to get the skill oi acting
effectively in accordance with
that knowledge, and an architect
or engineer- does likewise.
Accordingly, we may sketchily
define ethics as the science of
virtues which lead to happiness,
tollou-ed hy the art oi acquiring
these virtucs Titc science is a
matter of knowledge acquired
through discussion in class. the
art is a matter of acting on the
part oi the student in accordance
with such hnou-ledcc

NAYIONAL RE-
vtrw, wr'tll:
r. too I. as sin-t,
N. r, tom.

Historically, the administrate
tions at colleges in this country
were more particular about the
conduct oi students in earlier
years than in recent years, The
pattern oi conduct was more or
less set, and deviations were
r’eali with in such a manner as
not to disturb the pattern. The
penalty for students, especially
those of academic or some other
excellence, was minor, as long
as the deviation was not too
serious Alter all, there was not
much danger about the pattern
of conduct, and a certain amount
oi wayward initiative on the port
or the student was excused,
sometimes even welcomed. A
successful businessman
preterred a son with zest and
initiative, and pranks were ex-
cused since his son would finally
settle down, and administrations
of colleges understood this
Besides, such a son would not
try to justity his act, he took the
light punishment with slight
rcgrct. The situation now has
changed. We no longer have
isolated acts ot devtation, but
ratiier organized acts; and
further, students who deviate are
determined to do so and to justify
their acts in the name of “social
justice” oi “the new society,” or
“a tree morality" or other such
slogans.

In other words, what is at stake
now is the pattern or conduct
itself or the “establishment";
and it appears that this point is
not quite understood by many ad-
ministrators or trustees, who are
not aware that the problem now
is no longer one of degree, but
one of kind; or else, ads
ministrators or trustees are not
quite equipped, in one way or
another, to deal With the problem
etiectiyely This is to be ex
pected. One who introduces a
great idea or system usually has
reasons for it and can justify it
with arguments. Such were the
fathers at our constitution, whose
justification may be read in the
It‘cdcralisl Papers. Once the
pattern is set and stabilized, that
great idea or system tends to be

perpetuated more by habit and
loss through knowledge oi the

arguments behind it So we

find present administrators less
equipped to defend the pattern
at conduct wtth arguments and
clicctive measures, and this
makes rcbellioiis students more
convinced of'lhe justificalion oi‘
their acts and bolder in their

actions, And naturally, such
students pay more attention to

thc weaknesses of thcir superiors

than to their oivn, young as the
arc. and they are not likely to

raise questions concerning the

weaknesses of their own system
tii they have one at alli, once
such system is introduced But
then, such students see things as
being relatively simple, and this
is because their thinking is
relatively simple.

As for the argument that
students are more honest and
that older men are, more hypo-
critical, even II we admit this is
a tact, and perhaps it is, would
this change human nature by
changing the establishment? For
one thing, older men are more
aware of their weaknesses or
vices than younger men are; and
younger men are more irresponr
sible than older men, It young
men are more honest and more
idealistic, they can afford to be
so, tor. necessity has not yet
knocked at the door. They are
assured of a livelihood and an
education, while older men have
had to provide the means. But
in providing the means one is
faced with competition, and when
there is competition, there we
find the temptation to be less
idealistic and less honest and
more practical. Now these very
idealistic and honest young men.
as experience has shown, do not

hesitate to forget their idealism
and honesty it it is they, and not
their parents, who have to earn
a livelihood and assure their
children a good living and an
education. More honesty and
idealism in younger men, then,
even if admitted as a fact, does
not prevent the change when the
same young men begin to assume
the burden of earning a livelir
hood, whatever the system or
establishment. Evidence of this
is to be seen in a system built
by young and idealistic men the
Sonet Union. Once the system
was built a struggle for power
.and retention oi power ttor
someone must have the power to
do things which have to be done)
resulted in the Stalin era, and
the rest is history. Further
evidence is to be found iii the
very institutions which are
supposed to be idealistic and
which are supposed to promote

Tim claimed that the Senate and

the committee's guidelines be-
cause the Initiative fund is the
only SGA branch oi anything that

other, At Tom Thomas’ sug»

And speaking of Mr, Parssinen,
the Senate won another round in

tions Committee. Andy Brill
asked the Student Coordinator to
run oir an opinion poll to deter-
mine whether the school should
have a yearbook or a literary

that they have too much to do and
that opinion polls might be better
handled through omer channels

These statements are not
unusual or enlightening in
themselves, unless they are
remarkable in coniorming so
exactly to the stereotype of rural
people‘s, but the sincerity,
honesty, and deep feeling with
which the statements were made
unusual. By the end oi the
evening, alter several hours of
talking about everything from
war to religion to drugs, people oi
Mitchellville were convinced of
one thing at least: despite the
clothes the marchers were and
the length oi their hair, they were
“regular folks” 7' and they were
not going to tear down the
church.

A day later the iiiteen arrived
in Des Moines and added their
voices to a large demonstration
in front of Veterans’ Memorial
Auditorium. Many members of
the group ielt that the chanting
and the posters at the demon-
stration made it a success,
serving to ont some people out of
their apathetic or complacent
attitudes, while others felt the
noise had anmgonized people
more can it had opened their
minds. The marchers agreed,

however, that their conversations :

with, thepeople oi Mitchellville
had been extremely worthwhile,
and that such dialogue is
probably more valuable than
even the biggest demonstration.

honesty and juslice and a

mean the colleges and univer
sities ior some proiessors are iust

as weak or ruthless in promoting
their own interests at the expense
at their colleagues, by pei‘r

iorming acts which in llieir
younger days they regarded as
unworthy oi the protession and
even despicable. To quote the
“master oi them that know,"
concerning youth, “Young men
have exalted notions because
they have not yet been humbled
by tile or learned its necessary
limitation, they would rather do
noble deeds than useful ones;
their lives are regulated more by
moral teeting than by. reasoning;
all their mistakes are in the
direction or doing things exe
cessively and vehemently; they
love loo much and hate too much,
and they think they know
everything and are always quite
sure of it, lor which reason they
overdo everything,"

Inshort,. what colleges need
these days ot academic turmoil
is less “personal morality", less
yielding to unreasonable
demands, and more and more

class discussion of ethical issues,
What is the nature of the good,

what is happiness, what is virtue,
what is the aim of life, what is
the aim of education? By
definition, students are in
colleges to learn. Accordingly.
they must submit to learning and
not claim authority to knowledge
and act upon it On the other side,
teachers are in colleges to leach,
and ethics is just as important
as chemistry and literature. A
teacher in ethics should have
arguments for certain kinds of
actions as being pi-eierable to
certain other kinds, and raise
questions on diiticult issues. A
course on ethics should be a
discussion and not it led
ture course. resembling the
discussions in Agora and Plato’s
Academy There will be many
unresolved problems, but the tent
should be set. and an atmosphere
or inquiry and learning should
prevail. and not an atmosphere

difficulties in having such
courses are acknowledged, but a
beginning is better than no
beginningatall.

One theoretical difficulty is due
to the varieties of assumptions
concerning lite, Happiness for an
atheist is limited to this life, but
a believer will-have to define
happiness in terms oi eternity;
and there are differences even
among hclicvers. Nevertheless,
all or them have something in
common: ior example, all agree
on being just, on promoting
the intellectual and social values,
and, in general, on treating in-
dividualsras ends in themselves
rather than as instruments to be
used for one‘s own ends. And if
diiierences exist, pr udices are
more likely to dim ish if the
various assumptions are made
known and discussed, for some
respect and tolerance for dite
ferent assumptions is likely to
follow.

As for physical education and
health, they are well taken care

Faculty Meets To
Debate ‘Betts Motion’

The iaculty met in a special
session on April 16, and in regular
session on April 20, primarily to
discuss the proposal for the
establishment of a committee on
curriculum and academic afe
fairs, the soecalled Belts
proposal. (See the March 18 issue
of the S&B|.

After an extended debate on
technical points, the tacuity
voted to discuss the proposal in
[our parts: the voting mem-
bership, the duties, the respon-
sibilities, and finally the
establishment of the committee.

Another motion was made and
passed concerning student
election to the committee If the
entire proposal is accepted,
Student election will he as
follows: one student elected at
large, and one student elected
from each of the division by the
majors in that division.

The discussion oi the proposal
was tabled until the next
meeting, however it appears that
there Will be considerable debate
before action is finally taken on
the substance oi the proposal.

by approving the
new RE. complex and by
building the academic sched-
me around the spring meets,
it is clear that here is the one
“non-negotiable" demand made
by the administration and the
iaculty. Any attempt by the
advocates of “pupil power".
who have obviously subverted
the sports editor or the 5&3,
to undermine this unalterable
commitment to P.E. will be
regarded by both the adminis-
tration and the faculty as a
“breach of faith". This is not
(to quote Andy Loewx) “a
threat”. Harassment of minor
lties like those of the admin
istration and the faculty will
lead to a solidarity and a
united front which the pupils
have just cause to tear. I need
only point to the uninterrupted
prowess of the faculty as mani-
tested in its athletic victories
over pupil teams in all manner
of good sports.
