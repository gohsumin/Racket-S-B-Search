Revised Court Proposal Approved By Senate;
Next Must Pass Faculty. Student Referendum

By Richard Schnelrov

Wednesday night the Senate
approved a slightly revised ver-
sion of the community court
proposal in a marathon three
hour session. The proposal was
made in the form of a sub-
stitution in the judicial and
legislative sections of the SGA
toy—laws. .

The approved proposal will
be presented to a special fac-
ulty meeting Monday. it ap—
proved, the bylaws will be sub-
mitted to'a student referendum
where a so percent majority
Will he required fer ratification.

In its anal torm the proposal
provides for a judicial court of
three students and three facul~
ty members and a policymak-
iilg committee consisting of
three faculty members and the
Executive Cabinet. The policy
making committee will replace
the present FCSA in function,

The approved change in the
by-laws differed in a number
of areas from the proposal sub
mitted to students February 18.
There were no major revisions,
however. Probably the most im-
portant change was in the form
of an amendment that would
allow senators and hail vice-
presidents to be eligible for
membership in the judicial Coun-
cil. Originally. senators and
vice-presidents were eliminated
lrom consideration.

The Senate approved two ad-
ditional changes, The first one
provided that the appointment
or student representatives to
the court would occur on De-
cember 1 anti May 1 instead
of April 15 as previously stip-
ulated. The second change pro-
vided that the chairman of the
court serve a one semester term
and be allowed to succeed him-
seii. ,

In its final form the proposal
does not enumerate specific
procedures for the court.

Rather, it establishes guide
lines within which the court will
exercise considerable ireedom.

Much of the Senate meeting
was taken up by an inrdepth
discussion of two amendments:
one submitted by Senator David
Swee, and the other by Senator
Roger Koenkerr Swee’s amend-

ment raised an important ques-
tion: What will happen in the
court in the case of a tie vote?
His amendment calling for the
court to submit its case to the
President of the college was
rejected by the Senate on the

Apartments for Women Pending;
Finances Will Influence Decision

By Susan Fogg

Ofﬂoampus apartments for
women will he a reality next
year pending a decision by the
Executive Committee of the
Board of Trustees. According
to Mrs. Alice Low, Dean of
Women, the decision on the
proposal and on the number
of women to be allowed to live
off campus is limited by ﬁnan-
cial considerations, not policy
or philosophy. The difficulty is
whether or not the college budg-
et can afford to lose the board
money in order to relieve uver<
crowding in the quad.

first week alter spring hreeir.
Dean Low feels that the we-
men will bo chosen by lottern
from the names of those ap-
plying if the number of op-
plicants is more than the Board
of Trustees recommends.

The problem of representas
tion of the off-campus women
on the AWS Board came up
at last Monday's board meeo
ing. a twelfth board'membee
was elected by the South cam-
pus dwellers. If the proposal
does not go into effect, onq
of the present board members
will be forced to step down.
Karen Lauterbach has several
tentative plans for handling
this problem it it should arise,
but she ieels optimistic about
the proposai’s chances.

Applications stating a desirq
to move off-campus, and the
reasons for this move, (and
written parental permission it
necessary) are to be addressed
to the Dean of women. Ape

not find an apartment by the
end of the spring semester,
she will then have to pick from
the remaining rooms in the

The Draft —

The government has proposed limitations on student

Let them bear the pain of their crusades. But the morn-

Protest, 30’s Style-

The “Evening of Protest, 1930’s Style" was a rare chance for
the community feeling that can exist at Grinnell to be felt and
expressed. Faculty, students, and administration completely im-
mersed themselves and united in spontaneous fun. The group

that proceded the ”storm” Mr,

Robert Canary’s home afterward

indicated by their excitement the need and the potential for fel-
lowship in a small school. Times like this should happen more

often: they are healthy and exilarating.

A Faculty Opinion

“Community Court"

By John Crossett
(Classical Languages)

Two weeks ago, the editor oi the sail pre-
sented her view on the proposed reform of the
college’s judiciary system, The viewpoint was,
quite naturally and properly, that of the stu«
dents. The proposal, however, presents certain
problems to other parts of the collegiate com-
munity, notably, lthink, to the faculty.

Now one does not expect students to defend
the faculty from dangers; that responsibility is
rightly leii to the tnculiy itself. Perhaps. though,
it is fair to point out that the welfare of the com-
munity as a whole is affected by whatever hap-
pens to he one of its pans, and the faculty is, in
some sense, a legitimate and even important
part of the community.

In the proposed system, there will be two
groups: a Judicial Council and an unnamed com-
mittee on “policy evaluation and recommenda-
tion," The 5&3 editorial struck at the heart of
the committee on policy when it questioned the
commitlee’s membelship: three members from
the administration, three from the faculty, and
three trom the student body.

It seems to me even more
wonhy of comment, however,
to note that the Judicial Council
has no members from the ad-
ministration. Now I submit
that a so-called "Community
Court” which has no member—
ship irom the administration
can scarcely represent the
“community”—to say nothing )r , _
of the fact that other com
stituencies are left out also: M" c"°“°"
trustees, parents, and alumni. In short, the Ju-
dicial Council, made up only of faculty and stu-
dents in equal numbers, is to pass judgment on
students and to sentence them. The president ra-
tains final say over the Council's decisions, but
he has no part in them. Such an arrangement in«
volves the faculty in responsibility Without giv-
ing it any real power, and even worse, it makes
the faculty serve as a “butter" in the constant
struggle between students and administration.

The President of the college is charged, by
the by-laws, with responsibility for the conduct
of students. It is no part of the faculty's duties
to relieve him of this responsibility, either in
part or in whole. The faculty, by its unique posi«
tion, could serve as a liason between the students
and the administration— but it can do so only
if it is not involved in passing judgment. Faculty
members are here primarily to teach the stu-
dents; their only professional right to pass judg-
menl comes in their prolessional competence:
the classroom and its academic concomitants,
such as tests and grades. It would seem that the
5&3 and the SGA should rise up in wraLh at the
very idea of having academic persons pass on
social violations; to accept such a Judicial Coun-
cil is to accept the idea that the academic and
the social are necessarily intertwmed, a position

which, as I understand it, both the Sim and thq
SGA have denied.

As both faculty and students are split on this
question, it would seem sensible first to investi-
gate whether the academic and the social are
bound together. It the parts are separate, then
we do not have a community and hence no right
to a “community court”; if they are linked, then
adequate representation should be given to all
parts of the community, and the community in-
cludes parents and alumni and administration. I
would propose that any “community Court" have
equal representation from all the constituencies
of the community. Such a court — it we agree
that there is a “community“ made up of social
and academic interests — would consist of mem-
bers from the following: trustees; administra-
tion; faculty; students; alumni; parents. Such a
committee, whether numbering three numbers
from each group or fewer, would, of course, be
unwieldy: parents, alumni, and trustees can
scarcely be expected to travel to the college each
time some student chooses to violate a rule and
gets caught. It is clear that a "community
court” which represents all the constituencies
fairly has no manageable meaning; to omit one
or more of the constituencies is to belie its name
and its nature,

My reason tior writing this column is twofold!
first, to initiate argument about the philosophic
foundations of the College; second, to protect my-
self and my colleagues on the faculty from being
used by both the students and the administration
for purposes not natural to us. in the past two
years, major decisions about the social life of
students have twice been presented to the “com-
munity" as if the faculty approved: (1) the res
form of life in the halls on North Campus; (2)‘
the relaxation or abolition of women‘s hours. In
neither case, has the faculty been allowed to
vote, although its opinions have been solicited.
Since the President announced his intention, bath
to faculty and students, to “liberalize” Women's
hours before soliciting the faculty’s opinion, and
wonders whether that opinion could have much‘
meaning I might add here that the SH! seems
to be assuming that women’s hours are to be
done away with entirely; I would suggest to the
editors, and to the students in general, that. noth-
ing in the President’s remarks can be construed
quite so liberally. Failure to appreciate this
point may only lead to more ouerulous Com-
plaints about a “lack of communication”; 1
would argue that there has been no lack of corn-
municalion but rather a lack of intelligent in-
ierpretation.

The proposed reform of the judiciary system
does not state its origin, but one of the agencies
involved is the Faculty Committee on Student All-
fairs. it should be observed that this committee
does not represent the faculty, for it is not a
regular faculty committee. It is instead a presi<
denlial committee and reports directly to him.
In its deliberations and in those of the adminis-
tration, the faculty is no better all than the stu-
dents: it has a belated voice and no vote whatso-
ever. Before students draw any conclusions about
the function or attitude of the faculty in all this
business, they should be aware of these facts.

On the Draft
To the Editor:

it appears as it the nation’s
juvenile propensity for fair-
play in matters which should
more properly be dealt with
on the basis of national secilriv
ty interests has finally overtak-
en our sage executive leader-
ship, One cannot but be some-
what mystified by the logic of
the new system of random in.
sanity, which runs something
to the effect that since we do
not have to draft everybody,
some people are avoiding mili-
tary service altogether by get-
ting educated (shame, shame).

Therefore we ought to do
away with graduate defer-
nlents (and maybe even under-
graduate deterinents) and let

our bright people take their
chances. Never mind that it is
in our interest at least to in»
sure these people that they
will be able to finish their ad
ucations. Never mind that We
can do this more easily and
rationally because the exigen-
cies oi the present world situa-
tion do not force us t/u draft
every one. Fair is fair,

One might go on fulminating
for several hours and pages
against President Johnson’s
balmy draft suggestions; how-
ever, we think that the point
has been made We would like
to conclude by taking note of
two ironies which strike us
most strongly in this, the
winter of our discontent. First,
it seems ironic that college
students, through the doctrin-
rloire application of leitisblib<
eral formulae to problems of
military conscription, have
succccdcd in slitting their own
throats.

Secondly, it seems to be one
or those “supreme ironies" of
history that the elementary
scholars of 1957 — those dlil-
dren who were suddenly ele-
vated to “waveol-lhsrucure"
status by the Russian Sputnik,
and who were to be the im-
mediate beneficiaries of the
new educational revolution a
have in 1967 become the po-
tential victims of a new draft
law which espouse: nnti
tellectuallsm in the interests
or “fair-play," Not satisfied
with levelling most of Viet-
nam, the Administration is out
to level American society It
has said to the colleginns of
this country, “Go away, We
don't need you anymore; the
missile gap is closed.

Mind! to I!"

By David Dillon

in 1958, the Board at Trustees
pledged that all students would
bl admitted to Grinnell on the
basis of character and ability,
regardless oi family income. To
implement this policy, the
Placement and Student Aid Ol-
tice was strengthened, greater
tunds were obtained, while more
leﬁued criteria of distribution
Were developed.

But recent annual tuition
raises pose an even greater
challenge it the college is to
expand its democratic base.
How may we face rising costs,
And maintain a broad social
cross-section in our student
body?

Although other liberal arts
colleges have laced similar fl<
nsncial demands, the need to
provide adequate compensatory
bid is obvious. At present, Grin-
hell is meeting this need. 0p-
fortunity for students from low
ncome backgrounds has ex-
panded. Maintenance at this
capability depends on the con»
(tern of the entire campus com-
munity with long-range goals,
immediate resources, and fu<
tore prospects of the assistance
program.

Written during the adminis<
tretion of former President How
urd Bowen, the comprehensive
fee in 1960-51 was $1,975. Pro-
’ections made that year esti-
mated an increase to $2,475 by
196667, $2,525 by 1967-68, and
52,700 by 1910-71. in fact these
guidelines haveebeen vastly ex-
deeded, as next year's costs
are set at $2,900.

In 1960-81, student aid was
budgeted at $241,400. By this

ear, according to Nicholas D.

yen, Director of Placement and
Student Aid, gift funds admin-
istered by the college amount-
ed to $250,000 in addition, ap-
proximately slooooo was a-
vailable tor longrterm loans,
while campus employment con-
tributed $100,000 more. This col—
lege controlled aid total of
$610,000 is procured from an-
nual operating expenses, endow-
ed and designated grants, and

ovemment loan funds (includ-
rig National Delense Student
Loans - NDSL).

The latter are still a major
component oi the assistance en—
dowment; however, Grinneil’s
NDSL allocation was reduced
about 40 per cent this year.
widened national participation
in NDSL and restricted federal
budgets have forced many
schools to face cuts in these
appropriations.

At the same time, lunds a-
vailable to low-income students
have rapidly mounted. The Rock-
efeller grants to Grinnell, to-
telling $240,000 were specifically
designated for students in mod—
erate or low financial brackets.
They were spread over a seven
year period beginning in 1964.
This $27,000 from the new fed-
ederal E c o n o m i c Opportun-
ity Grants. Undergraduates dem-
onstrating exceptional linanciai
need may be provided with $200
to $800 from government re«
sources, while the college con-
tribute: an equal matching sti-
pend. As future entering alas
ties are brought under this plan,
its value should increase.

Analysis

l Siildelit ii

A similar beneiit will accrue
from Slate of lowa Scholar-
ships, which presently provide
$20,000 at llnancial aid. Thell‘ a-
vailability to incoming resident
freshmen offer further opportun-
ities ior study at Grinnell.

Many Students in the middle
or upper-middle income levels
are taking advantage at a new
U. 5. government sponsored pro-
gram: the guaranteed loan. Ne-
gotiated through a private bank
or lending agency, the loan is
underwritten by a state or non-
prollt agency. The government
pays up to 6 percent interest
while the borrower is in col-
lege, lowering interest to 3 per-
cent alter graduation (ior remi—
lies With incomes under $15,000).
Payments do not begin until nine
months alter completing one’s
education, and may on extended
up to ten years.

Having reviewed existing
channels oi aid, we may ask
what iuture directions assistance
planning should take in the
light oi its basic objectives.
Noting that in 1960, only 12 per
cent of Grinnell students were
(ml-n families with below-aver-
age income, Former President
Howard Bowen stated, “This I
regard as a weakness lrom the
standpoint oi diversity of the
student body. To correct this
weakness we need a substantial
sum each year to be used ex—
clusively to aid outstanding
young men and women from
low-income families. . . Such
students, when caretully select-
ad, would be a splendid scl-
dition to the student body."
The availability oi government
funds and such private donations
as the Rockefeller grants has
tor the time being provided an
adequate response.

But, should National Defense
Students Loans be lurtber re-
stricted, what alternatives could
be pursued? The answer may
lie in “lull-cost pricing”. As
described by Dr. Bowen, full-
cost pricing “would provide, in
street, that lsmiiies pay what
they can reasonably afford tor
the education of their children
up to the limit oi the lull cost,
and that educational subsidies
derived from taxes and philan-
thropy be devoted exclusively
to aiding those students who
cannot afford the lull cost."

In a similar context, Bowen
proposed to “increase substan-
tially the funds tor low-income
students by increasing the prlr
portion of lull paying students
and reducing the proportion of
middle-income brackets who re-
ceive ﬁnancial aid. The money
thus saved could be diverted to
the lowest-income group."

While Bowen considered the
complete adoption or this pro-
posal to be impractical in 1960,
he clearly considered it as A
possible future method to main-
tain on open community. Now
may be a iruitiul time for the
college to review this suggestion.
Many factors must be weighed,
including the chance for foun-
dation backing and the success
oi a similar plan at Banning-
ton.

It may be noted that by 1960.
student fees covered 70.4 pep
cent of full operating costs, as

To Members of the Grinnell
College Academic Community:

For a number of years Grin-

the privileges normally re-
served tor academic depart-
ments. I believe these privileges
should be withdrawn for the
following reasons:

1)Tne Air Force is a govern-
ment agency whose members
are legally bound to carry out
its policies. These policies in»
clude statements about national
detense requirements with their
toreign and domestic political
implications, as particular (high-
ly favorable) View of Air Force
hie, as well as statements of
a moral nature concerning the
political uses or mass, organized
and olten indiscriminate vio«
lence. Reasonable men disagree
about all of these policies, and
siiould recognize the continuing
need for new and creative so-
lutions to a highly precarious
World situation. Yet the content
of Air Force instruction is not
the result of free inquiry by an
individual, but rather is dictated
by the institutional needs of the
Air Force. Should a local Air
Force instructor come to under-
standings dllterent lrom Air
Force policy, he would be my

This is not a new issue and
it is not yet resolved.”

The AFROTC program was
establishhed al Grinnell in 1951,
and until 1954, freshmen were
required to take part in the
program, Although Winters was
unable to say why
originally began the program,
he did suggest that the com<
blnation DI the low birth rate
of the depression years and the
advent of the Korean War re-
sulted in a general shortage oi
college students during the ear—
ly 1950's, 50 Grinnell used the
AFROTC to attract male Stu-
dents. “For many colleges or
this era. the program was a
salvation," he explained

Winters added that the col»
lege annually turns out many
more Peace Corps volunteers
than it does officer candidates.
“We have a Peace Corps repre-
sentative on campus as well as
the AFROTC representatives.
Whatever organizations our stu<
dents are interested in, we try
to bring them here.“

E Hall Secedes from Carleton Women’s League E

By Paul Nachman

Sentiment that student govern-
ment is responsible ior enforc-

nlion has provoked extensive

Inﬂghtiug within the Women's
League (WL) It Carlelon Col~
legs, Northiield, Minnesota —
suits that may have implica-
lions ior Grinnell strident leach
Irs.

According to the weekly
Carletonian, the women stu-
dents are essentially in agree-
ment on the role and responsi-
bilities of their government. But
1 Women's League Council
(comparable to Grinncll’l AWS
Board) decision to deter stu-
dent rule-making until the tall

aroused the women of Evans
Hall, whose members favored

his CRICKETT to be sp

immediate change, to tempo-
rarlly secede ll'om the League.
Since proponents of student
participation in college social
policyamaking face an uphill
hattle against a stubborn Carle-
ton administration. several stu-
dent leaders expressed fear
that Evans' radical move would
only hamper their eiiol'ta {or
change,

Said Carleton Student Asso«
ciatlon President Eric Janus in
a statement for the Carletonian;
"Our goal or student partici-
pation in the determination or
college policy has little support
among those in power. We must
not weaken our position by
clouding the issue. The students
in Evans ought to give their
support and cooperation to a
forthright move by all women

WL President Ann Medinger
said, “The grievance in Evans
is really with Women’s League,
not with administration, on this
occasion."

In mid-February Carleton \vo-
men Voted to redeﬁne WL, our
tontly the collegerule enforcers,
as an organization solely repre-

“This redefinition," explain-
ed Miss Medinger, “resulted
from serious consideration oi
the value of Women’s League’n
role in enlorcing college regu-
lations which it has no say in
making.”

Apparently, no specilic time
was set for the "redefinition"
so Women's League Council
decided to institute the change
next fall.

This decision to deter. action
was not supported by the entire
council. Several members, cons
corned that the college might
institute a paid proctor system
by next tall, urged that the
Council hold A second referem

Weekend
Film

WWW««
By Dale Dreyruss

This weekend, the big, silver
screen brings us Federico Fol-
lmi's La Strada.

This is Fellini’s iourth tllm
(1954). and it has been con-
sidered by some critics, along
with Nights of Cablria, to rap-
resent the apex of development
for both the director and the
Italian neorealist movement.

Using the extremely realis-
tic, otten stark settings and
compositions that were the base
materials {or his earlier ef-
lorls, F. F. also uses protes—
sional, often stylized acting to
achieve a synthesis that reveais
the delicate human emotion of
loneliness as it contrasts to the
bare, unieeling “streets" down
Whlcll we all walk.

he that as it may, the story
concerns the peregrmations of
a simple-minded girl clown and
a poor side show strong-man
who is presently out at work,
The clown without a laugh and
the strongman with only phys-
ical strength are archetypes, i
suppose, but Fellini works them
denly in the context of on
isolated, travelling circus. Like
most or his films, the central
ideas of La Strada are sus-
pended in the mood and at-
mosphel‘e rather then plunging
forth through the action; but
here, at least, the director ls
able to treat his subject Wilh-
out muddling it in the heavy-
hnnded cacophyony oi the sweet
liie. This is Fellini in control,
which is Fellini at his has.

La Strada goes on Friday at

C of HP Election No Mandate

By Steve Shender

In splle of the desolate cries
of despair raised by campus
liberals that the recent CDfHF
election has proved beyond a
doubt the immutably conserva-
tive nature oi North Campus,
there ls much in the Campaign
and the election to suggest
quite the contrary. when one
considers that Theo Le Maire,
a relative unknown, came Wilh-
in 28 votes or heating a for-
mldable opponent who had had
long experience on the West
Norris House Council and myr-
iad contacts with students all
over North Campus, then it at
onoe appears that grounds for
liberal optimism are not unjus-
tified. Last Week’s CanP elec-
tion was not a mandate for
conservatism on North Campus.
Indeed. if anyihing, it evidenced
a nearly even split among the
men o1 North Campus; liberal-
ism on North Campus is any—
thing but a dead horse.

The new COEHP president will
have to take lilis Obvious schism
into account in the coming year.

would risk losing the support
or nearly half or his constie
uents, thus undermining his
position vis-a-vis the adminis—
tration. Nor, even if he sud-
denly became so inclined, would
he be able to tread in Mr, Lo
Maire’s liberal path, for again
he would prejudice his position
in the eyes at the other hail
of his consntuency,

Clearly. the new Coil-1P pres-
ident must carelully tread a
middle path; he must play the
role or a masler politician. This
will be no easy task; it re-
quires a great deal or political
virtue — tact, cunning, ﬂexibil»
lty — a willingness to devote
many hours a week to the tasks
or explaining, negotiating, pla-
cating, and so on. The awesome-

ness oi the task becomes even
more impressive when one cona
slders the Conn> President's
anomalous position between ad<
ministration, students, and other
student leaders, as he operates
within the context oi that po-
litical iniemo called son.

One must hope that the CDin"
presidentrelect will take all
of this into consideration as he
prepares to take olﬁce after
vacation. As for the defeated.
but undaunted Mr. Le Maire,
one can only commend him on

his fervent desire to be of serw
ice to the campus, and hops
that this narrow electoral up<
set will not discourage him
irom continued active partici-
pation in campus affairs.

Arts Program for Grlnn || Children

By Mary Malcolm

Whatever it may lack in competence, Chil-
dren‘s artwork easily compensates tor in natural
humor and boldness, An exhibit of the work of
local children will be open to the public March
15 at 1022 Park Street, new home at Grinnell’s
2-year-old Community Art Association.

According to Mrs Howard Burkle, a “found-
ing mother” of the organization, its primary
activity is art programs (or children, With gen-
eral promotion or the arts as a subsidiary aim.
The art program is experimental, stressing op-
portunites for young children to play freely with
many different kinds of artistic materials, to
“let children play so that they are not afraid of
art,” notesMrs. Burkle.

An oriicial incorporated nonpioiit organiza-
liont the Art Association is run by a board of
town businessmen and teachers, while most oi
the work with children is done by Grinnell col~
lege students. Thus the association is a unique
cooperative eiforl among Grinnell townspeople,
faculty and students, “A liason between college
and town."

Children's lessons are offered in art, guitar,
drama and dance. The classes are broken into
age groups In the younger group [here is very
little tormal instruction but great diversity at
materials The children have worked with clay,
wire sculpture, paints and collages created from
natural objects. At this early stage the intent is
exposure to many art media and to the world
which they represent. For older children the
stress falls slightly more on techniques or imita-
tion, although the attention span and co—ordina-
tion of children have natural limits and the

in Ihe dramatic arts, Karyn Zimmerman
teaches a program of creative dramatics for
children ranging irom 1st to 4th grades. Ana-
lagous to Ihe free use of diﬂerent media in the
visual arts, Miss Zimmerman's goal is [0 make
the children at ease and help them discover
their natural creativity, while adding subtle hints
about gestures and techniques. Miss Zimmerman
worked last session with 14 children of wider age
range with a more conventional approach and
concluded the lessons with a production. Credo

duction. ‘

The emphasis leans toward more formal train-
ing in basic dramatic techniques in junior high
classes, according to Max Helfgotll Heligott, as-
sisted by Dennis Rich, works with 20 Children
and anticipates a production at the end of the
session. Last year the junior high group, taught
by Howard Harned, wrote and produced an or-
iginal melodrama.

The Art Assomation is planning to sponsor a
spring art sale, possibly open air. in late May.
Grmnell students, along with artists from Mar-
shalllown, Newton, and Oskaloosa, will be invited
to show their work, according to Mrs. Burkle.

The Park Street house, acquired by the as-
sociation February 15, is being rented from the
college. Publicity for the children’s art classes
through [he public schools has been requested.
The association anticipates gifts of artwork from
various professional and nonproiessional Grinnell
artisu, among them Messrs. Cervene, Burkle,

Bake Sale This Weekend Will Help Purchase
New Quarters for Southeast Bottoms Project

In an effort to raise a por-
tion of the $6,000 the Des
Molnes Southeast Bottoms Pro
ject needs to purchase new
quarters, Grinnell students are
holding a campus-wide bake
sale today and tomorrow. Pro-
ceeds from the sale will go to-
ward repaying several Iowa
churches which have agreed to
loan the project the money
needed to purchase a private
home to replace their recently
condemned building.

Jim Dunn, a community or.
ganizer and lhe only lull time
staifrmember with the South
east aottoms Protect, described

the area in which the project
works as one where “Nearly
80% of the homes are listed as
either deteriorating or dilapi-
dated; the unemployment rate
is 2.7 times greater than the
city rate; the median education
is 8th grade as compared to a
city median or 12.3 grades;
nearly 80% of the homes have
outhouses and many of the peo-
ple (40 or 50 families) have to
walk In a converted horse drink~
ing trough tor water because
they lack facilities in their
homes.”

The new building will be used
[or administrative tasks and
tund-raising activities, and Will

serve as a meeting house for in-
tormal conterences and special
tutoring. Space will also be pro-
vided for the Still Osteopathic
Hospital and College which fur-
nishes low-cost minimal health

‘Civil Rights Movement Not Dead,’
Delta Ministry Continues Support

By Lilah Morton

Is the Civil Rights Movement
dead? Sue Geiger, representa-
tive of the Delta Ministry Civil
Right movement, who was on
campus this week, doesn’t think
so. According to Miss Geiger.
“the demonstration phase of
civil rights is dying because
Vietnam demonstrations have
taken over. But there is still
a lot of work to be done. In
the immediate future it is the
state elections and, in the long
run, it is education and econom-
ic programs." Mississippi claims
26 of [he 64 civil rights workers
left in the South. in previous
summers, college students [took-
ed to the South to work in the
movement. Last summer there
were only three students, all
or whom were seminarians,
working in Mississippi as part
of their curriculum.

Miss Geiger and her com-
panion, Jean Phillips, discussed
the project with several Grin-
nell students. The discussion
focused on the Federal Food
Stamp program, poverty. dis-
crimination, and the tutoring
program being carried out by
the Delta Ministry. The Delta
Ministry is partially supported
by the World Council of

Churches, which considers Mis-
sissippi as a prime area (or
toreign mission money. Churcha
es in Airica are supporting the
Civil Rights movement in Mls<
sissippi. The result of the dis«
cussion is that Lucy Polerd,
Grinnelt freshman, wants to
volunteer to Work in Mississippi
this summer. Miss Geiger’s re
action was “Great! We need
her and ten more like her.“
Lucy feels that “this is some-
thing ! really want to do. I
like to help people to the best
of my ability. I get a lot of
satisfaction out of it.” Lucy is
concerned with the general
poverty as well as with civil
rights. She worked tor three
weeks in Appalachia helping
clear land for a school.

Immediately after spring va-
cation there will be a fund
raising campaign to send Lucy
to Mississippi tor the summer.
A minimum of $300 will be
needed for transportation, food,
and lodging. Simultaneously, a
campaign for paper, pencils
and crayons will be staged.
These materials are needed in
the tutoring program.

the history of prepping at Grinneli.

With typical 5&8 rhetoric, we editor-
ialized on February 27, 1929: "Prepping
makes an institution more than an edu-
cation factory . t is part oi the sugar
coating on the pi oi wisdom.” This
came hot on the heels of President
Main's plea to do away with hazing.
However tradition dies hard and there
fore prepping didn't —« prepping was
carried on from the first day of school
til the last, with one Hell Week each
semester. However, slight modification
was made in the prep pragramithere
could be no hazing activity for two
hours on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
and Thursday respectively; the tire drill
(preps running a gauniet oi paddles up
and down ﬁre escapes) was discontinued
because it was thought to endanger
various trosh lives with “some plung-
lng down full flights of stairs”; and "at-
tempting to limit destruction to the
campus area.“

By 193061 one house mother threatened
to pack up and leave because of prep«
ping activities and In 1933 prep days
were suspended because the Dean of Wo-
men died.

Prepping Dying Difﬁcult Death

in 1932 the purposes of prepping were
defined as follows: orienting the fresir
men, aiding them in meeting everyday
problems with the proper mental atti-
iude, aiding them in maintaining good
scholastic standing, imbuing them with
the Grinnell spirit, and impressing upon
them respect tor their elders, Or as
the 58.3 so aptly put it: “Kinks In his
character may be ironed out by pre-
sentiitg him to himseli as others see
him." The prepping program at this
point consisted or six branches: upper-
classmen acting as advisors tor iresh-
men, a course in social etiquette based
on the West Point Code, menial duties
(such as giving up beds for visiting alum<
hi and sleeping in the eave troughs),
observance of rules, probation days, and
a formal dinner and initation.

In 193334 a “New Deal” for freshmen
was instituted. Stemming from several
uniurtunate incidents — a stunt per-
formed by freshmen upon which the
5&3 did not elaborate but only Stated,
“Men avoided meeting the eyes of coeds
and snickered sell-consciously" and a
lreshman breaking Into the Quad and
entering rooms alter hours — the er~
gram stressed the status aspect of weara
ing a beanie and paddling was ceased.
Although wearing a beanie was only a
“privilege," there were penalties for not
doing so: first violation, — a warning,
second—withdrawal of social privileges,
third expulsion from one's hall, fuurth~
expulsion tram school.

Grinneii supposedly being the forerun-
ner of educational liberalism west of
the Mississippi, extensive prepping at

women began in 1937-38. The most overt
aspect or this was the Grinnell Stoup‘
on sight of an upperclassman, the
freshman girl dropped her books, bit
the dust in a nifty curtsy while slmul<
taneously putting an orange (required)
bow in her hair.

Again in 194142 a new Grinnellizatlon
program was instituted, based on a point
system —- alter earning 1000 points the
freshman no longer had to wear his
beanie. 75 points could be had for learn-
ing all the school songs, 100 points for
earning a 1.75 g.p.a, and 100 points at
whatever time each freshman had had
at least one date.

From that time on prepping has gone
relatively down hill—calisthenics. mida
night hikes, and a couple at “Good God,
what's the younger generation coming
to" incidents have occurred, but on the
whole, the save troughs havs been un-
inhabited tor quite some time, as stress
is now placed on the socialization of
the freshman to his hall and the college.

kinds for whom I could make
Macbeth little more than a good
murder mystery, but I also
had students who could compose
original .onnets which dericd
Cri Clsn’i. When I was not
teaching, i was granted a taste
of teachers’ typical “extra”
duties.

0n the whole my experience
at this school was highly grnti.
lying and quite “untraumotic'n
The only problem I encountered
was convincing the teachers and
students who patrolled the halls
that l was a teacher. Rarely
could I travel through the halls
without hearing the challenge,
“Hey, kid! Where’s your pass?"

The shift from the ﬁrst school
to the second took me irom
the outer to the inneracity, lrom
a middle class environment to
a lower class one. I ieit a
heterogeneous student body ior
an athegro student body, high-
Calibre teachers for mediocre
ones, an erricient administration
ior a chaotic one, and excited.
cooperative students for ape»
thetic ones. > .

Obviously. my unotiicinl wei-
come to this school could not
be considered typical or Chicago
slum schools. Yet, this school
had its share of other sadly
typical problems.

I had heard that the students
or such schools, like so many
widgets being cranked through
an assembly line, could be autos
matic‘aily promoted (ram grade
to grade and deposited in the
world with diplomas in hand
but very little learning in their
brains. Meeting seniors who
could not identity verbs or write
complete sentences proved it to
be true. Former teachers had
given up trying to tight the
obstacles; the only remaining
aim was. at all costs, to get
the students through the system.

Huge enrollment created sev-
eral major problems at this
school. For one thing, it was
next to impossible for the dd-
ministration or the racuity to
ireep tabs on 4000 students, and
consequently the truancy prob-
lem was staggering. The school
administration had great diiii»
culty in keeping so many stu-

icl‘icoi building, and occasion-
ally gang members entered the
building to intimidate teachers
and students Even students
who had had no actual Con-
tact with the gangs round right-
ing a commonplace I had to
stop one light in my own class-
room and I saw altogether too
many others in and around the
school.

The greatest problem I en—
countered woe student apathy.
Most students had nothing rrom
life so tar and could envision
nothing better in the future
They had little time for learn-
ing, and could not see He
point anyway They were con-
vinced their color had mom
trapped in the ghetto. As one
of my students remarke ' “Why
should I learn to write? I don’t
plan to write another word or-
ter I get out of hero unywny,‘

Already my account oi the

slum school is terribly pessi~
mislic, despite the inn that I
haven’t exhausted the list of
its problems. i want to em-
p‘noslze however that my ex—
perience or this school was every
bit as valuable as that I had
in the outer-city school, pri-
marily because it was the only
school that alerted me to al-
most every obstacle a teacher
can encounter.

In my opinion, practice-teach
ing was the most valuable part
at the ACM Urban Semester pros
gram, because it afforded its
participants the chance to test
themselves in the race of a
variety of teaching conditions.
However, the Urban sociology
and Urban Education lemlnars
which supplemented our teach-
ing experiences were also vul-
uable. as was the experience
or living in Chicago for {our
months.

Then at the appointed hour
both the foolish and the wlse
arose and walked out as 111th

Passing through the halls, they
came to the door that opened
to the classroom. Then there
appeared a certain man anion
them called the teacher. An
lifting up his eyes he distribut-
ed the examination papers.

And when he sat down, some
students wrote for one hour,
and others [or two; and many
and varied were the answers
that were written, for some

some had fallen flat One wise

and in all probability its an<
swer will be worked out by the
court itself.

Roger Koenlter’s amendment
centered on the problem of
jurisdiction. According to the
new byrlaws the judicial Court
has “original jurisdiction in all
cases in which Violations of
college regulations are alleged
to have occurred." Koenker was
concerned that a lot at “small"
cases that could easily be han-
dled by hall councils would now
be handled by the court. His
amendment was later withdrawn
because it passed, it would tend
to undermine the authority oi
the judicial court. Koenker’s
point still stands, however. The
jurisdiction of the court extends
to all cases concerning college
regulationsAaveh such cases as
quiet hours violations or minor
damage.

vide the Air Force with college

tors seemingly equal academic
honors, and to include the com-
missioning oi its ofﬁcers as part
or graduation ceremonies All
or these acts imply that the
college community favors, it it
does not endorse, the Air Force’s
particular conception of how
best to pursue peace.

The extension of favors to the
proponents of one view, whose

the integrity of the college and
its ability to provide an in
tellectual atmosphere in which
all views contend fairly, The
Air Force's View should have

support of an outside institution.

IndiViduals are only likely to
achieve the degree of commit-
ment necessary to preserve a
viewpoint—in the freshness with
which it was originally con—
ceived — if they are torced to
defend that viewpoint from all
others. Such a spirit of inquiry

neither the character oi the in-

criteria for making this deci-

gued that the ArF.R.OrT.C. oi—
ters a commission to Grinnell

otherwise achieve. It is true
that fewer Grinnell students
might become commissioned
officers, although it is also pos-
sible that more students than
now would take the shorter
commissioning programs availa

deniable effect of eliminating

We Win Again!

By Barry Anwna

An inspired Pioneer basket-
ball team hoisted itself out of
solitary’in the Midwest Corie
terenco cellar Friday night by
beating Coe College 75—66.

The victory eased Grinncil in—
to a ninth place tie with the
vulnerable Kohawlrs. The birds
from Cedar Rapids managed to
peck away two victories in the
conference before succumbing
to the Powerful Poweshiek
Pointgetters. Each team now
has two victories to its name.

Tom Hill sparked the Pioneer
effort With a magnificent 21
point showing. Tom’s outside
shots were on target through
But the evening, and his one
tree toss drilled the hoop, El-
liott l-libbs didn't see too much
of the ball, but when he did,
it counted: Elliott hit six for
seven to claim 12 points.

With a 43-32 lead at half-
time, Grinnell entered its usual
second half slump. Coe scored
eight points in a row to cut
the lead to three. It took the
Pioneers ten shaky minutes to
regain their half-time lead.

In addition to Hill and Hibbs,
the starters were Thor Evenson
with 13 points, Mike Schwartz
with 10, and Bob Watt with
1. Roger Able scored 7 points
in service in both halves. Tom
Lower had l and Steve Bn'nt-

SCARLET AND BLACK

Lance, Frohlich _
Dive One-Two

The Grinnell swimming team
took seventh place in the Mid-
west Conference meet at Mount
Vernon last weekend. The Pio<
neer poolmen were led by Rich
Lance and Cliff Frohlich, who
finished one-two in diving.

Other point-getters for Grin-
nell were Ken Adelman, who
took second in the butterfly,
the medley relay team, finishing
fifth, and Steve Holtze and Bill
Batschelet, who placed sixth in
the individual medley and 500<
yard freestyle respectively.

One of the factors hampering
the Pioneer effort was Holtze‘s
illness three days before the
meet. Steve was the team’s top
scoring man, according to Coach
Ray Obermiller, and having him
at less than full strength was
sorely felt.

The freshman swimmers con—
tinue to break records, They
won the conference telegraphic
meet with 72 points, far ahead
of secondplace' Cornell's 42.

Coach Obermiller is looking
forward to next year's Grin-
nell swimming effort: The fresh-
men Will be a welcome ad-
dition to his good. but shallow,
team.

Swimming has been at its
finest throughout the conference
in the past few years. Six re—
cords were broken, and two
others approached to within a
tenth of a second this year,
and two others were broken last
year. Competition next year
should be the best the Midwest
Conference has ever seen.

Finish Season

The freshmen basketball team
dropped its last game of the
season to Cornell, 8514.

The Little Pioneers, coached
by Dick Lovell, spent a good
part of the season on funda-
mentals; only five of the team
members went out for basket-
ball in high school, and of these,
only two started. The lack of
experience was evident in the
Cornell game. but the fresh-
men arc deiinltely on the way
up.

Terry Holloway. the ti'1" frosh
center, shot for a 23.2 point
average as the team went 1—5
for the season. Also in double
figures in season averages were;
Gordy Abel, 14.8; Rad Conner,
13.8: Don Peterson, 10.5.

Soccer, Anyone?

After a successful and spirit-
ed iali season, the Grinnell
Soccer Club is organizing its

from Drake, State College of
lowa, and Knox have indicated
similar plans for spring com-
petition.

an oiilcial conference varsity

nell.

The club will work out 3 times
