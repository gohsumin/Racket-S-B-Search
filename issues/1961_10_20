Dancers Revive

, by Ruth Gruenewald

Over a lunch of yogurt, fruit
salad and baked beans, yester-
day, lndrani and her troupe of
dancers graciously entertained
four Grinnell students, with con~
vcrsation ranging from the
British occupation of Indra to the
educational systems in America
and India and to the bewildering
v iety of languages and dialects

What impressed us most abouti

Although the dance is still
performed as a religious cere-
mony in the temples, it has also
found wide acclaim as a purely
artistic form. “It is too late,"
said lndrani, “to close the gap
between it and religion.”

A noted critic in South India,
K. v. Ramchalldran, paid tribute
saying, “In-
drani’s dance is beautiful because
she Clings to tradition. Her devo—
tion evokes the atmosphere of
the temple where the art was
born and grew.”

The importance of tradition
was brought home to us by a
story that lndrani told. Some
time ago, Arthur Godfrey was
in India and wanted to make a
film of her dancing before a
famous tomb, lndrani refused
request, although he

Ice Cream Social?

Those Who floated home

from the “hall gathering” at

Lake Acre cabin Saturday have undoubtedly recovered by
now i even the lad who received a sobering experience
at the local Community hospital.

Damage to property and injury to bodies was nil,
though this fails to impress those who believe Lady Luck
has a penchant for drunks and fools.

One result of such
Acre cabin and purported

activities

(those held at Lake
beforehand to be a pic—

nic, ski or skating party or whatever) is that all Grinnell-

ians are now held suspect in

their attempts to reserve the

building for truly “dry" functions. And, to go a bit further,
after such as Saturday’s display, one could hardly blame the
administration for refusing to allow students to use the
cabin at all without strict supervision,

But perhaps the real point of the whole thing is this:
Tile incident and every one like it is, unfortunately, a blow
to the argument of those who feel that our present drinking
regulations can, and should be modified.

by John Ward

Yes, Virginia, there is a col.
lege radio station. It's called
lKGRW and its melodious tones
echo once again through the
wires of the heating tunnels,
bringing sound and fury to the
radio sets of a few fans.

The station was started back
in the years when vets were at—
tending Grinnell. They’ decided
that a college station would be
a good thing, so they built one.
Managers came, went on aca-
demic pm. The staff varied be-
tween 20 and 70 people, de‘
pending on the number of egoA
ists on the campus at the time.

The story goes that they even
ran a wire to the railroad
crossing and used the tracks as
an antenna so people could
listen to KG cm the golf course.

Unfortunately, one day a
little black panel truck calme
down the road and out
stepped a man from the Fed-
eral Communications Cominis-
sio‘n,

He said, “Congratulations, you
are coming in loud and clear
in northern Wisconsin." The sta-
tion closed for three years. The
Personal journals of the time
differ on the details.

Nowadays, there seems to be
a problem with regard to a
listening audience. Some pcople
must know that there is a ra-
dio station since the Show schedr
His is well publicized. People
just don’t seem to bother about
listening.

This is sad. The staff at ‘KG
has been cut down to interest-
ed people, about 12 to 15 mem-
bers. These are people who
know music and want to learn
good radio. From 7 to 10 pm.
daily, classlcal and light classi-
cal music is the main fare, This
is good music for studying pcrc
hops, with well-spaced come
mentary on the music and the
music men.

From 10 until midnight the

MUSHCAL
SUPPLlES

menu is a little more varied. It
ranges from jazz to folk music
to rock 'n’ roll, again inter-
spersed with comments on the
music. It is indeed sad that the
listening audience is a minority,
but new habits have to be
learned and slowly the student
body is learning that KG does
exist.

The subject of the existence
of the radio station has
been debated several times,
the most recent occasion be-
ing the san budget meeting
of last year. At that time the
station was off the air. The
question was raised whether
anyone actually cured wheth-
er or not the station was de-
funct.

The answer, of course, is ob—
vious. It makes a big diﬁerence
to the serious people trying to
learn something about the inner
workings of radio, and it makes
a difference to the healthy mi-
nority who listen and enjoy
listening to KG.

The station was oﬁ the air
once this year. The problem
again was cquipmcnt failure.
The basic problem is that there
is no commercially made trans-
mission equipment for the sys-
tem we now use, All of KGRW’s
electronic guts must be hands
built by the students.

The only people available tor
the building of such equipment
are physics majors, who as a
rule are more interested in
atom-splitting than wircAsoldcr-
ing, or else amateur radio for
natics who know as much about
continuous operation broadcast
equipment as i do.

The problem is not insolu-
able, however. i would rec-
ommend that the people in
charge (them must be some
pcoplc in thongs!) investigate
the possibility of the creation

To the Editor:

In this day of Organization
Men, we would like to get into
the act and propose the forma-
tion of a deﬁnitive all-campus
organization.

We must acknowledge our
debt to those perceptive political
scientists, Gilbert and Sullivan,
who ﬁrst observed that “every
child born in this world alive—
is either a little liberal or a
little conservative." We suggest
that most of us are a little of
both and that we ﬁnd much in
man’s history to conserve and
much in man’s condition to lib-
eralize,

Therefore, we propose the
formation of the Conservative»
‘Liberul Club. (We decided on
this listing because: (1) it is
alphabetical, and (2) CL C
sounds better than LC 0 which
might be mistaken for some
sort of landing or launching
croft.)

The 07L 0 will have: no
meetings, no dues, no lmem-
horship lists, no officers and
no mailings, The sole require-
ment for membership is that
tho member decide to answer
lxll inquiries about his politi-
cal olllliotion or position with
the statement, “1 mun con-
servativerlibcral."

Once the faculty and students
are all members and are, there-
‘fore, self-labeled conservative-
liberol, we can foresee certain
economies of timc and effort.

No one will have to waste
time trying to determine the
political complexmn of either
faculty or students. Conserva-
tivc parents will be reassured
by knowing the campus is 100
percent CONSERVATIVE-liber-
a1, and liberal parents can be
happy that the campus is 100
percent conservative-LIBERAL.
People generally, who are con,
corned about the college, can
turn their attention to ﬁner
points such as:

is the faculty competent?

Parsons Reports On

Polish Elections;

Tells Of Color, Campaigns, Candidates

Ed. Note: Bill Parsons spent
the last two semesters as an
“exchange” student in Poland.
This is the ﬁrst of a series of
stories discussing some of his
experiences.

by Bill Parsons
Today is somewhat of a holi—
day here in Poland—today is
election day. All over town are
campaign posters, ﬂags, balloons
and loud speakers reminding
everyone to get out and vote.

The candidates have been active-

ly campaigning now for several
weeks, making public appca -
ances, delivering speeches, vis —
ing factories and forms. it really
seems to be an important thing.

set-up for elections than do the
other countries of the Soviet
block. That is, there are more
candidates on the ballot than
positions to be filled, and the
voter has the privilege of cros-
sing out those he does not favor.
Also, candidates represent 3 var-
iety of parties, and persons with-
out party affiliation can also run.
However, the candidates are
arranged on the ballet in order
of acceptibility by the “United
Front,” a coalition of political
groups under the influence of
the party leaders. Voters are en—
couraged to vote without cancel-
lations, signifying they approve
the program of the ”United
Front” and the candidates plac-
ed at the top of the ballot.
One of my professors is run—
ning for a position in congress.
I would like to see him lose
so he could return to his class
work, but all my friends tell
me that he can’t be beaten.
His name is sixth on the vet-
ing order, and the first seven
nro elected. still, it seems like
very serious business, and prob-
ably about 95 per cent of those
eligible will tnkc port in bring—
ing to power the new regime.
Why is it that such a high per-
centage of voters go to the polls,
if the results are all but pre-
determined? The main reason
seems to be the same which con-
Vinces studcnts to Volunteer for
work brigades. It goes on one’S
record and might cause loss of
certain privileges or even might
make it difficult to get a good
job.

With the unique system of yet-
ing, it is also evident whether
one votes without cancellations,
which is most politically de-
sirable, or if one goes to the ef-
fort of cancelling. Several stu-
dents told me they voted with-
out cancellations just to keep
their record clean, implying that
other action might be noted on
their record. Such are the demo—
cratic, free and secret elections
in Poland of today.

THE FOR UM for DISSENT

by Michael Montross

We are the ﬁrst generation of
a new age and therefore ﬁnd
it hard to condemn the think.
ing of the post as illogical, no.
realistic and out-dated. when it
does not apply to new situar
tions. We live in an age where
it is impossible to use war as
a means to settle conflict or pro»
tect oneself.

Due to the development of
modern science, war is so ad-
Vanced that any country or
small group of intelligent man
can conceivably wipe out all or
any part of the human race.
The slogans, arms control, disA
armament meetings and sum-
mits have become nonsense to-
day.

In any age there exists a lag
between the advanced =discov-
cries and their application. Thus
most men, including of course
the leading politicians, do not
realize that war 15 obsolete and
therefore are wasting the
world’s time and efforts prepar-
ing for the war to end all wars.

There is no defense against
war. ALI talk of deterrents is
insane. The only deterrent to

War is good~will and trust
Khrushchev or Nasser or Ca
tro, unknown to us, could 1301*
Son vnst masses of our popu—
lation, causing unprctlictnblc
tlcctbs and leaving no hint of
where tho United States could
retaliate.

Even if nuclear weapons did
not exist, with the use of chains

RECORQS

icals or bacteria and eithcr a
moderately developed spy sys-
tem or a delivery system of a
few dozen planes or missiles,
the people of any nation can be
brought to their knees.

General Stubbs, chief Chemical
officer of the Army, reported. to
the 86th Congress that as few
as in airplanes ﬂying at very
high altitudes could “get, at
least 30 percent casualties in the
Us.”

Many people, including some
scientists at Grinnell, draw back
in honor at the thought of any-
body stooping so low as to em-
ploy chemical or bacteriological
warfare, as if there were any
death more painful than radia-
tion poisoning. The naive are
blessed, but what are the farm

’The us. Chemical turns on
May 27, 1960, received $103.4
million and has asked for $130
million in 1361. Khrushchev has
said (Feb. 10, 1959 at Sialinlir
gorsk) that “the Soviet Union
will spend from 100 to 125 bil-
lion rublcs in the next seven
years to develop its'chelnical
industry.” He has also said that
in the event of war the Soviet
Union plans to use chemicals,
bacteria and nuclear weapons.

Fifteen percent of the wait -
oils carried by the Soviet
troops in Europe are chemical
weapons (all facts in this fir-
ticlc are from n subcommittee
report of the Committee on
Foreign Relations of the Unit-

TAPES

erl States Senate). Clearly no
country spends (or and devel-
ops an unthinkable weapon.
They develop it because they
could use it.

As concluded by the Fifth
Pugwash Conference on Aug.
10, 1959 with eight countries
scientists attending, the 11.5.
and Russia included, any at—
tempt to control the production
of toxic gases and destructive
bacteria is bound to rail. These
weapons ,can be produced in
an average kitchen, or on a
large scale in any part of the
chemical industry which pro-
vides the es, plastics, explo-
sives, mcdi nes, bleaches and
other ingredients necessary to'
modern life,

People of the world, unite 7
throw off the shackles of tradi—
tional thought. There is no de-
tense, the world is too small,
the weapons too large and im-
possible to control. Tho human
race must rethink, and not re—
act, if we want to survive.

Let each man refuse to kill.
so that he will not in turn be
killed. This is the only solution,
difficult and improbable as it
is, All any man can do is
change himself and hope othcrs
will realize the new truth in
time. We live only by the good—
will of our neighbors in this
world, Only ignorance and lock
of desire by tho informed pre-
vent ally group or country from
killing or blackmailing any oth-
er group or country.

Amendment Causes
Debate In Senate

After many long and weary
minutes of debate, the Senate
passed an amendment to Article
1, Section 02 of the Student
Government Association consti~
tution Wednesday night.

The amendment, which is con—
cerned with the election of
women senators. is as follows:
“The representatives or the
women's residence halls shall be
elected no later than the third
Monday- and no earlier than the
second Monday after the start
of classes in the fall. The exact
date of election shall be set by
the Executive Cabinet.” ,

After passage of an amend-
ment by the Senate, it must
be ratiﬁed by (in per cent of
the student body and then ap-
proved by the president of the
college and by the faculty be-
fore it can become part of the
consumtion.

The bitter debate which pre-
ceded the amendments passage
was set off not so much by the
amendment itself as by the
question of just when and how
amendments shall be presentedl
to the student body for ratiﬁca<
tion. While suggestions were
made, no steps were taken at
this meeting.

Other important motions passed
by the Senate included the re—
affirmation of most of the leg»
islation passed between Sept. 1
and Sept. 30, a motion taking

ed through a window in the door. The new "Village" is pr
viding complete laundry and cleaning service to the public.
The coin—operated dryclcaning unit will clean anything from
a man‘s suit to a formal evening dress. Eight separate ma-

Gridders Will Host Buccaneersi

Pass defense will be the order
of the week as the Grinnell Pio—
neers prepare to meet aerial—
minded Beloit here on Ward
Field at 1:30 tomorrow afternoon.

For each club it will be the
fifth Midwest Conference game,
with the Grinnellians resting in
second place with a 3—1 mark
and Beloit in a tie for eighth
with a 1-3 record.

Although the Bucs have won
only one game, they have one
of the best passing attacks in the
loop, led by allsConference quai»
terback Jim Kupllc,

“After what happened last
week, and recalling what he
(Kuplic) did to us last year, we
should be more than ready to
work on pass defense this week,"
Coach Edd Bowers sai .

Last week One hit on three
straight long passes in the last
minute of the first half to
score. And again, late in the
game, the Kohawks used
passes to puu them into posi-
tion for the three-point field
goal which clinched their was
victory.

Last year Kuplic. with his
club down 23-0 ,began firing the
long pass, pulling the Bucs back
into the game. only to see Grine
nell hang on and win 29%, .,

Coach Bowers also said he
planned to work more on the
Pioneers’ upsandrcomlng passing,
attack this week, in the last two
outings for the Grinnellians,
quarterbacks Art Peterson and
Dick Orchard have been hitting
ends Gene Kowert and Fred
Arnold with regularity.

So far this season. Orchard is
the leader, finding the target 11
times in 24 tries for 150 yards.
Peterson has hit on s of 19 air
tempts for 112 yards. 1n half as
many games, these two pitchers
have compiled only 45 fewer
yards than Grinnell gained pass-
ing all last year.

The ground attack, led by
John Hartung and Ryd Waller-
stedt, still provides Bowers l
with his main offensive threat,
The two have rambled for a

total of 614 yards in the four
games, with nartung holding a
344-270 edge over the fleet’
Wallerstedt. t

Though the Coe game was ai

tough contest, the Pioneers came
out in good physical shape and
should be at their physical peak
for Beloit.

Coach Bowers is expected tot
start the same offensive outfitl
against Beloit that he did last
week againet Coe, including:
ends Kowert and Arnold, tackles
Arlan Danne and Dennis Asby,
guards Dick Harris and John,
Hentzel, center Kirk Van Rooy-
an, and backs Art Peterson,
Carlton Peterson. Wallerstedt
and Hartung.

Saturday, defeating St. Olaf 4—1.
in avenging last year‘s setback

Grinnell scoring leaders were

When Grinnell regained pos-

tained by a well-clicking aerial

Kohawks moved the pigskin

nell 30 yard line, when Post con-

nected on a pass that netted a
first down on the Pioneer sixA
teen.

After another first down at
the four yard line, the Scarlet
line tightened and allowed only
three yards on three plays, With

The previously unbeaten Grin-
nell Pioneers suffered their first
defeat of the season at the hands

before a crowd of 2000 at Cedar
Rapids, Saturday. The heavy,
powerful Kohawks line and the
spotty defensive play of the Pier
neer backfield were key factors
in the loss.

Out to make a good showing
on their Parents Day, the Coe
gridders came through in the
clutch, scoring all their points
with less than 30 seconds to go
in each half. The loss dropped
Grinnell into a second place tie
with St. Olaf in the Midwest
Conference standings, while Core
nell secured sole possession of
the top spot by swamping Bee
loit 25-7,

Coe took the opening kickoff
and began a drive which netted
four quick first downs before the
Grinnell line stiffened on a

, The Pioneer fans who made the trip to Coe last_ week
lwel‘e shown a perfect example of the actions of an imma-
tlll'e college community. As the Grinnell rockers lined up on
ltlle field to welcome their team bitch onto the gridiron at the
islal‘l. of the second half, a large portion of the Coe students
lstormed out of their seats, across the field and forced the
Pioneers back onto the track next to the stands, They then
jeered and hollered to drown out the cheers of the Pioneer
cheerleaders.

Let us hope that we at Grinnell will continue to treat
the opposing teams and their rooting sections with the re—
‘spect that good sportsmanship demands.

Positions Are Open
On Campus Courts

Applications are now being ac-
cepted for openings on the High
Court. According to Bill l-lalama,
SGA president, two positions,
those vacated by Tonia Kolosky‘
and Lee Weisel will have to
be filled. The terms of both Miss
Kolosky and Weisel come to an
end this month, according to
tenure of office for the High}
Court as set up in the new SGA
constitution,

Those wishing to apply should
submit written statements to the
Executive Cabinet stating theii
background qualifications and
reasons for wanting the pop
Deadline for applications is
Thursday. The Executive Cabinet
will then make its appointments,
which will be subject to Senate
approval on November 1. Appli-
cants must have at least second
semester sophomore standing.

The duties of the High Court
are two—fold. First, it acts as an
appelate court. Any student or
group of students who has been
fined by a Primary Court may
appeal the decision to the High
Court. Such cases are open or
closed as the defendant wishes,
and the decision of the 'High
Court is final (unless the student
takes the case to the administra—
tion). .

A decision must always be
made first by the Primary

Court. The High Court has

original jurisdiction only when

a member of the Primary

Court has been involved in _a
misdemeanor.

The other duty of the High
Court is to serve as an interprer
ter of the SGA constitution. The
Court has the right to veto as
unconstitutional any act of legis—
lation passed by the Senate.
Such cases are open to the pub—
lic' and, in case of a Court veto,
the law becomes null and void;
there is no appeal.

Arguments, both pro and con.
are presented at an opening
hearing. The verdict is made
public and each justice’s vote
is stated, Maiority and disent-
ing opinions are also written
and are presented to the Scarlet
and Black for publication.

Two positions on both the
men’s and women's Primary
Courts are now open, accord
ing to Calm president Ray
Horton and Aws Board presi-
dent Jill Dennington.

Term of oifice for the four
positions is one year. Applir
cants, who must have at least
second semester sophomore
standing, should file their
names and qualifications on
or before Thursday with Hor-
ton or Miss Dennington

The result would be a radio
