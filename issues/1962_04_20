failed, he said to recognize that

. A Tribute

Actualizing’ a new, l'al' from perfect constitution is
no easy task. inevitably the bulk ol' the burden fell upon

the shoulders of Bill Halanla and Cameron llendersliot.

With the help of tlle other Executive Cabinet members
the two managed to get the new macllille running, despite

l‘v‘lechanical confusion and constitutional vagueness

Early in the first year smooth operation was at times
inhibited by tile open rift between the Student Body

President and the Speaker of the Senate, Over time the
personality and poLicy gap closed and effective coopera-
tion followed.

While Hendershot helped to fulfill the new governr
.cJent’s need for constitutional and procedural self-dis-
cipline, Halahla provided the equally important demand
for spontaneity and flexibility.

Agreement between the two was strong- regarding the
proper role of student government. Both held that stu-
dents ought to concern themselves with crucial public is-
sues ol' the day. Not only did this policy confront the
campus with major social issues, but it also minimized the
tendency of campus government to consume itself on
“domestic” trivia.

The new SGA President and Speaker have much to
live up to. Both Halama and Hendershot have demon-
strated remarkable political courage. At times each has
taken unpopular stands and faced the consequences. The
lndny hours both gave testifies to the fact that each took
his responsibilities seriously. Both have often worked
twenty-five to thirty ho'urs a week to adequately meet
their obligations.

It the new leaders assume their responsibilities with
the same degree of commitment as the Halama-Hender-
shot team and show the same strength of conviction, SGA
should accomplish much iii its second year.

Our Code Too

In July of 1961, a code of ethics of the student press
was recommended by the 10th International Student Press
Conference in Rome. The Scarlet and Black subscribes to
that code which is reprinted below:

“This International Student Press Conference, believ—

ing that all student publications throughout the world
should respect the basic principles of human rights and
that they should maintain good quality workmanship and
a. high standa'd of conduct, recommends the following
Code 01' Ethics for observance by student journalists:
Tile student journalist should strive continuously to
be unbiased and accurate in his reports and should
equip himself adequately with facts to support his
published statements. He should fully realize his pe -
sollal responsibility for everything he submits for
publication.
The student journalist should reveal his identity as
a representat 'e of the student press bet‘ore obtailr
ing’any interview for publication.
The editor should not exclude a student point of
view solely because it is contrary to the editorial
policy,
The editor should apolo 'ze in print at the first
available opportunity for all mistakes.
A strident journalist should defend freedom through
the honest collection and publication of news and
facts and through the right of fair comment and
criticism.
A student journalist should respect all confidences
regarding sources of information aild private docu-
ments. He should not falsify information of docur
nlents or distort or 'misrepresent the facts.
Student journalists should be familiar with the laws
01' libel and contempt of court which e ist ill their
country and should observe the international copy-
right agreement—unless this interferes witll the
freedom of the press or the need to inform the pub,
lic on vital matters. Every effort should be made
to retain the independence of all student publications
from public relations, censorship, pressure or undue
influence from any outside body, political, govern-
mental, religious organizations or universities

Juslice Holmes did not mean
that circumstances alone created

rather that words could hclp

his statement in Schenk v. the
United States: “The question in
every case is whether the words
used are used in such circum-

danger that they will bring

Huber, Brown report on Principia peace talks

Says Uniteol Sial’es must maicll
Soviets' ideological appeals

by Phil Brown

Henry A. Kissinger states the
lollewing in his book “Nuclear
Weapons and Foreign Policy":
“Foreign policy has its exprcs~
sion in the judgment oi iacts 7
the judgment that we exercise in
discriminating among them.”
One of the central topics oi de-
bate at the Pi-iiicipia College
Public Aiiairs Conierence was.
the relevance oi moral analys
and judgments to the issues in-
volved in nuclear politics.

Seville Davis, Chiei Editorial
Writer ior The Christian Science
Monitor. said the common con.
iusion between a moral or ctliis
cal view oi politics and a view
based on political and economic
consideration leads to emotion.
alism and a distortion oi the true
picture oi a world engaged in a
deadly battle oi power politics.

An example oi this is the
built—in deception or the dis.
armament probleiu The masses
oi people in the United States
not only desire disarmament, but
have internalized their wish and
pushed it into the rcalm oi the
conscience. By considering (llSr
armament as a moral issue or
ethical stand, one transiorms
what what is in reality a politir
cal judgment into a moral posir
tion and. in a larger sense, an
expression oi opinion toward the
behavior of the Soviet Union.

The person who conceives oi
the politics and power oi the
nuclear age in terms oi the
abuses oi love and compassion
is headed toward a philosophy
oi appeasement which is in-
consistent with the preserva—

tion oi our democratic society.

Davis envisions the moral
problem or iorclgn policy as cenr
tering around, the positive and
negative aspects oi strength and
powc- The moral basis ior dis-
criniinating in the right use oi
power and the best means to our
end must be that lirmness and
decency are compatible,

The two opposing questions
which appear to rise out oi this
general stand are (1) How can a
hmit be placed on the degree oi
iirmness which the U. S. will use
in preserving itseii as a iree and
independent country? and (2)
How can the possibility oi nu.
clear. war and the annihilation oi
millions oi people (let alone the
destruction or organized civiliza-
tion) ever be conceived oi as be.
ing “decent?“

The approaches oi the con~
ierees at Principia to these dues.
tion spanned the iull range oi
moral and political judgments.
“The primary objective oi the
United States is preserving the
American way oi hic, ii neces-
sary, at the expensc or peace."
This was the morals-subordinat—
ed answer oi one commission.
Other individuals, however, held

ship of newly elected Speaker
Terry Parssiiien, the student
senate adopted some amendr
ments to the women’s house
rules (pages 47—52 in the 1961-
62 student handbook). The rule
changes were sponsored by Jill
Dennington, retiring AWS board
president. As amended, the first
paragraph oi article HI section
A reads as follow,

“The loggia and Mcars doors
are locked at 10:30 pm. Sun-
day through Thursday nights
The lights in the loggia will be
blinked ﬁve minutes beiore it
is locked and a warning bell
rung three minutes lbeiore clos—
ing hours, The lights will be
blinked at lelin i-iall entrance
by the night check girl rive and
two minutes beiore iinal closing
hours, which will be determined
by the Main Hall clock, Lack
oi the time trainings will not
be considered a legal excuse ior
lateness.” The last sentence was
added because it was pointed
out that the time signals are
only a convenience and might
not be exactly on time, or on
rare occasions might be entirely
omitted.

Article in section A—Z.a. has
been rewritten to provide a
change in lateness penalties.
“Main hall entrance will be
locked at midnight
through Friday and at 12:30
am. Sunday (Saturday night).
Any woman arriving aitcr the

considered late, The normal

hall. Men leaving the Quad—
rangle through the Main Hall
entrance aiter the loggia and
Mom doors have been locked
will incur the regular lateness
penalty ior their dates."

This change was contested
by the representative from
James on the ground that since
the library closes at 11:30 and
women's hours are 12 put, any
violation would be ior social
reasons, thus no distinction
should be made in determination
or penalties. in answer, Jill Delia
nington pointed out that more
violations occur on weekends
Some discontent was voiced
over the provision that a wom-
an could be subject to a penalty
causcd, not by herscli, but by
her dates tardiness in leaving.

Latencss penalties tor ii-csh—
man women in article H1 section
A.2,c. were revised to read as
ioliows. “Closing hours ior

“To the degree the Russians

also on its willingness to use that

Kissinger said that “what lit

“The democratic forms which

Speaking in coniunction with

is a means. not an end to his-
torical development in Africa.
There wlll soon be 31 indepen—

out, and the problem of divers—
ity in African cultures has
arisen.

The question today, he said, is:

added.

er simple, the Yankees being evcl'ybody’s favorite to 1‘

Detroit, Baltimore and Chicago will battle it out Ti

I pick the Minnesota Twins. They have always had a n
clcus for it fine team, but nothing to add to it. Th
season they may get extra help they sorely need. o

The National League, on the other hand, will pro
to be a more interesting group to watch, because of 1
expected tight race.

Although four or five teams may have 21 chance f

the title, most of the puller in the league is centered a
