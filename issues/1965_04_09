lagging Economy. Unemployment
Fosters Discrimination: Haveman

By Don Winney

“A buoyant economy de-
creases discrimination. Con-
versely, a lagging economy en~
courages discrimination,” This
is the economic hypothesis
Robert Haveman (economics)
presented Tuesday night at the
third in a series of dimers deal»
ing with the race situation,

“Economic discrimination,“
he sald, “does not deal With the
maltreatment of one individual
by another, but with the mal-
treatment of a society to a
group in that society. In the
United States We do have eco-
nomic discrimination, and the
degree is substantiali"

Haveman defined economic
discrimination as being in in-
come, job opportunities, and
education, He pointed Out that
the income of Negro workers
is ﬁt) per cent that of white
workers. In occupation, 14 per
cent of white employees are
in professional managerial po
sitions; only 2 per cent of Ne-
gro employees are. Lack of ed-
ucational opportunity is a basic
cause.

Supporting his hypothesis,
Haveman cited recent ecomonic
history. “At: the onset of World
War II," he said. ”all labor was
pushed into production. Ne-
groes were hired for jobs they,
had never held before; Negroes:
acquired skills they had never
had before. There was a move-
ment of Negroes from the red-
cap and service areas of the
economy to the production
line." Economic necessity thus
decreased discrimination.

“But the last decade," he:
continued, “has not been good‘
for the Negro. The economy
has lagged. The Negro work
force has been laid off first,

and Negro unemployment is
twice as high as Whites. Much
of the sluggishness in the past
is due to a labor force ill-
equipped to handle the jobs
open. Racial discrimination is
a large reason for this."

In our market economy, he
explained, labor must be able
to react quickly to changes in
price and demand. But discrim-
ination blocks this reaction
and prevents a mobile labor
force from being utilized to ex—
panel the economy Because the
quality of labor is dependent
on education, discrimination in
education limits an economy’s
productive potential. Haveman
Called this mutual negative at-
traction between a slow econ-
omy and discrimination “the

ﬂrinnell House Open;
Board Assigned Halls

The members of the new AWS
Board were assigned to the halls
in which they will serve as presla
dents.

The presidents and their halls
are as follows: Mears, Jenny Har-
lordi Main, Laurie I-loudek; Cleve-
land, Ellen Pearce; James, Joan
Lovejoy; Halnes, Delabian Rice;
Read, Ruthie Koehler; Loose, Jane
Betts; Park Street houses, Dottie
Dosse: Grinnell House, Janet
Francis.

It was also announced that
Grinnell House will be used as a
women‘s dormitory next year.
This necessitated an additional
member of the AWS Board. Jenny
Harford was named to fill that
position this week.

Men's Housing
Decision Later

The decision on whether there
will be offrcampus housing for
men students next year will not
be made until the end of April,
Dean of Men 5. Eugene Thomp~
son said this week.

“We know the off-campus
houses are a good deal, but they
are designed for an overflow. In
addition, the college has a con-
tinuing commitment tor the rest
dence hall system," Thompson
continued

“Every male will draw for a
room on north campus in mid-
April and then may get a chance
to apply for off»campus housing
at the end of the month,” he said.

When questioned about the off-
campus situation for women,
Thompson said there will be wom-
en off campus next year in antici-
pation of a new women's dormi-
tory.

Acting President James Stauss
said that no commitment to build
a new women’s dorm has been
made, He added, however, that he
expects Grinnell's enrollment to
increase to about 1300 in the next
several years

In another area, Thompson re
vealed that a new policy allows
work orders for damage on north
campus to be reviewed by the
CofHP and the dean of men so
that responsibility for the dam-
age can be reassigned when
necessary.

Two-Way Locks

Locks to be installed on south
campus doors will be able to
be locked from both the inside
and the outside and will be of
the deadbolt variety, Vice
President Merritt Ludwig stated
Wednesday.

 

Grinnell Room Fulfills Need for College Archives

By Sue Johnson

The need for college archives
became evrdent when James Nor—
man Hall, coauthor of Mutiny on

the Bounty. left to the college all
his papers. letters and manu-
scripts. Opened in 1959 as part of
Burllng Library, Grinnell Room
now fulfills this purpose. The col-
lactinn includes all the college pub-
licatlons: catalogs, President’s re-
ports, student publications and mm
grams. Careful searching and cat-
aloging also reveals books of col-
lege and town history, publlca
tions by and about faculty and
alumni, papers on independent
study projects and dozens of other
fascinaiing items.

Rare and unusual photographs
further tempt the interested re-
searcher. Pictures of former dra-
matic productions show amazing

 

ingenuity in the creation of sets

designed for the limitations of
ARH theater. From 1904 are pic-
tures of the science laboratory and
the Women‘s gym class, both caus-
ing amusement to the modern
viewer. Newspaper clippings and
various student accounts supple-
ment photographs of the 1882 cy-
clone and tell a story which words
alone never could.

Grinnell Room also houses two
fifteenthcentury publications, one
by Thomas Aquinas; a portrait
collection from Civil War times;
an 1812 land grant: a l7l5 ship’s
invoice; an original copy of the
Articles of Confederation; clippings
about Gary Cooper; Prominent
Among the Mourners, a mystery
story about Grinnell; and infor-
mation about the Grinnell family.

A fireproof vault guards some
of Grinliell Room's treasures: the
Hall manuscripts. records of liter-

 

ary and debate societies, faculty
reports, and correspondence from
the 1800's. The publications from
the fifteenth through the seven-
teenth centuries also have a place
in this Section,

The furnishings add further in-
terest to the room. A huge solid
mahogany table is the principal
item of furniture; the Bauhaus
chairs were designed by Marcel
Breuer. Any program being pre
sented in the Viewing Room can
be picked up by a remote control
speaker located in the dropped
ceiling of Grinnell Room. Located
in the floor under a plaque is a
box containing memorabilia and
information about Burling Library.
This was dedicated during Com-
mencement Week in 1958, and is
intended to be opened in 2058.

Students are urged to contribute.

Micro—Musings

There was a lot that could have been editorialized
about this week There was the search for a new college
president, the Viet Nam situation, men's off-campus
housing, the psychological services offered at Grinnell,
the meaning of Easter, proctors, the new student govern-
ment, the U. S. space program, the proposed new wo-
men’s dormitory, the faculty tenure system at Grinnell,
civil rights, the 1965-66 school calendar, and Waldo
Walker’s retirement from the administration.

It was an interesting mingling of topics —- local,
national-world, and universal. It seemed like a good
time to create some new terms, so we named these three
editorial topics micro-problems, macro-issues, and
mega-concerns, respectively. After creating these
names, it seemed appropriate to editorialize about these
various topics, thereby concerning ourselves with even
another topic, which we won’t bother to name here,

To get started, it should be pointed out dust the
5&3 has at times been accused of not liberating its
readers’ minds from parochial affairs (micro-prob-
lems). Our defense is that our rambling on macro—issues
or mega~concerns would be an unimaginative extension
of the academic method of second-hand research com-
plemented by often- useless insights

The concern of the S&B is with first- hand gath-
ering of facts on Grinnell 5 current micro problems and
presentation of our research and of our consequent pro-
posals. This type of editorlal should have mole mean-
ing for both the reader and the writer.

The 3&3 will continue to present a broader View
of the macro-world than is manifested in Grinncll,
Iowa. This view is certainly more dramatic, Our Selma
issue is an indication at our desire to present macro-
and mega-viewpoints.

But we think that our editoiial opinion is most
constructively ielt' in the world of Grinnell micro- prob—
lems Editolializing is among the few practical efforts
that can be made in our micro- -world dedicated to mega»
concepts of macro- maybe.

Meenng LcRoi Jones should be like meeting your
conscience in a dark alley: you should expect knives
entering your Spirit and soul-blmd spilled and
smeared in your brain. You picture a smug self
satisfied superhipsler oozing hate with his every
syllable. It’s all a pleasant letdown to confront the
soft. spoken but articulate angry young man on his
own terrltory.

I bumped into Jones as I Walked out of a movie
theater in New York; he was on his way in a con-
ference wilh some ABC bigwigs. Efficient and
businesslike despite his Greenwich Village garb he
scribbled his address and told me to get in touch
with him.

When I finally found my way to his East Village
home overlooking the scenic Bowery, l approached
with some trepidation — an Iowa college kid about
to meet the very controversial Mr. Jones. Expecting
to be dazzled by the sun god himself, 1 knocked,
waited and entered as Jones motioned with it free
hand, holding the other to a telephoned ear.

This is LeRm Jones, author <7! The Toilet, The
Dutchmln, The Dead Lecturer and a number of
other works including a book on jazz and a partially
finished twentyvvnhlme suicide note. Amazing. This
is LeRoi Jones, anathema to white liberals and
conservatives alike, voice of an impatient Negro
population, member of the school of hip young
artists who are changing the temper oi the Amer-
ican cultural scene.

I had heard about his weekly sessions at the
Village Vanguard with his White Liberal Stampers
and I had read a personal statement of his in some
avanbgarde magazine and 1 was not prepared for

the amiable, good humored person with whom I
found myself shaking hands.

“Where is Grinnell? What's it like?” he asked as
I introduced myself and the tellow students with
me. Lacking the time and the energy to answer
his question with the care and accuracy them it
demanded, I gave him the college catalog treat-
ment and dismissed it. Maybe he wasn't satisfied.

I asked him the questions that have crept mm
almost everyone’s mind alter seeing or reading
his work —- “Do you mean it?" And emphatically,
“Yes!" was my answer. His own personal theories
of the theatre demanded the blood bath — and
besides, What Negro in America doesn't mean it?

His show The Toilet, has closed in California be-
cause of charges of obscenity or something else
some authority iigure saw fit to call objectionable.
Jones smiled and said it would open again.

The Dutchman and The Toilet have upset. offended,
and challenged more whites than Howard Taubman
and Walter Keir, the New York drama divinitles,
could ever have imagined. They are the hard-hit-
ling expressions exploring a new perspective in die
anger of the American Negro. Both are staged dis-
sections of the oppressed and offended minority in-
dividual, baring the seething passions that in»
escapahle intercultural conﬂict elicit. Both are what
has been needed for some time.

As We left he showed us some of his Ian mail,
a letter from a what could only have been a former
white liberal suggesting that Jones flush himself
down his own toilet. It occurred to me that what
the suggestion itself needed was a lime more of
that Toilet paper because it was obviously encrusted
with three hundred years worth of shit!

Coed Reports from Morgan State

Institute for Political Education

To the Editor:

Many Grinnellians are un-
aware ol the unique institute
tor Political Education at Mor»
gan State College in Baltimo e,
Maryland, where I am a v' t-
ing scholar {mm Grinnell this
year.

The Institute for Political
Education attempts to interest
the Morgan campus, which is
predominantly Negro, and the
community in practical politics.
Twenty Institute scholars, in-
cluding tour oi us visiting from
other schools, participate intenr
slvely in the program for one
year. All of us receive Ford
Foundation scholarships.

in our regular workshops
lasting two hours every Tues-
day afternoon we discuss topa
ics ranging from political boss»
ism to national elections, and
always devote some time to the
perennial question “What has
happened of political signifir
cance since last We met?” In-
dividual assignments take one
hour each week and often conr
sist oi clipping newspapers, In
addition, We have been to
Washington and Annapolis (the
capital of Maryland), lectured
at public schools, worked dur~
iiig the election, and helped plan
other Institute programs.

Campus activities oi the lnsti-
tute Lhis year have included a
mock Presidential election, a
presidential election prediction
contest, a political birthday
party for
voting age in 1965, and speak
or: including Nicholas Katzenr
back, Carl Rowan, and the two
Senatorial candidates in the
last election from Maryland.

The Morgan community,

cause about 2/3 of the approxi-
mately 3,000 students commute,
is hetereogeneous, Morgan stu-
dents are often older than Grin-
nell students, Many of them
have been in the service, or
have worked before coming to
college. They come from vari-
ous socio-eoonomic classes, and
many of them come from over
seas.

Race, as at Grinnell recently
(according to the many letters
and articles in the SEKB de-
voted to it), is often a topic of
conversation, popping up in

classes. in the canteen, in the ‘

dorms, virtually any time or
place, Sometimes the question
seem to be belabored all nau-
seuni (“If only . , ."), but a
problem Can’t be solved by ior-
getting about it, and this prob-
lem certainly can’t be forgotten
at a predominantly Negro col-
lege.

lite at LeMoyne Gets Comment
From Grinnell Exchange Students

By Mike Fort and
Jim Stephens

As exchange students at Lee
Moyna this semester, we‘re of
course interested in the war
for civil rights, seemingly be-
ing waged both in Selma and
in the 5&3. We, like everyone
else, believe we have all an-
swers to the problems at hand
and wish to ofier our services.

The “cook’s tour” offered by
our associate didn’t seem to
quench any insatiable‘scholar-
ly curiosities, so we decided to
pick up where the cook’s tour
left off.

To see LeMoyne in 6% min-
utes is just that: to see Le-
Moyne and not understand any-
thing about the oollege. it is
possible to see Memphis in
three hours or to see the en—
tire breadth of the United
States in 10 hours.

way to the South, and a lead-
er in the civil rights struggle
for the entire Mid-South areal

LeMoyne is located in a
neighborhood which has, in
years past, known violence as
its only law. Across the street
in front of the school is a gov»
ernment housing project which
replaced the poverty of an
earlier slum. Directly behind
the school is a poverty stricken
housing area which is being
considered for Improvement by
the housing authority. In this
setting, LeMoyne represents
the torch of hope for many
students in a world in which a
college education is becoming
a requirement for any person.
The majority of LeMoynltes
are struggling upward against
their impoverished way of life

Ask a LeMoyne student why
he is here and he will reply
that he could not afford to go
anywhere else. Ask him why he
did not go to Memphis State.
a large state university which
was recently integrated and
which is less expensive, and he
will say that LeMoyne is a
better school, which is true,
The LeMoyne faculty is young,
dedicated, and burning with
the desire to help all their stu-
dents find opportunities for ad-
vancement and success.

Campus Individualism Seen as
Negative Rather than Positive

To the Editori

Recent events would seem to
declare a sweeping victory for
the cause of “individualism” on
the Grinnell campus. In €87
sense, this philosophy seems
to state that we are each unique
individuals with unique inter-
ests and needs. Since this is so,
the most desirable atmosphere
for campus living is one which
allows each to pursue his own
interests and satisfy his desires

in the manner which best suits‘

his personality, providing, of
course, in doing so he does not
interfere with the rights of oth-
ers.

There are several elements
in this philosophy which are
deeply disturbing. In adopting
such a philosophy, it would
seem that in reality what is oc-
curring is an abdication of the
responsibility of concern for
one’s fellow student.

I do not believe that an indi-
vidual’s concern for the well-
being of another individual will
disappearl Rather, it would
seem that we are denying any
collective concern or responsi-
bilit for the well-being of an
individual as a member of a
common community Grinnell
individualism seems to be noth-
ing more than ego-centrism un»
der an acceptable name.

This all seems rather ironic
when it is placed in the con-
text in the recent racial cris-
is in Selma, in which all have
declared their common con-
cern for the rights and well-
being of individuals far re-
moved from our community,
and from our daily lives

The second element which
disturbs me is the theme of
“individual freedom” which is
implicit in this new philosophy.

 

This theme could certainly not
be called a new one. However,
Grinnell, as usual, has given
a different slant to it. We seem
to be constantly demanding a
kind of freedom which is “free-
dom from" - freedom from
rules and restrictions, freedom
from demands, freedom from
responsibility.

My conception of true free-
dom, that which cannot be de-
nied, must be “freedom to”
and must be accompanied by
a high degree of personal re-
sponsihility.

Thus it would seem to me
that the philosophy of “indi-
vidualism" at Grinnell is essen-
tially negative rather man pos-
itive

This is not the Grinnell to
which I came as a freshman
Were I a prospective fresh»
man now, I am not sure I would
come.

Dicken Expliculesv
Viet Nam Situation

To the Editor:

It is instructive to note how
the roots of American policy
in Viet Nam lie deep in the
pathological period of Ameri—
can antircommunist hysteria
and of Jvhn Foster Dulles’
"brinksmanship" loreign pol-
icy. Several of the characterise
tie approaches of the Johnson
administration to the war in
Viet Nam may be found in the
United States' response to the
lndo-China crisis in 1954 and
immediately following the con-
clusion of the armistice nego»
tiatiorls in Geneva in July. 1954.

The domino theory of mar
munist expansion was current
at the time in its familiar role
as a justification for preupi-
tste action undertaken with mi-
nor regard for the principles of
international law and of the
United Nations charter. What
amounted to “aggression" was
detected, too, in forms exceed»
ingly resistant to documentae
tion: the French officially de-
nied that assistance from Chi-
na played a signiﬁcant part in
the victories of the Viet Minh.
The impending fall of Dienbien-
phu evoked a number of deSr
perate proposals from impor-
tant members of Eisenhower’s
administration, one of the most
reprehensible of which was the
proposal that Dienbienphu be
ringed with “baby Arbombs."

Optimism about the future of
French colonialism in the area
was not lacking, Two months
before the fall of Dienbienphu.
Admiral Radiotd, Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was
declaring "The French are g0-
mg to win this war," in addi-
tion, predictably, to character-
izing the war as a fight against
“Communist aggression."

The Geneva Armistice. con-
cluded in July, 1954, soon alter

bienphu split Viet Nam rough-
ly along the 17th parallel, rec—

Diem as Premier. Diem left
the seclusion of a Belgian Cath-

post. Diem recommended him-
self highly as a man who could
be relied upon to resist the
commitment to hold elections
in 1956. He did not prove a dis-
appointment on that score.
in refusing to sign the Ge-
neva Agreement, the United
States opened for itself the pos-
sibility of taking up the situa-
tion Where the French left Off.
The position could only be at
tractive to those who had not
learned the lessons of the
French defeat: that as a pre—

Pioneers Hope For Strong Season
As Veteran Team Awaits Opener

Coach John Ptltsch is relatively
optimistic this year about the var-
sity baseball team with much of
lest year‘s team back and a cou-
ple good sophomores and a trans-
ier coming in to till some gaps. He
feels that every position on the
team this year is stronger than
last year except possibly pitching,
which is at least as good.

Ptttsch is Confident the hitting
will improve to cover up the very
weak spot of last year’s team. The
top two hitters, Nick Nonas and

Dick Ulrich, are back to lead the
way. Pfitsch is hoping that sev-
eral players, like John Shierholz,
Dave Synhorst, and Barry Ander-
son. who showed signs of becom-
ing good hitters last year, will de-
velop this year. Phtseh also likes
the idea of having three left-
handed hitters in the lineup, which
he will have this year. These are

ﬁeld.

The pitching should be Strong
this year if the three top hurlers
can recover from pre-season in-
juries that have limited their prac-
tice. Dennis Hanssen and Barry
Anderson are the top two pitchers
for the Pioneers, Anderson seems
ready to go, although a shoulder
injury could slow him down. Han-
ssen, who injured his knee in in—
tramural basketball, should be
ready about next weekend. Steve
Tilly, who also plays shortstop, is
the third pitcher but has been un—
der orthodontic care and has prac-

(iced very little. Dave Schatz, the
left-handed outfielder, was drafted

 

for the pitching corps in case the
top three can not perform,

One of last year's defensive
weaknesses should he improved,
The Pioneers have two strong
catchers, a ﬁrst baseman, and two
outfielders at least as good as
last year's counterparts, while the
rest of the team is returning.

are potentially the best teams in
the southern division of the Mid-

Now that spring has hopefully come to the Grinnell cam-
pus, it is time to turn our thoughts to the outdoor sports—
tennis, golf, track, and baseball. After a somewhat disappoint-
ing winter season, the Pioneers seem ready to tear the Mid-
west Conference apart with veteran teams returning in all
s orts.

D Major disappointments were seen in all the winter sports.
At Darby the thin grappling corps was hurt by several in-
juries—the most harmful of all to captain Larry Miller who
had to give up his chance to become a three-year conference
champion. Also in Darby, where the hoopsters were suffering
through what must be called a rebuilding year, the Pioneers
saw a record number of points swish through the basket but
unfortunately nearly a record number of losses were regis-
tered on the scoreboard. ’

Also over at the swimming pool the fans sweated out the
meets in two waysimentally as they watched the mermen
battle for a victory, and physically as they sat in this steam
house But the fans temporarily forgot these adverse coir
ditions as they saw anchor man Tony Horton paddle his way
to an apparent Victory over Cornell in the last race to give the
Pioneers an undefeated season—only to find out a couple min-
utes later that the Pioneer team was disqualified and Cornell
snatched away the perfect season.

But now the winter season can be forgotten as we look
towards the promising spring season. First of all the track
team looks ready to place high in the conference with the
indoor championship already under its belt,

The baseball team had only a 4-7 conference record
last year but two of the top three pitchers and the top three
hitters are returning to show they should not be regarded light-
ly this year.

The tennis team had a fair 5-4 record last year but the
whole squad is returning so the netmen are definitely in the
running for the conference crown. The golfers are also of
championship calibre. The linksnlen have their two top men
and several others back from the team that had an excellent
7-1 record,

Of course, having key lettermen back does not assure
a profitable season~but it sure is a good start. The Pioneers
are definitely due to break out and take a couple champion-
ships and this looks like a ripe time to do its
