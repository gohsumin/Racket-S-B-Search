Leggett's statement says that
the tmstees are “concerned,

all areas or the college, an»

and charitable gifts, a depress-

tionary trends.

Complete Text of President’s
Letter on Financial Problem

To: The Faculty Fromi Glenn Leggett

At their meeting last week in Des Moines the Executive Com-
mittee of the Trustees asked the deans and me to make the follow-
ing kind of statement to the faculty:

The Trustees are proud of the academic reputation of Grinnell
and know that the scholarly promises and accomplishments of its
students are a direct reflection of the competence and energy of
a superior ieculty. The Trustees are committed to maintaining
such a faculty and they realize that such a commitment involves
a steady improvement of faculty salaries, of research funds and
facilities, of Sabbatical leave arrangements, and other “fringe"
benefits. The Trustees are aware that the general physical and
emotional environment in which faculty work and live is crucial
to recruiting and keeping a productiva faculty.

At the same time, the Trustees wish the faculty to be especial-
ly cognizant that the immediate future poses the same great
financial problems for Grinnell as it does for all institutions
of higher education. Costs in salaries and Wages, in financial
aids ior students, in construction and remodeling, in Stu-
dent aud administrative services are rising much more rapidly
than revenues. A depressed market, anxiety about the outcome
of proposed tax legislation affecting foundations and charitable
gilts, and yet the continuing general inflationary trend all con-
tribute and will probably continue to contribute to the increasing
difference between projected income and projected expenditures.

The Trustees are concerned, not alarmed. The endowment
portfolio or the college has been steadily increasing in value over
the past few years, and it IS quite probable, assuming the same
rate of growth, that at some time in the future earnings riot-n en-
dowment will play a greater share than they do now in helping
to bring projected income and expenditures closer together. At
this moment, however, and in the near future, earnings from en-
dowment do not provide sufficient funds to ease substantially the
amount of gifts required each year to balance the operating bud—
get. The giti requirements each year. accordingly, have steadily
increased; and, though the college has been more successiul than
almost any of its competitors in securing gifts, the gap between
required and realized gift income is increasing too iast.

Accordingly, the Trustees wish to request the faculty to give
careful consideration to the following possible ways of alleviating
the financial problem:

(1) Increasing the faculty-student ratio by a reduction
in tacuity numbers.

(2) increasing enrollment without increasing the num-
ber of faculty.

(3) Increasing the proportion of fund! which student-

Rally Call for Student Power

"Every student on this cam-
pus needs at determining role
in making college decisions,"
student senator Bill Thomas
told some 200 students at a
rally In front of the Forum last
Friday (Octr 3).

"Committees w i t h student
representatives don’t deal with
the basic, central decisions
that affect the college, but with
the smaller petty things,"
Thomas asserted. “Students
have to get together, with the
goal of more student decision-
making power.

“Nothing is going to be done
it the majority of students al-
low only the activists and radi-
£215 to take action,” he con-
tinued, “The need for unity is
paramount."

The rally was originally cali<
ed to discuss Dean Alice Low’s
re-definition oi the resident ad—
viser role in the college drug
olicy. However, because Dean

ow rescinded the policy sev-
eral hours before the rally,
speakers shiited the focus of
their remarks to the matter of
the students’ role in college do-
clsion-malring.

“Grinnell students are sati5<
tied, orderly, docile, happy,
and conventional," Instructor
Alan G. Nasser (Philosophy)
told the crowd.

“There is a myth on the East
Coast that Grinnell College is
full of students who are social-
ly aware and politically con-
scious," Nasser said, “but this
place isn’t anything lilre its
reputation tor being alive and
Vital.

“It is possible for students

to be aware of their powerless-
ness, but you people are not
aware." N a s s e r continued.
“Students here seem to acqui-
esce in the tact that they have
no power to participate in the
decisions that affect them.”
Nasser also said that tradi—
tlonaily the faculty has wielded
the greatest power at Grinnell.
“It's my perception that they
set policy,” he commented.
“You should get together and
make a formal decision as to
whether or not you want to par-
ticipate in the power structure
here,” Nasser told the students.

"I would hope that a Con»
sciotts group would emerge
from the student body and
start talking, conferring, and
acting on the basis at reflection
on matters such as these,"
Nasser Concluded.

Senior Tom Thomas told the
crowd that students are pres-
ently involved in “a tokenistic
system of decision-making.” He
urged students to organize and
exert pressure on faculty and
administration for equal stu-
dent representation in decision-
making.

“You must let them know
that you don’t recognize the
present decision-making proc—
ess as valid," he said.

Junior student senator Bill
stranger told those at the
rally that "Grinnell College in-
stitutionalizes adolescence.”

“when we come to Grinneil
we have a new set of parents

confronted the faculty at a
meeting late Thursday after-
noon, and was met by a mod-
erate declaration of support.
“The college supports it," said
Prof. John Worley (Phil.), sec-
retary oi the taculty, atter the
meeting, “but will not impose
It on the college community.”
The Moratorium motion, which
was approved by the fac-
ulty “overwhelmingly,” guaran
tees that no penalties will be
imposed on protessors for not
teaching classes, or on stu-
dents for not attending them
on Oct. 15. The support or the
Moratorium did not include a
comprehensive policy statement
by the faculty, however, and
such a policy statement did not
come up for general debate.

“This is a declaration of both
support and freedom,” Worley
added. “There is an option tor
the student and the professor
to take part in anything or his
own choice.”

Jltoélmatc ﬂoat

By Henry Schetf

Now that my weekly report
from the student senate is a
column, the editor informs me
that I may editorialize occa-
sionally if i deem it appropri<
ate to do so. However, I do
feel that I owe the readers 01'
this paper a factual report of
what the senate is doing. I will
try to keep the distinction be-
tween fact and opinion as clear
as possibler

The most interesting occur-
rence at Tuesday's meeting
was a move by Grinneli Wom-
en’s Lib ion to eliminate
the institution of the Homecom-
Ing Queen. Sally l-lamann told
the Senate that the idea behind
the Homecoming Queen is in-
suiting and degrading to wom<
en. She pointed out that the
queen is judged by how she
looks, not what kind of woman
she is. The woman is viewed
as an object rather than as a
person. Furthermore, nomina-
tions are made only by males,
and the queen usually ends up
n Caucasian because of our
culture's artificial standard of
what. is beautiiul.

She pointed out that the land-
slide victory of Dick "The
Kid" Meliman for Homecoming
Queen last year is an indica-
tion that the students do not
want a Homecoming Queen.
However, there was some feel-
Ing expressed by some students
at the meeting that The Kid
was elected as a jag end that
a majority or students might
want a Homecoming Queen.
After 45 minutes of debate and
discussion, the Senate officially
recommended to the Student
Affairs Committee and Presi-
dent Leggett sbolishment or the
institution of Ho rn e c om in g
Queen at Grinneli College. A
reterendum on this question
Will be held later this semester.

The Senate approved student
representatives on the Library

and Admissions committees,
and also approved sophomore
Jon Stein as the new Social
Coordinator, to fill the vacancy
created by senior Lee Sham-
berg's resignation.

Senator Bill Thomas asked
the senate to approve a mo-
tion calling for telephone votes
to approve remaining commit-
tee positions as fast as pos-
sible. This motion passed, the
senate realizing that these
committees should have been
ﬁlled sooner.

Student coordinator Frank
Thomas brought to the Senate
a proposal by Dean Connie
Kimbro dealing with “the park-
ing ploblem” on campus. It
called for the registration ot
all cars with the Deans, who
would issue parking stickers to
authorized students, according
to the motor vehicle rules
stated in the Student Handbook.
illegal parking would be the
able, with the Physical Plant
issuing tines unless the senate
wanted to take over this func<
tion and appoint student en-
forcers. A number of senators
questioned the need for this
whole procedure, and wanted
to talk to Kimbo about whether
the “problem” was severe
enough to merit the rather
strict measure.

The student Coordinator’s of-
fice has received numerous
complaints about line cutting at
the dining halls. Line cutters
are subject to $1 tines as they
were in the past, with house
presidents and senators enforc-
ing the rule and collecting the
tines. which go to SGA.

Finally, I have been asked
to inform the student body that
next week’s Senate Meeting,
Tuesday, Oct. 14, will be held
at 9:30 in Roberts Theater.
I urge all students to attend
[his meeting. The meeting will
question the role of the student
at the college.

Following a discussion wlth
President Glenn Leggett last
Friday, Dean Alice Low re-
scinded a controversial re-
definition of the resident ad<

policy that she had issued the
previous Wednesday.

The rescinded policy, which

Siudenls Organize
For Greater Voioe
In Decision-Making

Coinciding with recent iaculty
consideration of sludént attend-
ance at faculty meetings. a
broadsbased student movement
has been forming on campus
during the past two weeks with
the intent ot gaining more stu-
fem power in all areas of col-
ege decision-making,

The movement originated with
h group of student senators and
other interested students who
were dissatisﬁed with the pre<
sent role of students in college
decision-making. The group has
increased its ranks considerably
during the past weeks

Some one hundred students,
including at least one student
from each ﬂoor of every resi-
dence hall on campus, attended
a meeting last week to decide
how to proceed. Committees
were termed to write up pIeSEIl:
tallons to be delivered at an
open senate meeting next Wed-
nesday in Roberts Theater, and
those present decided to discuss
the decision-making role at stu-
dents with their hallmates and
encourage them to attend the
special senate meeting,

President Glenn Leggett’s
remarks to the faculty corp
cerning student participation

gal drug we have no other op-
tion than to report this to the
hearing board.”

Shortly alter Dean Law's re-
definition was announced last
Wednesday, some 250 angry
students gathered in [rent oi
Burllug Library to protest the
statement. The students then
went to the South Lounge where
they coniwnted Deans Low
and Connie Klmbu with ques-
tions and criticized the policy,
which they believed would
have undermined the counsel<
ing lllnction or resident ad-
visers.

“l rescinded the re-(lelinitiun
ml the basis that I felt that the
approach was wrong, although
the intent was not,” Dean Low
explained this week.

“It was being misinterpret-
ed." she continued. “and I
thought it was destroying the
role we had built up for the
resident advisers. It was sim-
pler to say i was wrong and
rescind it."

Asked why the redeﬁnition
was rescinded, Leggett this
week said that “it represented
a change in my understanding
of the function of the residen
advisers. '

“I think Mrs. Low felt that
her instructions to the RA's
were simply an implementation
of my drug policy,” the presi—
dent continued. “While I under-
stand Mrs. Law‘s position, I
can see how interpretation
could have concluded that it
was a new policy"

“At any rate,‘ I think we
need more discussion, and we
ought to leave things as they
are for a while," Leggett said.

P re s i d e nt Glenn Leggett
Tuesday reiuted reports by
Gi'innell's underground news»

knowledge about a curlelit in-

in the field of politics this

“Are you going to.express pub-

human beings who have minds
and who think, even as you pur-

On a more “intellectual"
plane, the singular narrow.

mark: "Oh, I believe in God,
but i don’t like o'rganized reli—

important things involved in
this statement are, again, un~

this: “i know virtually nothing

Having a Homecoming Queen
does the following things:

(1) It places a woman on n

(2) It establishes an image of
what every girl “ought to be"
or how she “ought to look.”

(3) It reinforces the idea that
Women should look beautiful,

and that’s what is most impure

(4) It encourages Women to

stead of the more important
human qualities:

(5) It ”honors” Caucasian
girls rather than non-Caucasian
girls, since .the latter usually
don't fit the society's standard

Women’s Liberation is I

ested in redeﬁning the Iemals
role. As a part of that group,
I would like to see Grinncll
College expand the possibilities
for women rather than limit:
them. The institution of Home'-

ed because it continues to focus
attention on women in a supere

be concerned about being

opium to 5&3 Report

To the Editor:
In the Sept. 13 issue of the 83:13,
on pg. 10, “Commencement Dis-
ruptions Reviewed,” the article
states that the white nrmbands
were mm to protest: the Viet-
nam War and Tan“! degreei
(Curtiss W. Tarr. now Assistant
Secretary to the US. Air Force,
was awarded an honorary Doc-
tor of Humane Letters degree
by Gi-innell—Ed.) Your state
nlent is false. Students and
faculty who were given ""14
bands were told that the arm-
bands were a protest of this
Vietnam War only. It hi wrong
to say that “one third of the

As with the American society,

the preeminent symptom of a
deeper conflict, and as such is

otentially the most fertile area
in which to begin a resolution
of that conflict. The following
suggestions should be considered
as a star-ting point in formulat—
ing a workable and non-faction-
al policy toward drugs and drug
use at Grinneli:

(1) organize the students al-

would attempt to work solutions
to individual problems or violaa
tions of a school wide policy

plinary action. Only in the eyenl
of flagrant or repeated viola»
tions would this committee then
refer to the hearing board.

(3) Formulate a student

(5) Establish a permanent

clude what is probably the most
extensive collection of books

contributed by individuals, in

Bradford Euloqixed

To the Editor:

If some sense could conceive
bly be found in Dr. Bradford's
death, it would have to emerge
from those who experienced the
power and grace of the man. A
quiet dignity lived there, pro-
jected through the power or
awesome intellect and scholastic
achievement. As a student who
admired hnn, who would seek
to eulogize him from a tragical-
ly peripheral position, 1 can
only attempt to remember and
fulfill the growth that this man
released within me, and to ask
from uncomprehendillg Death
a chance to dcscry the awesome-
noss of His deed.

I wondered many times at tho
extent of Dr. Bradford’s knowl-
edge, and the enormity of his

vision. One finds ill Yeats what
one would cherish most in End-
lord. and it is inevitably so, (or
why also would a man devote
himself with such obvious ador<
ation to a poet, unless poet and
critic had finally merged? His
Very Style of life called forth
the aristocratic shade that was
Yeats, called it forth and mods
it breathe with its own devotion,
so driven, so relined, so bewild<
ered by excess of love, To learn
from Bradford was to hold for
unbearable seconds the ﬂame
that poetry ignites, and to
mourn anew the chill that even
now creeps across in hand that;
once was warm.

We have our Visions and our
refuge; our dreaming refuses
to die in silence or in night. Let
there then be some salvation,
if only a ghost of hope within
disbelief. Let there be no end
to remembrance.

last faculty meeting by a pro
posal from the Committee on
Faculty Organization on student
participation in faculty meet-
ing was also carried a step
further and nearer at least
temporary resolution on Thurs
day. The earlier proposal was
a general one, calling for a
group of ten students to attend
and vote in all regular faculty
meetings, and shortly after it
was introduced, it was tabled
for future discussion.

The committee, headed by
Prof. Raymond Betts (History),
brought the matter up again
yesterday. This time, it was
recommended that the Commit-
tee on Faculty Organization get
together With the student senate
to appoint an adhoc committee
to bring recommendations be
for the faculty meetings on
student participation.

Meetings that students might
attend, however, were narrow-
ed from any regular meeting
to faculty meetings dealing
with curricular and general
educational policy. The Bette
committee foresees the student
senate electing the ad-hoc
students. The committee would
have an equal number of fac-
ulty and students, and their
lunciion would be to draw up
a formal proposal regarding
student attendance at faculty
meetings.

As a temporary measure, at
the next faculty meeting, Octlr
ber 23. the faculty will admit

SCARLET AND BLACK

- Alumna Describes Wisconsin Welfare Incident
A former Editor's teller to the Scarlet & Black

'(The tollowing letter is from
Susan Kaeser, who was editor
of the sen; last semester.
Graduated from Grimell last
spring, she has recently ac-
oepted a position with the
Omaha Sun.

The Rev. James E, Groppi,
referred to in Miss Kaeser’s
gloomy account of the recent
“occupation” of the Wiscon-
sin Assemhly hy welrare re~
cipients, is presently in jail
after heing held in contempt
of the Assembly The Wiscon-
sin Supreme Court last Tues-
day refused Groppi’s request
that he be freed on bond, and
postponed ruling on his col-t-
Iemion that he was jailed il-
legally under the lzlyear-old
state law, which does not pro-
vide for a hearing. —Ed.)

Dear Mike,

l‘m presently as distressed as
I’ve ever felt — i had to do
something about it so decided
to try writing it down. l thought
perhaps you would like to use
part of this as a letter to the
editor or the saga or a disturb-
ed graduate who tinally is get-
ling first hand information on
how the world . . . eats shit.

Word has trickled into Grin-
nell of the recent occupation or
the Capitol in Madison, or the
"confrontation with the legisla-
ture,” or “those lousy students
have to mess it up for every-
one." Things are really bad —
the poor have a valid gripe, the
rich control the poor, the poor

ipe, the rich stomp on them.

ere are several explosive
problems involved, all of which
really hring together just how
rotten everything ls and why.

This is the problem) the leg-
islature of Wisconsin cut aid to
welfare recipients. The welfare
recipients are hungry, they are
tired of their degraded situa-
tion of always being at the
hands of the men in the capital
or the welfare office. They got
organized, mustered up some
outside support, and decided to
assert their dignity and take
their case to the legislature.

Some marched 90 miles from
Milwaukee with their children
to demonstrate their situation,
and to take their case to the
lawmakers. Their problem is
clearly detined: they are hun~

islators that it is true so they
give the needed tunds for food.
It is a case of conlrontation
but with the goal of communia
cation. Since no one seemed to
listen before, they had to yell
a little louder.

The poor were naive enough
to Ihink that taking their case
to the men making the laws
would help. America is a de-
mocracy. Unfortunately those
people found out it doesn’t work
that way — thanks in emotion-
al hang-ups, the democratic
process has clearly deterior-
ated, and the poor have leani-
ed one more time that people
are unimportant to those mak-
ing laws The real tragedy is
the absolute lack of sensitivity
to a deep problem and an over-
sensilivity to a surface situa-

tion which seems to determine
govemrnent process.

This is what happened when
the people went to the legislav
ture: Monday alter-noon weliare
mothers and recipients from
around the state met for a ﬁnal
rally on the library mall at
the University of Wisconsin.
This rally gathered support
lrom thousands of students for
the tidal march to the Capitol
where they would take their
cause to the legislators. They
marched directly into the Capi-
to].

l arrived just as o group or
protesters broke down one door
leading to the chambers of the
state legislature, not yet in
session. it was rather an his-
torio moment, people occupy-
ing a big administration build
ing. Sort oi like storming the
basiille. So in we went and sud-
denly the whole chamber was
ilooded with proteslors; the gal<
ieries lilled, the comfortable
chairs occupied by Childr
students, and wellare reel -
ants; and the Commandos,
Brown Borers, welfare mothers,
and Father James Groppi were
in the front of the room.

propped a sign — “1 may be

wanted help. They were tired
of having their children cry
because they were hungry.
Some were tired of trying to
explain why they didn’t have
the things the white kids have.
They were tired of getting up
their hope and having it taken
away. They wanted their chil-
dren to go to school, get the
education necessary to com-

 

pete, but they had no way to
clothe themr They said repeat-
edly that welfare is no vaca—
tion — one doesn’t get rich on
welfare.

The rally continued until 2
pm. when the legislature was
supposed to convene. The legis-
lalorsrdidn’t show up, but plans
were made in preparation lor
their arrival. Strategies were
planned and the mothers cau-
cused to decide what exactly
they were going to say to the
legislators.

The legislature would con-
vene only if the floor were
cleared. Upon request from the
mothers, who wanted a chance
to meet the lawmakers, the
demonstrators cleared the
ﬂoor. As they moved, people
cleaned up debris, straightened
the comty chairs, and moved
to new positions in the gal-
leries. An amazing phenome-
non.

The legislators entered and
tilled their seats. The speaker
demanded that people clear the
ﬂoor iariher back and that
there be some kind of proper
decorum so that democracy
could function. Jeers from the
crowd, but the mothers once
again came to the microphone
and requested cooperation.
They were cheered and the
Crowd complied with their re
quest.

People moved and the speaka
er gaveied the session into or-
der. For a second there was a
tremendous feeling in that
room. The big powers (the
men with the money) were
there, the crowd was respond

New SAGA Checking System Causes Controversy

By Molly McGuIru

Has the Grinnell student ii<
nally been reduced to a num-

her? Is the new checking sys-
tent in the dining halls really
necessary? Or will it even do
the job it has been set up to
do —- namely, keeping the
eighteen students newly-ex-
empted from board lees out of
the dining halls?

These were just a iew at tho
questions raised as the new
checking method went into al-
tect last Monday at Cowles and
the Quad. The system, in at:
oordailce with a provision of the
referendum of last week allow-
log the eighteen exemption, re
quires each diner to give his
meal card number to a check-
er at each meal before eating.
Although this honor . number
system is not as strict as a
meal card presentation system,
it nevertheless is a change irom
the previous relaxed policy or
allowing entrance to the dining
halls without any term oi identi-
ilcation.

According to Business Man-
ager Ralph Poinerenk, both the
business oitice of the college
and Saga saw the need for some
way or checking who ate in the
dining halls, ii any option were
to be put into operation. “When

you have options or paylng
board or not,” Pometznk said,
“you have to have more than
the honor system iii the dining
halls. Saga can't teed everyone
that Comes to the door, and the
college can't administer the
program (of options) unless
there is some system of check-
ing who eats. We can’t aitord
3 ‘Come one, come all’ policy."

Pomerenk said that he had
originally recommended to the
Student Affairs Committee that
ii photo lD card system be in<
stituted, because such a system
would eliminate many prob-
lems created by the number
checking method. But the com-
mittee “worked him down" to
the present “nominal honor and
number" system. According to
Student Coordinator Frank
Thomas, the SAC decided that
the number system would he
the most efficient, yet minimal,
method the college would oc-
cept.

The checking system was
fully described in the referena
dum, and students voted their
approval. But there are come
plaints (presumably by the 700
students who either didn’t vote
or voted against the proposal)
about its very existence, its ei-
iectiveness, and the inconveni-

once it is causing by forcing
students to remember their one,
two or three-digit number and
tell it to a checker in the line.

One irate student voiced tho
complaint that he “didn’t mum
to Grinnell to be a number" and
that now Grinneli has joined
the "number cult" along with
big universities, Those sharing
this view, in order not to be
forced to go against their moral
principals, are allowed to show
the checker their meal card,
and thus bypass identitying
themselves by a number. (Ac-
tualiy, every student is not only
a meal card number, but also a
computer number to the col-
lege.)

Questions have been raised as
to the eiiectiveness of the new
system in keeping out non-
boarders since numbers could
be duplicated at both dining
halls and anyone can use any
number as long as it hasn't
been used already at a parti-
'cular meal. Fomerenk realizes
that the system has "potential

leaks," but none of these weak-
nesses were unanticipated. The
success or the system depends
upon the cooperation or the
boarders, or, as (Saga) Chuck
Hand, Food Service Director,
said, “the system will work as
well as the students want it to
work."

Several dissatisfied students
have suggested that instead or
checking all the diners, pictures
or the 18 be posted in each din-
ing hall, with perhaps a line im-
posed if they should show their
race in either place. The store-
mentioned disgruntled student
explained, “Atter all, we’re not
a vast, faceless mass, and it
isn’t fair to be inconveniencing
1100 people to be convenient ion
18.”

Tlils proposed “mug shot"
system would not be enough,
according to 'Tomerenk and
Hand, because there would be
no assurance that the non<
boarders would be recognized
and identified it they should
show up tor a free meal.

Since the checking system has
been in eiiect only live days,
all has not been said or realized
about it. Pomerenk feels that It
is “shaking down reasonably
well, and will probably gain
more acceptance as checker:
gain more speed.” Hand be<
lieves that like any new system.
It is an inconvenience at first,
but the situation will improve.

while the checking system in
receiving an untavorable stu.
dent response, that response is
not above criticism. Student Co-
ordinator Frank Thomas is “fed
up” with the negative student
response, and maintains that
the uncooperative students
(those refusing to y've their
number or those giving any
thing except their own number)‘
are causing most of tho incon-
venience.

“On a Saga issue." Thomas
assorted, “the student body
generally displays those adole<
scent actions and emotions
which are always expected or
it by the ‘other generation.‘ "

 

Judicial council: Mistrial In Clark Hail Case

By a do vote with one absten<
tion, the student taculty
Judicial Court, in its lirst meet-

ing of the year October 2, heard
the appeal or senior Patrick
Perry and junior Thomas Cole
and reversed a decision made
by the Clark Hall Council last
year, declaring a mistrial.

"The Clark Hall Council of
1968759 violated the judicial
saicguai-ds guaranteed in the
Student Handbook in that it did
not properly notify Patrick
Perry and Thomas Cole or the
hearing May 17, 1969 at which
they were lined," the council
ruled in a statement issued by
its chairman, Asst. Professor
Bernard Mergen (Am. Studies).
“The Judicial Council also finds

then acted too hastily. The
Judicial Council therefore der
clares a mistrial."

The case stemmed from two
hall parties given in Clark Hall
during the first semester of last
year. The first party, held in
the lounge during midsemester
break, Involved what Art An—
drews, a member of Clark
Hall's Council last year, de-
scribed as “an assault on tha
soia. Several guys were violente
ly jumping up and down on 't.
They even invited the Pagliai’s
Pizza man to join them,"

During exam time, there was
a second party in the rec room
in which two male students
were wrestling on the rug, as
the third, a visitor irom Purdue
University, pelted them with ice
cubes. This party finally re-
sulted in red, blue, and brown
stains on the rug from beer
and crepe paper,

The Physical Plant House-
keeping bepartment notiiied the
then President of Clark Hall,
Jim Sebern. ’69, that $350 in
damages was done to the rug
and Bola, and that the hall was
expected to pay ior the repairs.

Alter $85 was taken from hall
iunds. Sebern brought the mat-

‘ ter of the remaining sum before

the hall council.

the remaining lines to various
individuals according to their
participation in the damaging
activities.

According to Sebern's res

this action was never carried
out.

“The fine is Still on the hooks."

Patrick Perry and Thomas

days Of the academic year 1968a

that time, decided to hold it
over until the first meeting this
year.

In their ﬁrst meeting the
Judicial Council interviewed the

Born in Cedar Vale, Kant, on
sept. 23, 1922, Professor Jones

Before coming to Grinnell,
Professor Jones taught at the

years. He was a member of
the American Choral Directors

concerned citizens can devote
time and energy to the impor-
tant work of taking the issue
of peace in Vietnam to the lar-
361' community. “We call upon
all members or the university
community to support the mor-
atorium,” Fr 3 n k continued,
“and We commit ourselves to
organize this effort on our cams
pus and in the larger communv
ity. We ask others to join us."

Frank then discussed the ef-
iects of the war in Vietnam
upon the Grinnell conlniunity~
a loss of lives and a loss of
money for municipal projects.
He requested that “Grinnell in-
dicate to the President and the
Congress that now is the time
to end the confiicr."

councilman Jones spoke on
the resolution and introduced a
letter [mm the Grinnell Student
Committee on the Moratorium
on the war in Vietnam. The
committee requested the city
council’s approval to use down—
town park space to hold a rally
on October 15th. The rally will
include speakers irom the col-
lege Iaculty, college adminis«
tration and from the town of
Grinnell.

Jones requested an acknowl-
edgement oi the principle of
the Vietnam moratorium. "This
is a seriolls and rational at-
tempt to raise a discussion; not
a protest or a demonstration,”
he said. He cited that over 400
academic institutions have re-
spondedi t0 the Call and estimr
cited that two-thirds of the Grin-
nell College laculty and stu-
dents will participate in the
Moratorium. Jones stated that
the city councils acknowledge

.ment of the principle of the

Vietnam Moratorium would not
necessarily support the mora-
torium or Frank’s resolution,
but would "only recognize the
principle a! tree debate and dis-
cussion.”

After the council agreed to
place a two-hour limitation on
the use of Grihnell’s park,
Jones' motion was passed in
a unanimous chorus oi ayes.

A request by Frank that the
council recommend suspension
01 business in Grlnnell on Mora-
torium day was denied. The
council said it would leave to
individual business proprietors
the decision on whether to close
for the day.

The college will hire a praise

President Glenn Leggett.

"Everybody's agreed til at

but the question is when to pro-

"I’d like to have it finished by

"The trustees have approved

haven’t given any money yet,”
he continued. "I think it: would
be best to get some expert
advice before we proceed."

Leggett said that he plans to
discuss the Bookstore with the
student senate, and said that
he will try to locate a protes-
sional consultant before the
trustees meet in Grinnell Nov.

The Trustees believe that only the faculty, including the deans

of Students Alice Low that he
had been fined $25 for keeping

Tory in his dormitory room.

, “When I left California I
tried to find a good home for

Stranger commented, “so I had
no choice but to bring Tory to
school with me this semester."

Dean Low said Tuesday that
Stranger had come to see her
soon after the beginning or the
semester. "We tried to find

Still versive Clidllt Spree
Worries Woryﬂ & 6

By lda Gudema

While, most Grim-tell Students
have passively watched. the
dastardly sidewalk chalkers on
campus have been trying to
subvert the school through their
evil drawings on the concrete
But there is hope, tor the Build
lugs and Grounds workers have
arisen to save Grinnell from
this horrible plot.

The chalkers have repeatedly
tried to infiltrate the campus.
Their targets have included the
sidewalks in front of Carnegie
and outside of Conference
House. But their most Vile
deeds took place at Sunshine
Saturday, in front oi the
Forum, when they chalked in
ﬂowers, butterflies, and the
words, “Freedom Now," an ob-
vious subversive slogan. How-
ever, their propaganda soon
disappeared as 884G workers
and students joined to erase it.

One Chalker declared, “As
usual, this is an incredibly
archaic policy of B&G, and the
powers-that—be‘ 8&6 policies
are deﬁnitely ANTI-LIFE and
repressive of all creative stu-
dent endeavors such as side.
Walk chalking. This shall not
go unnoticed! The forces of lilo
shall arise againl Let a thou-
sand ﬂowers (and chalked side-

i

walks) bloom."

The voice of the workers;
Physical Plant Director, Dale
i-iawn, disagrees with this sink
plistic approach to the problem.
He feels that sidewalk chalking
is analogous to defacing a
building, Hawn said BBLG has
no speciﬁc policy about the
Chalkings, but explained that
the chalk penetrates lhe side-
walk aild becomes impossible
to remove. This occurred after
last year’s “Happening," when
the workers weren’t alerted.
and some of the chalk still lin<
gers on.

l-lawn staunchly defends the
common student, who he s ys,
is as proud of the facil tell
as everyone else. He thinks
most students don’t want on
work on the sidewalks; he
stated, “The strong silent ma-
jority feels concrete should look
like concrete."

Where is the strong silent
majority? Will Grinnell students
allow the chalkings to continue?!
Will the college become a haven
for sidewalk chalkers? What
will happen to Grinnell's repu.
tation? One sidewalk chalker
has announced, “Massive chalk.
ins should begin immediately."
The future looks ominous, to
say the least.

An 5&3 photographer caught these twa “agitators" challn
writing on a campus sidewalk. Note the subversive look in

their eyes.

A Short Guide 11) Hiiollhiking

By Tom Thomas

This treatise is intended to
help those spirited souls ivho
for love of adventure or lack
of cash set out to cross the un-
known by thumb. Developed
through experience, my own
ond Others, at least one of
these hints may help to speed
you on your way.

Planning The Trip — Unless
you are extremely tamiliar
with the area you will be trav-
elling, pick up a map. You
may not wind up going exactly
the way you planned. Try to
stay on heavily travelled
routes. The best way to get
stranded is to be let nut on a
county road. Stay away trom
tollways and turnpikes. Lots or
hassles irom cops there. Avoid
going through cities unless you
plan to stay in one. Once you
are into a city it is oiten very
diiiicult to get out. Plan to av-
erage between 30-54) mph tor
any distance over four hours
normal driving distance.

Preparations — Take the
phone numbers of as many
people as possible who live be
tween your origin and destina-
tion. Take some addresses, tool
Make sure you have enough
cash. Twenty dollars is a good

amount. Have it in small bills
and keep it in several tliiierent
places, i.e. pockets, shoe, wal-
let. Also take a couple oi dimes
in case you have to make a
phone call. it you get hungry,
raisins or small boxes or sug-
ared cereal are good. Hershey
bars melt. cheese and imit
don't hold up, and candy makes
you thirsty. Have a good LD.
Take a plastic laundry bag to
use for a raincoat.

The Sign — it you are going
a long distance, a sign otten
helps. Don't be iancy. Beautiful

Mineral Pa’rier' Abbey Road

By L. Angelo Mysterioso

The Beatles controversy con-
tinues to rage, but their music
seems to suffer not at all.
Rumors on campus persist that
a secret island or part or an
island exists; to there, devout
groupies (of any sex) with sui-
ficient information about the
"mystery," are whisked.

The Beatles' new album,
Abbey Road is allegedly named
for a London street also called
Abbey Lane. Since Abbey Lane
is the exrwﬂe of Cuban band-
leader xavier Cugat, this has
been seen as a relerence to
Cuba. It is also pointed Out
that (luring midrlﬂﬁﬂ Fidel Cas~
tro's speeches began to show
what many hard-core users be-
lieve to be the influence of
LSD. This was the same time
that the Beatles were getting
into acid, and coincidentally,
shortly after the death oi nov-
elist - iolksinger - Cuban revolu-
tionary - acid freak Richard
Farina. it has been reported
that Farina’s body was never
positively identitied.

Sn . . . Beatles freaks reason
that these facts (plus the rash
of airline hijackings by apo-
litical freaks. from which
nights certain passengers dis»
appeared and vanished without
a trace. their names stricken
from company lists) point to
Cuba as the new Atlantis, a re-
orlsen “Ostopils’s Garden," a
pleasure garden presided over
by Gurus Dick, Fidel, John,
Paul, George and Ringo, invit-

ing us to “come together, right
now, over me.”

But, I don’t believe any of
that shit. In this tight new rec-
ord composed 01 16 brief
tracks, Paul (even if his shoes
are off on the jacket) and the
others are very much alive and
making beautiful music. As al-
ways, the Beatles provide us
with the main event of the
musical season. it goes without
saying that George Martin
(who some say doesn't exist)
has done a fine job of moms
trating and arranging, the
lyrics are great, etc. . . . And
the music gets better, it pos-
sible a Ringo is starting to
learn how to play the drums,
and George's guitar is getting
better all the time - two cuts
with the broken Chnrcl technique
of the type used on “Badge”
stand out _ “You Never Give
Me Your Money” and “Carry
That Weight."

And the Beatles are Germin—
ly trying to tell us something.
They're still preaching, but it’s
all right because along with all
the fantastic music they have
something to say to everyone
of us; be it the reminder that
“once there was a way to get
back homeward" — but now
it's too late, and we'll have I!)
“carry that weight for a long
time” — we just can’t get back
any more; or the ultimate
Iruth:

“And in the end the love you
take
ls equal to the love you make."

hitch. That's the first thing a
cop looks ior. it you must,
don't keep them on you while
you are smnding by the road.
Find an innocent looking can
~ sardine cans work well —
and place your stash. Set it
next to you while getting a
ride. Pick it up when you get
in a car (unobtrusively, or
course). it a cop asks, you've
never seen the can before.

where To Stand — oti the
pavement. You can get busted
in most states it you have one
toe on the road. Shoulders are
generally sate. When hitching
on interstates, stand down on
the ramp, not up on the high
way. (Unless no cars are com»
ing up the ramp.) Few cars
going 75 will stop. It's also il-
legal to be on the interstate.
Flnd a place where a car can
pull over to stop If you are
standing in tront of a bridge,
you aren't going to get a ride.
Standing near lights or stop
signs is another good trick. You
can give stopping cars the
pleading look much more effec~
tively.

[1' A Cup Stops You — You
are a student. Whip out your
ID. Be cool. You are going
home to see your mother, or
your dying aunt.

At Night — Wear light col~
ored clothes. If you have a
sign, pick up a couple or his
sign, pick up a couple of bicycle
reflectors (15 cents) and put
street lights, hotel signs, etc.
You've got In look really whole-
some. lt you don’t have light
Colored clothes, tie a handker-
chiet around your arm.

The Undesirable Driver — if
you decide the guy that picket!
you up isn’t where it’s at, get
out! Whip out your road map
and peering at it intently, tell
him you get off at the next
crossroad. it you already told
him where you are going, tell
him you are stopping to see a
triend. it he wants your mon-
ey, give him the three dollars
in your Wallet and tell him
that’s all you have besides the
dimes in your pocket and it he
needs it, he Can have it and
no hard teeliiigs. Don’t get
tense and maybe he'll stay ree
laxed. Just get out as soon as
possible.

Where To Get Out — Get out
where you can get another ride.
It’s olten better to get out at
a turnroll to a big city than at
Pndunk two miles down the
road. it a driver is going to No-
where, always get out at the
last Somewhere betore you get
there. Don't get stranded. Al-
ways ask the driver where he’s
going beiore you get in the car.
Short rides are generally a
waste unless you think it will
get you to a better place to
hitch from.

The most important thing to
successful hitching is to think
before you go. Good travelling.

 

The Love Feast

By J. Bainbl’idge Shook

Ahl Trixl, as thou art now before me stretched
Into my mind ﬂaw thoughts not too far fetched

For like a banquet table outlayer]
To thine lover thou appearest, fair maid.

I know not where to start on this feast of mine
The fare's so large, and I alone am to dine.

Which ol your juices should hrst touch my lip?
into which treat should i let my hand first dip?

Were l a child, your hair spun sugar would be
But now 'tlS more like spaghetti to me.

For sauce, thine natural unction serves well _
Far better than the tomato in smell,

Nor at this point do you fail me to please
Your dandroit will do in place or grated cheese.

nors d'oeuvres by your tace are supplied
To be munched when cocktails are embibed.

To me, your blemished forehead is bluecheese
Resting on eyebrow-like crackers with ease

Your eyes: Two oysters on the halishell,
Garnished by their own translucent gell.

in your nose I see a taurty baker’s skill,
For as an eclair it can’t retain its till.

On most women your mustache would be but skuz,
But on you it closely resembles peach luzz.
Your oral district does me amaze

For your vermillion lips with their red blaze

Do me remind oi pomegranate skin.

Kissing you is to this iruit akin;

Your tongue the pulp; your teeth the pits
The juice? — The blood irom all your zits.

Thy breasts by their yellow aspect
Resemble grapeiruits, in eilect —

Each garnished on its penult
With a shiny marischino.

Your stomach, to me at least, does seem

A limpid pool or dairy cream —

Your bellybuttnn a transient artichoke
Floating aimlessly, as though life were a joke.

Next, to thine chalice do my lips creep
To sip the nectar which there does seep.

With this sweet liqueur 1 end my feast
Sated, tull; my hungei-s surceased.

My banquet done. i make to go
But as I leave. . . What? a check? on nol

At the practice lock in Pall-
sades-Kepler, Asst. Prolessor
Robert Christiansen (math) was
showing new rock climbers the
ropes.

“0n belay," called the be-
ginner, inspecting the bowlina
knot around his middle. That
meant that he had one end of a
rope securely holding him.

“On belay,” irom overhead.
Thai mean that another climber
tied to a tree on top. had the
other end secure, to stop ialls.

"Climbing."

“Climb." He found iingers
holds and lodges as he went up
the practice rock. His belayer
took up the slack rope irnm
above. ~

“Fallingi” the Climber yelled.
He wasn’t really in a precariour
position. This was a practice
rail. Wondering it this belaying
thing was really going to work,
he grabbed the rope and pushed
away from the rock. Dangling,
ha yelled “Slack.” The belayer
let him down easy.

Everyone took a turn belaying

one hand to save someone else
from falling. But it worked

It was also scary to back off

though the rig ior “rappelling"
looks reasonable, it is a matterI

Rappeiling is a way ior a
climber to lower himself down
a cliii on a rope. He is attached
to the rope with another rope
sling and some hardware which
exerts friction. The rappel rope,
in one method, runs behind one
leg, held in front with the brake
hand (gloved ior skin's sake.)
The brake hand can control the
speed as the climber slides
down the rope, He pushes him-

outstretched ieet, as he lowers.
