Leggett Nixes
Senate Call for
Business Halt

Despite o student senate
rmlutinn urging that “stu»
dents, faculty, administration
and staff cease business as
usual Nov. 13-14 in observance
of the Vietnam Moratorium.“
President Glenn Leggett said
Monday, “We're not going to
close up.”

In a memorandum released
Wednesday Leggett announced,
”I have directed that not only
the food and heating facilities
remain open but also that other
services (including the library,
the Forum, maid service,
health services, and the
Bookstore) remain open
November 13 and 14.”

The Nov, 3 senate resolution
had asked that all “non-
essential services" be closed for
the Moratorium and said “that
those who continue business as
usual implicitly sanction our
nation’s continued involvement
in Viemam.“

in an opinion referendum held
in lunch lines Monday. a
majority of the students voting
expressed support for the
senate position. The final vote
was: Agree-390; Disagree-315;
Undecided-ll).

in the memorandum Leggett
also said that he had asked
“supervisors of non-in-
structional departments to give
their employees the option of
working or not working. . ."

Leggett's memorandum ex-
plained that the decision on
whether or not to maintain
services had to be based not
on “the question of majority
versus minority opinion” but
rather “on the nature of a free
and liberal college, which does
not deny its members access
to normal services and
prerogatives simply because
some of the members have
opinions different from those of
others."

The president Monday ex-
pressed concern about ”all
kinds [If rumors that students
are planning to close down
operations by taking over the
library and the Forum."

“1 don't know what kind of
precautions could be taken." he
said “If it happens we’ll have
to deal with it as it happens."

Faculty Retains Moratorium Policy

in a special meeting Monday
the faculty approved by a 60-25
written vote the following
resolution regarding the Nov.
13-14 Vietnam Moratorium:

‘ ‘ T h e Grinnell faculty
recognizes the significance of
the Vietnam Moratorium by
emphasizing each individual
faculty member‘s and student's
option to observe the
Moratorium as he chooses."

The resolution is identical to
the one passed by the faculty
in regard to the October 15
Moratorium.

According to Asst. Prof. John
H. Wurley, faculty secretary, it
is implicit in the resolution that
students or faculty members
who do not attend classes
during the Moratorium will not
be penalized

However, Dean Joseph Wall
issued a memoradum on the
faculty decision Monday that
said: “The college does have
a contractual relationship with
its students regarding class
instruction, and the faculty
in e m b e r should make
provisions with the students in
the classes he has missed, for
whatever reason, to cover the
work, either through special
meetings of the class or in-
dividual conferences with the
students who desire such
meetings."

in Monday’s meeting Wall
asked the faculty in taking
action to separate the Novem»
ber Moratorium from the Dec»
ember Moratorium. which may
coincide with the final
examination period.

“If that happened, it would

call for a different kind of in-
stitutional consideration.” Wall
said He asked that faculty
allow the Academic Standing
Committee “to consider
alternatives" so that it can then
recommend a faculty position
on the December, and other
future Moratoriums, which are
expected to last until the War
ends, increasing in length by
one day each successive monthr

Polarization was evident
Monday as the faculty debated
the Moratorium issue.

Prof. Neal w. Klausner
(Philosophy) took the floor to
say that although he opposed
the War and “the stupid fulmin-
aticns of (Vice President Spiro)
Agnew,” he planned to hold
classes as scheduled. “I will
protest in my own manner,"

Klausner declared, “i don’t in-
tend to be threatened or
coerced by the senate statement
or by anybody."

Klausner was referring to a
student senate resolution urging
that Grinnellians cease business
as usual during the Morator-

ium. The resolution said that
“those who continue business as
usual implicitly sanction our
nation‘s continued involvement
in Vietnam."

Profs John R. Kleinschmidt
(French), chairman of the
faculty, reminded the faculty to
consider the “question of the col-
lege's contract with students”
and the “possible effects of sus-

Students Canvass
local Residents
In Nov. Action

By Mark Graeser

Some 150 college students and
a smattering of high-school stu-
dents and townspeople went into
town last night to talk with
people about the war. The can
vassing of the toWn was the
main thrust of the November
Vietnam Moratorium which
began yesterday and is con-
tinuing today.

Moratorium organizers, led
by freshman Berry Zigas,
divided Grinnell’s estimated
2000 resident units into blocks
of 20 units Students were urged
to go in pairs. preferably a boy
and a girl. Actual canvassing
got underway at 7 p.m. last
night.

Earlier yesterday afternoon
each unit was leafletted with
mimeographed “fact sheets,"
giving information and
statistics on the Vietnam war.
Another leaflet, entitled “The
Johnson-Nixon policy in Viet-
nam continues," was adapted
from an article in LF. Stone's
Weekly, “The Con Game of
‘Withdrawal’ From Vietnam.”

Organizers hoped the leaflets
would facilitate discussion later
Thursday when students went
to speak to townspeople about
the war.

The emphasis of the town-
gown dialogue was expressed
by junior John Otto at a Thurs-
day morning meeting of the
Moratorium Committee: “We
can’t force ourselves on them
(townspeople). We have to
speak in their language and not
use big words. We have to leave
their country alone. They must
see us as patriots trying to
improve their Country."

Zigas urged people to wear
a suit and tie if possible,
“Because people judge you on
your appearance." For some,
the desire to be accepted into
town homes led to hair-cuts,
which were administered in
North Lounge by a crew of
nimble-fingered barberettes.

if all the preparation paid off
and students gained access to
a house, they were instructed
to project friendlinms and an
open mind. As Zigas put it,
”tell people you are concerned
about the war and you want
to know how they feel."

In the event or a person ex-
pressing dissatisfaction at the
way Nixon is handling the war,
particularily if the person wants
a more rapid withdrawal, they
are being urged to write to
their elected officials in Wash-
ington, and in addition are

J/Lcé‘imattc ﬂoat

By Henry Scheff

At a mass‘meeting attended
by some 250'students Tuesday
night in-Roberts Theatre,
the Grinnell Student Senate
passed _.a resolution endorsing
the basic philosophy of the
Student Positiori' Paper. The
students at the rneeting'elected
a six»man steering committee
to sort‘ through amendments
and to Inlake recommendations
at an open ’h—leeting next week.
After the senate has acted on
the amendments, the Position
Paper will be submitted to the
student body for an all-campus
referendum.

The six members elected to
the steering committee are
Phil Mears, Bill -Stranger,
“Gene” Prewo (who impressed
the meeting with his incisive
criticisms), Steve Schwartz,
Bruce Nissen, and Mick
Schaalman. Specifically, they
have the following powers:

1) They will divide the
amendments into two groups,
substantive amendments and
“nit - picking” amendments.
They will make block recom»
mendations on tihe "nit-
pickers” to the Senate,
moving that they accept the
amendments that they feel ap-
propriate and reject the others.
Then, the Senate will consider
the substantive amendments
one at a time for approval.

2) They will have immediate
negotiating and discussion
power and authority, so that
they may meet with adminis-
trators and faculty without
delay. There are many areas
of college governance that the
student body is ignorant of,
and this committee can begin
to work on these matters. The
faculty and administration are
anxious to begin discussions
with the students.

The steering committee will
also have the duty of informing
the student body of the sub-
stance of the discussions that
ﬂiey will be carrying out with
the administration and faculty.
This liaison function is crucial
to maintaining student interest
and support for the issues
raised by the Position Paper.

A number of suggestions and
amendments were made at the
beginning of the meeting, but
basically only a couple of im-
portant things were cleared
up. The preamble will be
“cleaned up” by the steering
committee because it is gram-
matically weak. The wording
of one sentence was changed,
and more will probably be
done. The essence of the pre
amble is at this date un-
changed.

The most important debate
of the meeting concerned the
necessity of including Section I
of the Proposals for Structural
Change, the creation of the Co
ordinating Council of the Col-
lege. Gene Prewo argued that
if the purpose of the paper
was to democratize or decen-
tralize the decisionrmaking
power of the college, then the
proposed Coordinating Council
was inconsistent with this phil-
osophy, and it ought to be
eliminated.

Bruce Nissen was sympa-
thetic to Frewo’s argument,
but he felt that the student-

faculty-administration commit-
tee was needed at the top as
a check on President Leggett,
who legally has the final pow.
er in college decisions.

Tom Thomas pointed out
that the Council as proposed
did not wield very much pow-
er; it could make recommen-
dations and had veto power
which could be overturned by
a two-thirds vote.

The students at the meeting
felt that the advantages of hav-
ing a Coordinating Council out-
weighed the disadvantages,
and voted to keep Section I
as part of the proposed docu-
ment.

There were several impor-
tant amendments to the section
on the All-Campus Judicial
Council, Section IV, Part C,
Number 3, '(Procedures)
clauses “d" and “er” Clause
“d” was amended to state that
written records of Judicial
Council proceedings shall be
kept, and the defendant has
the option of having his name
on the record or not. The ra-
tionale for this is that the
council needs records of all
cases to establish clear prece-
dents, but should still protect
the individual from further
harassment due to any punish-
ment that he may have re-
ceived from the Council,

Clause ”e” was amended to
clarify the fact that the
President in appeal cases does
not have the power to increase
punishment. He may uphold
the Judicial Council decision,
lighten the punishment, or dis-
miss punishment completely if
he so desires, at his own dis-
cretion.

If any student has amendr
ments to the document, submit
them immediately if not soon
er to one of the members of
the steering committee, Come
to the next couple of senate
meetings if you are interested
in what happens to the amend-
mentsi When the referendum
is announced. study the amend-
ed document carefully and
then vote. Power to the people!

The senate has gotten into
the habit of holding quicky
meetings before the large Stu-
dent Body meetings, and Tues»
day’s meeting was no excep-
tion. The senate Tuesday acted
on a number of important
matters. First, the Senate al-
lotted an additional 550 for the
Conspiracy 8. Contribu-
tions were rather poor during
John Froines' Visit, totaling
maybe $100. The PPPE was
expected to kick in another
$100 to help defray costs, but
for some reason the PPFE de-
cided that this was not an ap-
propriate way to use their
money.

The Senate had originally al-
located $150 from the speakers
fund. With the extra $50, that
gives the Conspiracy about
$300, out of which they had
to pay Froines‘ expenses. Con-
'sidering the importance of the
trial. this “outpouring" was
pathetic indeed. Only $100 in
direct contributions” although,
as Froines so painfully stated.
we are all on trial in Chicago.

Senator Dave Eroadwell
submitted a motion to strike
the controversial “implicit sup

postcards Will then be sent in
bulk to the Moratorium office
in Washington, D.C., where they
will be sent to the White House.

Plans for today included
continued canvassing of the
town and a scheduled collection
of garbage around Lake Nyanza
Park on the south edge of town.
Evidently some townspeople
suggested the action as a
means of improving campus-
community relations, and the
Moratorium Committee felt it
would be in keeping with the
aim of the Moratorium. Its
aim, expressed in a statement
released Wednesday, “is to di-
rect our energy into the com
munity.”

That statement further ems
phasized that the Moratorium
is to be an individual commit-
ment, and not an attempt to
close down the institution of
Grinnell college “simply for
the sake of shutting it down.”

Class attendance seemed
markedly decreased Thursday
morning, but to what degree
“business as usual” was halted
is impossible to determine.
Asked to estimate how many
professors held classes
yesterday, Dean Joseph F. Wall
replied, “I have no idea.”

Moratorium days were not
business as usual, however, for
an estimated 80 Grinnell stu-
dents who went to Washington
for the “March Against Death,”
nor for another 46 students who
went to Des Moines last night
to picket a speech by Vice
President Spiro Agnew.

Charges Dropped
Against Two Here
At Chicago Trial

Charges against two Grinnell
students arrested while in Chi»
cago during last month's 5135
action were dropped last Fri-
day during a Chicago trial.
Senior Charles Garman had
been Charged with possession
of a concealed deadly weapon,
and freshman Scott Davies had
been charged with disorderly
conduct.

Garman and Davies were
stopped by police while driving
in Chicago Oct. 10, because of
faulty orakelights on Garman's
car. They then went to the po-
lice station to post bond, and
one of the officers found a
tear gas pen while searching
the car.

In court last week, the de-
tendants’ lawyer alleged that
the search of the car was ille-
gal, since the arresting offi—
cers had no reason to enter the
car unless they had seen
something suspicious from the
outside. Because of that alle-
gation, and the fact that the
policemen to l d conflicting
stories under oath, the judge
granted a motion to suppress
the evidence found in the
s e a r ch. Consequently, there
was no case for the other
charges, and they were
dropped.

The judge also ordered the
brakelight violation to be
dropped. He said the normal
procedure for such an offense
was a warning to the driver to
fix the lights.

The case was the last of four
Grinneli students arrested and
charged in Chicago during the
demonstrations. Earlier, fresh-
man Deborah Feldman was
placed under court supervision
for six months for running
away from the scene of a
broken window, Freshman Kay
Sophar was fined $500 for re-
sisting arrest and disorderly
conduct.

 

Quote of the week: “I
feel that managing a col-
lege now is like managing
a college on the Virginia-
South Carolina border dur-
ing the Civil War with
troops from both sides pass-
ing through.” Glenn Leggett

John Froines: "Our Cultdre Is on Trial"

By Ida Gudema

“What‘s happening in Chi»
cago has nothing to do with the

anti iot act. Our culture is on
trial. What's really on trial is
our survival," John Froines, a
member of Chicago’s “Conspir-
acy 8,” told approximately 200
students last Saturday after
noon in Roberts Theater.
Froines, a chemist, is accused
of conspiracy in connection
with the demonstrations at the
1968 National Democratic Cone
vention.

Commenting on the trial,
Froines said, “What’s happen-
ing to us in the court in Chi—
cage is the same thing that
happened in the streets of Chi-
cago last summer." He ex-
plained that statement by say-
ing the defendants are being
brutalized legally in the court-
room rather than by the police
in the streets. He added,
“We're surviving, and we're
winning.”

Froines said he feels the
most important part of the
trial has been events involv-
ing Bobby Seale, one of the de-
fendants, Seale, N a t i o 11 a1
Chairman of the Black Panther
Party, was recently gagged
and shackled in the Courtroom.
He has since been sentenced
to four years for Contempt of
court, and a mistrial has been
declared for him.

Froines described S e ale ' s
gagging as a symbolic attempt
to gag the Black Liberation
Movement in America. He
said, “No matter how hard
they try, they can’t gag him,
and they can't gag the Pan-
thers.” Froines also accused
the news media of telling only
half the truth. He said they
emphasize Seale’s verbal at-
tacks on Judge Julius Hoffman,
rather than his attempt to de-
fend himself. since he has been
forced to accept a lawyer ap-
pointed by the court.

While encouraging anyone in.
terested to come to Chicago to
see the trial, Froines Warned
that anyone with long hair, a
beard. or “looking like a hip.
pie” will not be admitted.
Those who are admitted are
searched several times. Once
in the courtroom, Froines said,
any spectator who smiles,
talks, laughs, or makes any

JOHN FROINES

other suspicious movements is
immediately expelled.

Although painting a ludi-
crous picture of the trial,
Froines stressed that it is no
joke. He said people tend to
see it as a burlesque. but it
isn’t. since all the defendants
expect to be tound guilty and
be sent to jail. He said, “We
are trapped in the courtroom.
There is no way to escape it
for us."

in order to stop the trial,
Froines encouraged the audi-
ence to go to Washington this
week to participate in the
march to the “Department of
Injustice." He also urged stu-
dents to send letters to the
judge or other government of-
ficials to Stop the trial.

Speaking of this week’s ac-
tion in Washington, Froines ex-
pressed his belief that the per—
mit would be granted for the
massive march on Saturday.
(The permit has been granted.)
He also said any violence in
Washington would be caused
by the police, not the demon<
strators, since all of the protest
leaders, including the most
militant, have denounced the
use of violence. He said, “If
anyone has the gaul to use vio-
lence that will hurt us, he
doesn’t belong in the Move»
ment."

Other comments Froines
made in his speech and dur-
ing a question-and-answer pe-
riod:

0n the trial m “We are in
contempt of that court. We figr
lire We all have about two
years (in jail)."

On the judicial system —
“There's basically no justice in

this land." He called Judge
Hoffman a fascist, but explain-
ed that Hoffman is only an
agent of Attorney General
Mitchell and Nixon,

0n Vice - President Spiro
Agnew — “Agnew is the dead
center of the Nixon adminis-
tration, maybe even a little libs
eral.” He later added, “Age
news right on,” since he une
derstands what's happening in
America.

On the recent SDS Chicago
action — “The Conspiracy sup-
ports any demonstrations that
support us. . . . We must look
beyond the broken windows, to
the political State. We're not
going to create violence — at
least I'm not —- but We must
understand that there is vio-

lence because of Vietnam, not
because of the Weathermen."

0n society — “We want to
be free . . . to have a society
not hung up on property rights.
Society has to fit the needs of
the people in it, not an elite."

On his future — “I don’t
want to leave the country, I
want to work here. . . . After
I get out of jail, the govema
merit will persecute me, but i
have to keep on doing what I
do.”

During the morning, Froines
spoke to a Political Science
class and a group in the
Science Building. Letters or
contribuaons to the Conspir-
acy can be mailed to 28 E.
Jackson Blvd, Chicago, Illi-
nois, he said.

 

Black Historian Redding Calls for
Application of Humanistic Knowledge

By John Gardner

Professor Saunders Redding
of George Washington Univerr
sity drew an estimated 200 stu-
dents to a Tuesday lecture on
the “Black Reaction to Post»
Reconstruction America,“ in
the American Civilization 225
lecture series. Redding. the
author of several books on
black history and literature,
delivered a scholarly and quiet
speech, using many or the as-
sumptions of black identity in-
herent in what he called the
“new Negro" Consciousness,
but avoiding the anger and
Verbalized frustration equally
inherent in recent Movement
statements.

His rocus was “the applica-
tion of humanistic knowledge”
to racial problems. He saw a
post—1954 Zeitgeist (spirit-of»
the-times) as a determining
factor in black and white prob»
lems. This spirit was one of
the translation of the wishes of
black people into legal actions.
such as desegregation deci-
sions of the Supreme Court.

However, Redding said, “No
man m black or white — so-
cialized in America in the past
century can escape the effects
of racism." He said that a hu-
manistic revolution is impera-
tive because the law alone

“will not free the black man
from the effects of his sell-re-
jection.“

Preferential treatment for
the black man in America
seems to Redding to be the
natural course, and he rejects
a once-common notion that the
solution to black problems
could come by the same
means as the solution to Irish,
Jewish, and Italian friction.
The very fact of color mili<
tated against the ease of this
optimistic idea; Redding put
Blacks, Mexicans, and Italians
in roughly the same place as
far as easy assimilation into
the “melting pot” (a term
Redding also questioned).

“We must determine to-
gether,” he added, “where the
primary areas of policy con-
cern are,” coming out strongly
in favor of “pluralism, individ-
ual assimilation, and desegre-
gation." The black man, he ex-
plained “wants no one out —
he wants in.”

The respect of the audience,
coupled with their apparent
lack of enthusiasm might pos-
sibly be reflected in the differ-
ence in titles between one of
Redding's books, On Being a
Negro in America, and the
contemporary Nigger by Dick
Gregory, Near the end of his
speech, Redding declared, “In
short, I advocate equality. Pe-
riod.” Gregory. however, in
his autobiography, regards the
advocacy of equality to be so
obvious that he spends little
time discussing it formally.

Questioned by a student on
what he thought about Afro
haircuts and dashikis, Redding
replied that he saw the value
of distinctive styles in reaf-
firming black identity, a value
which came out, often subtly,
in all of his remarks. The com-
pensatory or preferential
treatment he saw as necessary
for the black man in America,
and which has been supported
by Whitney Young of the Ur-
ban League focuses, “direct»
ly," Redding said, on “400
years of mistreatment”; this
statement was one of the few
that Redding made which re-
vealed a suppressed anger be-
neath his systematic, practical
and humanistic attitude toward
racial problems, 1969.

brief occupation of the city of
Hue and fifteen years ago
when, as the President stated,
the Communists murdered 50,-
000 North Vietnamese, _

The so-calied “March Against
Death" is actually a March For
Death because it is sponsored
by a basically Communist or-
ganization to serve a Commun-
ist purpose in Vietnam that
would bring death to untold
thousands. Each marcher is to
carry a sign with the name of

an American who died for free-
dom in Vietnam and call out
the name of the deceased as he
marches. These marchers should
tell the full story of each man
killed by adding to their signs
and to their chant these words:
“KILLED by COMMUNISTS."
if they were really protesting
death in Vietnam the marchers
would also carry signs bearing
the names of each of the 3,000
civilians killed in Hue last year,
and the 50,000 killed in North
Vietnam fifteen years ago.

The November 14 Student
Strike is actually a strike for
Revolution and Communism.
J. Edgar Hoover testified on
April 17 of this year that the
sponsor of the strike. the Stua
dent Mobilization Committee
“is controlled by members if
the Young Socialist Alliance, the
youth group of the Socialist
Workers Party." The Socialist
Workers Party (SWP) is the
party of the Trotskyist Com-
munists in this country and has
been cited as subversive by the
Attorney General.

What does the Young Social-
ist Alliance (YSA) stand for?
Read what one of its own mem~
bers, Jose Rudder, says. Rudder
is an exserviceman who former.
ly belonged to the Communist
Farty's youth group, the Dubois
Clubs, and was also a member
of the Communist Party itself.
He left them, he says, “greatly
disillusioned about the whole
left." Then, according to his
own story, he began to think
about things and to read the
literature of the Young Social-
ist Albance (YSA) and its par.
ent group. the swp. He came
to the following conclusion:

“i was a Marxist, a commun—
ist, and l believed in the revo—
lution . . . the only organization
that 1 could see that was con-
cerned about . . . seeing the rc~
volutlon take place in this
country was the YSA. So l de»
clded to join." (Young Socialist,
official YSA magazine, April,
1969, pages 10 and 11).

Remember: Vietnam is Coma
munism’s War a not Nixon's
war. The revolution that Jose
Rudder wants in the U.S.A. is
the revolution the Viet Cong
have launched and are fighting
in South Vietnam — with the
help of North Vietnam, Peklng

Disagrees with Rubenstein
To the Editor:

1 would like to raise some
points which I feel should be
considered by other people who
attended Dr. Richard L. Ruben
Stein’s three lectures and his
panel discussion.

Dr. Rubenstein’s talks raise
some important questions,
among them this one: Does the
God of Scripture command cer-
tain things because they are
intrinsically right and good,
or are things right and good
because God commands them?
People inside the Judeo-Chris-
tlan tradition have taken both
positions on this issue. But Dr.
Eubenstein assumes that only
one position, the latter. exists.
That position is probably the
less defensible one. since it can
lead to the conclusion that God
might equally well have com-
manded nlen to hate one another
and Him. making hatred right.
But if the former position is
taken, then or. Rubenstein's
argument that the God of Scrip.
ture wills things arbitrarily falls
apart, as does his claim that
every man can decide for him-
self what is right.

it is not surprising that Dr.
Rubenstein does not [incl his
conception of the Scriptured
God to bc a very friendly ligure.
(Though His lack of appeal
would hardly provide grounds
for a man to assert His nonvex-
istcncc.) But, as Mr. Burklc
pointed out in the panel dis-
cussion, this tyrannical, caprici-
ous iathcr figure of Dr. nuben.
Stein's is an inadequate view
of the Scriptural God. Does this
figure have anything in common
with the God of the Old Testa-
ment — the God who consistent»
ly responded to the rebellion
of His people by forgiving them
and renewing His covenant with
them, who punished only as a
last resort to lead the people to
repentance? Or with the God of
the New Testament, who loved
man so much that He became
a man Himself and dled for all
men, so that they might receive
forgiveness and a fulfilling, sata
isfying life? Dr. Rubenstein is
attacking a straw figure, a God
of his own creation.

in his assertion that one can
reconcile Auschwitz with the ex-
istoncc of the Scriptural God on-
1y by making Auschwitz the will
of that Cod, Dr. Ruhenstein is
handling the difficult problem
of evil much too simplistically.

To fix the blame for Auschwitz,
he might more fruitfully begin
with a consideration of the
Philospher he admires so much,
Hegel. To justify the murder of
three million Russian kulaks
and the murder of six million
European Jews, 'men quoted
Hegel. Men who redefined mo-
rality in their own terms picked
up what Hegel. knowingly, had
contributed; they appealed to
his belief in the inevitable
triumph of the human spirit to
justify the worst crimes against
the human spirit our world has
ever seen. Yet, if we believe in
the existence of the Juden-
Christian God, Dr, Rubenstein
tells us we must make that God,
the God who commands men to
love even their enemies, the
author of such an act!

of course Dr. Rubenstein as-
serts that such a God is dead,
Where is his evidence? To ob
serve that the JudeoChristian
God has met the needs of a cul
ture does not prove that such a
God is a product of that cul-
ture’s imagination, dreamed up
to meet those needs. The truth
that a religion interacts with the
others aspects of a culture es-
tablishes nothing about the
truth or falsity of that religion.
And even if it could be estab-
lished that many people
“create" a God to satisfy their
need lor a paternal figure,
what would it provel People
can believe in the right things
for the wrong reasons. (If a
man becomes an imperialist be-
cause he had a domineering
father, that is, for a reason
which has nothing to do with
national pride, it does not fol-
low that imperialism is a fig-
ment of human imagination.)
Such wishfulfillrnent reasoning
can explain anything away.

Perhaps Dr. Rubenstcin docs
not leel his arguments need any
rational justification. He offers
us instead his “gut-level" re
actions to life. But how reliable
are these? Are we to decide on
the basis of a little boy's fear of
death that there is no afterlife?
Or are we to conclude that the
Judeo»Christian God is dead and
earth is the “cannibal mother”
because a Jewish grandmother
has Palestinian dirt sprinkled
over her coffin? Each person’s
“gut-reactions” are different
from everyone else‘s; Dr. Rub-
enstein might well have cited
“gut-reactions" of joy and hope.

Dr. Rubenstein’s assertion that
for him the death of God was

tragic is very puzzling. He seems
to give up the Judso—Christian
God with enormous ease; in»
deed, he seems only too happy
to shake Him off and embrace
a “tragic pessimism." Students
who are considering adopting
the death of God position might
well ask if the issue is not so
terribly important as to require
the most serious kind of thought
and then they would do well to
demand better credentials for
that position than Dr. Ruben-
stein has to offer.

Condemns Senate Action
To the Editor:

The student Senate’s action
to observe the Moratorium
through the suspension of
classes and other campus activi»
ties is another example of the
efforts of the thoughtless few
in power to abuse the rights of
the powerless majority — a
tactic widely used in American
Politics.

This action has angered a
great many students and has
alienated a once sympathetic
student body from any meaning-
iul support of the activities this
thirteenth and fourteenth of
November. ,

What need is there"for the
suspension of cla es and regu-
lar campus activ es’! Possibly,
if students still have to get up
for their morning classes, they
can then find the impetus ne-
cessary to participate in the
Moratorium,

Midnight Cowboy: “A liberal Film"

By Alan G. Nasser
instructor of Philosophy

British director John Schlesinger (Dar-
ling, Billy Liar, a Kind of Loving) has
serious reservations about the quality
of American life and culture. These re-
servations are depicted in Midnight Cow-
boy with a cinematic vlrtilosity that
dazzles the visual sensibilities. This film
must be seen by all who understand and
appreciate the cinema for what it is.
namely, the richest and most exciting
art form of our time. But this is not to
say that Midnight Cowboy is first rate
cinema. it isn’t. For olle must distin-
guish its philosophical basis from its
execution. 1 shall argue that although
the latter is often admirably skillful,
the former accounts for the film's ul-
timate failure, But first, a brief synopr
sis of the scenario.

Joe Buck (get it?), a naive young Tex-
an dishwasher, decides to break out of
the hopeless monotony of small-town
Texas life to seek the Holy Grail of ex-
citement and fulfillment in the dream
capital of the U. A., New York City.
He boards a bus and travels to the
east coast confident that the pleasures
of the Good Life can be secured with
the money he will earn as the finest
stud east of the Mississippi. After all,
he has a certain undisputable charm,
he is handsome, and what is most im-
portant, he is a terrific lay. Surely
those wealthy New York women would
gladly pay luxury wages for a piece of
Joe's action.

Accoutred in an outlandish cowboy
outfit, he walks the streets of the city
in search of his first customer. After an
unsuccessful attempt or two, Joe picks
up an aging hooker who, after they “do
it" (as one says here in Iowa), re-
sponds so pathetically to Joe’s request
for payment, that he gives her twenty
dollars. Things are not at all going as
Joe had planned. He is soon broke, and
forced to sell his services to a pimply
young homosexual in the balcony of a
Times Square movie theater. Then he
meets “Ratso” Rizzo, a limping, sick-
ly slumdweller who, though unemployed,
manages to eke out a living among a
circle of pimps, whores, queers, trans-
vestites, and doperpushers.

The initial experience with Ratso is
discouraging, Conman that he is, he sells
Joe an appointment with what he as
sures him is a promising ”customer”,
but who turns out to be a religious
zealot of lunatic dimenswns. Of course,
Ratso has in the meantime split.

While aimlessly wondering the streets,
Joe spies Ratso in a diner, and ap-
proaches him with anger and resent-
ment. But the two need one another, and
a deep friendship begins. Joe moves
in with Ratso and continues his doomed
search for the mythical crotch market.
Meanwhile, the two cannot muster the
means to eat, and Ratso's respiratory
condition is growing steadily worse. Joe
finally realizes, after a spectacular night
with a swinger he meets at a hippie
party, that he will never find whatever
he is looking for in New York City. There
remains only one genuinely meaningful
altemative for Joe: perhaps he can real—
ize for the now critically ailing Ratso
the latter’s principal fantasy, to absorb
the solar. sexual, and culinary hedons of
Miami Beach. Joe's own dream has
proved to be an illusion, but Ratso's
can yet be made real. But first Joe must
get the busfare.

in an exceedingly brutal scene, .ioe
acquires the money from a whining,
middle-aged, corporate homosexual. He
boards the bus with a coughing, fever-
ridden Ratso, and they begin their jour-
ney to the eschaton, as the film moves
inexorably toward its tragic conclusion.

There is much that is commendable in
this film, it is a polished production
whose professionalism ensures that is
is unflaggingly entertaining. In fact. it
would not be unfair to describe Mid-
night Cowboy as a slick film, perhaps
too slick in its opportunistic use oi, for
example, fast cutting to insure that the
film is paced with sufficient rapidity
to make boredom Virtually imposs. 12
The film is bound to succeed as ente
tainment, for it successfully adjusts
self to the best of tried and tested avant~
garde tcchniques. And yet, ior those oi
us who make a steady Visual diet of
first rate cinema, this filln is routine.
For it is one thing for a filmmaker to
competently employ sophisticated tech-
niques that have been put to far better
use by his predecessors, and it is quite
another thing for a director to make
innovative use oi techniques suggested
by others of comparable statute. Each
involves the competent employment or
interesting and aesthetically mature
techniques, but it is only the latter that
signifies the work of a truly creative
filmmaker. There is nothing innovative
about Schlesinger's film. It’s all been
done before, and better.

Nonetheless, Schlesinger‘s technical
sophistication is praiseworthy, especially
in the light of a comparison of Midnight
Cowboy with the thoroughly mediocre
Good-bye Columbus. Larry Peerce’s film
is superficially ilashy; its beauty is only
skin deep, a typical response to the cur
rent middle class cultural revolution.
The new educated middle class wants
class in its films, and Hollywood is ac-
commodatirlg. ”if dey want film dat got
class, films with an avante-garde, Eu-
ropean complexion, dat's what we'll
give ’em!" Hence, Good-bye Columbus,
Secret Ceremony, Whining, Reflections
in a Golden Eye, etc. Pudovkin em-
ployed linkage editing with enormous
effectiveness; Good-bye Columbus is re-
plete with linkages. Eisenstein induces

visual orgasms with a masterful use of
collision Cutting; Goodbye Columbus is
full of collision cuts. Hitchcock knows
prcc'sely when to get the most out of
an eccentric camera angle; Goodbye
Columbus is a collage of crazy camera
angles. Not to mention at least two
zooms in every scene and all sorts of
distortion producing lenses. But none of
it works, because these techniques were
never conceived with a sense of contex-
tual function. The techniques preceded
the conception of the film. It’s compara-
ble to how I used to complete homework
assignments in high school. Teacher said
to wr:te a poem with a metaphor in it.
So i dreamed up a metaphor out of the
blue, and hastily constructed a piece of
(loggerel around it. My poetry Stank, but
Father Aquinas loved it.

Now Midnight Cowboy is not like
Goodbye, Columbus. If. is not merely a
bag of tricks. Schlesinger's use of tested
techniques is always a natural and [liner
tioning outgrowth of his overall concep-
tion of the film coupled with a clear
sense of what he wants to do with a par-
ticular scene or shot Within the film. And
this is no meager achievement.

Moreover, Schlesinger has the age of
his aesthetics. Think of Wild In the
Streets, a putatively “hip” iilm about
the gcncration gap. But the generation
gap, as one critic so astutely put it, was
within the film, which was cinematically
primitive. Worse yet, remember The
Night They Raided Minskry’s? A Nelson
Eddy-Jeanette MacDonald musical with
mid 60’s production. Trash.

And there is a pleasing sense of land
scape to this film, reminiscent of nut]
and Easy Rider. Schlesinger wants to
give us a sense of America, its values,
its cultural complexion, and, in a sense
which I shall severely qualify present-
ly, lic succeeds rather nicely. One as-
pect of the country is seen through
Joe’s eyes during his bus trip. Dustin
Hoffman as Ratso uses his own voice

Dustin Hoffman (left) as Ratso Rizzo, and Jon Voight as Joe Buck, as they appear
in “Midnight Cowboy.“ The film was directed by John Schlesinger.

for a landscape of New York City. And
Joe's portable radio, his vade mecum,
addressing itself to the empty air of his
hotel room, performs the same funo
tionr

Dustin Hoffman and John Voight der
liver two of the most stunning performr
ances or recent years, They work brilr
liantly together, and the individual per-
formances are literally flawless, There
is also a feeling of improvisational free»
dom that is rare in a film of this kind.
Schlesinger worked hard to induce this

spontaneity in Hoffman and Voight. In-
stead of making the film from a com-
pleted script, he used the first draft of
the script as a springboard, encouraging
the actors to take off from the script as
a base, and when they were able to
improve upon its details, it was re-writr
ten as a result and the scenes in ques
tion were shot again, In this sense, the
making of the film contributed to the
making of the film. This is commonplace
in superior European iilms, but it is
largely unheard of among even the best
American directors. Alfred Hitchcock,
for example, would never dream of such
a thing.

in order to understand why, in spite
of all this, the film fails, it is necessary
to inquire as to the director‘s purpose
in making Midnight Cowboy. By Schle-
singer’s own admission, he wanted to
depict “how. in America, the odds are
so great against a man‘s fulfilling him-
self—greater than in any other country.
It is so easy to be deceived in this
country. You Americans are so busy
deceiving yourselves." i-ie is referring
primarily to being deceived concerning
values. Whenever he travels to the Unit-
ed States, Schlesinger claims, he is in-
creasingly stricken by the way in which
Americans are bombarded from all di-
rections—signs, posters, all sorts of ad
ver‘tisements, radio and TV commercials,
films~with messages and propaganda
that cultivate in even the best of us a
whole network of false values, hopes,
aspirations and needs. The least harmful
are those lies such as "Eat here for the
biggest hamburger in the world,” or
“The world’s best coffee.” But the more
serious of these, that would have us
form images of ourselves extracted from
the decadent culture of a sexual lump-
enproletariat (Does not Playboy seek to
cultivate just such an image in the
minds of its readers?), produces charac-
ters like Joe Buck. Joe's conception of
himself, his sense of what a place like
New York has to offer (Read the sub-
way posters and the magazine ads:
“New York is Fun City!”7which it
most certainly is not), and his conception
of what he can make of his life in New
York City. are all learned. They are
learned from his environment. And
Schlesinger insists that everything in
Joe’s environment both suggests and en-
courages the ultimately destructive set
of hopes and aspirations that make
Joe Buck tick.

No one would deny that all this is true
as far as it goes. But it does not go
very far. In fact, in the absence of any-
thing more substantial in the way of so-
Clo-cultural insight, it is a superficial,
commonplace, and uninformative des~
Cription of the ills of America. What is
most important to see about Midnight
Cowboy is that there is a reason for
its social and moral fatuousness, And
in this reason lies the fatal flaw of the
film. You see, its viewpoint is entirely
inadequate, given Schlesinger’s aims and
objectives, which are to express, by
means of the visual aesthetics of the
cinema, the effects of certain aspects of
American culture upon its victims, and
the responses of the latter to their exist-
cntial predicament. The inadequacy oi

 

Friday, November l4, i969

the film’s viewpoint lies in the
tact that it is taken from the
very culture that it is critically
examining. Schlesinger shares
Virtually all of the basic as
sumptions and values that de~
fine the middle class culture
whose dynamics he so severely
Criticizes. Because of the cru
cial and central concessions
that Schlesinger makes to m'
clle class ideology, he is in-
capable in principle of accom»
plishing what he tries so hard
to accomplish. Let me be more
specific.

Midnight Cowboy is essential-
ly a liberal film, It sees its
world through the spectacles of
a liberal social worker, with all
the values oi Anglosdxon ra~
tionalism and purltanism that
go along with this way of per-
ceiving the world, There is a
need to explain everything.
Joe's proclivities are explained
in a series at unnecessary and
aesthetically oltensive flash»
backs, showing no one ever paid
any attention to him as a
Child, how his mother and
grandmother always had other
people around, people who dis-
tracted them from giving little
Joey the attention and affection
that every little Texan needs.
With this piece oi pseudorpsy.
choanalysis, we now know why
Joe really embarks upon his
quest. His aspirations make
sense now in a way in which
they would not have made sense
had we not been told of his boy-
hood traumas. But all this is
quite unnecessary. Having as

we do a much proiounder grasp
at what makes American Cul-
ture work than does the liberal
caseworker. we understand pep
fectly well why Joe should in
vest his ego in these glittering
illusions. Given the values that
have permeated our environ-
ments since our childhood days,
it is neither unnatural nor in
need of special explanation why
Joe does what he does.

The kind of rationalism to
which I am objecting goes
hand in hand with a certain sort
of value judgment that is as-
sociated With buritanism. Thus,
we are offered, implicitly or
explicitly, normative explana-
tions of homosexuality, sexual
promiscuity, and kindred phe-
nomena. How artificial and re
moved from reality Midnight
Cowboy seems compared even
to certain secondrrate European
films, in which for example, he-
mosexuality is simply accepted
as one of the bases of the film,

The clearest and most strik-
ing examples of the kind of
thing I am trying to call your
attention to is the sweetness and
softness and sentimentality that
underlies most of the dialogue.
subliminally voicing the cen-
tral assumptions of the liberal
caricature of humanitarianism
that defines American attempts
to deal with social problems.
There are really no nasty char-
acters in this lilm. indeed, the
central message oi Midnight
Cowboy is that basically all of
us are alike; we are lonely, pa-
thetic, and in need of love: El-

common goals and aspirations;
it only we could set aside our
piddling diiiereiices and pursue
what we share in common (cf,
the letter of Miss Miriam Smith
in a recent issue of the S 8: 3).
Thank God that some of us see
through the sham of this ruling
class propaganda. it is the sale
ient feature of the contemporary
world that many of us adhere
to values that are fundamentally
incompatible with those oi the
liberal establishment. This
very fact by itseli illuminates
a great number of social, polit-
ical, and economic phenomena
that are unintelligible apart
from it. To insist that brother
ll. Rap Brown and mother Dean
Rusk really share the same as
pirations deep down is to throw
into hopeless confusion one's en-
tire conception of the Black Li-
beration Movement. The same
point holds of a small but grow-
ing number of students and
their mentors, both faculty and
administrators. The WerAre-All-

ﬁts and protects the ruling class
and the ruling class alone, by
sapping the disenfranchised of

action lies the acquistion of

power. For it is by power that
the ruling class rules. In this
sense, then, Midnight- Cowboy,
with its saccharine sentimentalr
ity and case worker approach,
is a covert piece of bougeois
ideology.

This liberal bias also inter»

Movie Preview:

The Shop on

By Jon Stein

This weekend's movie will be
”The Shop On Main Street." It
will be shown at 8:00 Saturday
and Sunday nights in ARH.

”The Sleeping Car Murder,"
previously scheduled for Friday
and Saturday nights, has been
canceled so that the Friday
night showing would not conﬂict
with Moratorium activities.
Because of the state of my
budget, I decided not to Show
the movie at all this week and
hope to bring it when more
students will have an op-
portunity to see it.

One of the most widely ac-
claimed films of recent years,
“The Shop On Main Street" is
the tragicomedy of two people
in Czechoslovakia during the
early days of World War II.
One is a simple good natured
carpenter who has been “Aryan
controller" (the term ”Aryan”
was used by the Nazis to signity
non~jewish descent) of a sup~
posedly profitable Jewish
dryguods shop. The other
character is an elderly widowed
proprietor of the shop, a

complished cinematically. Note
the scene in which the bedridden
Ratsn tells Joe that he is no
longer able to walk. One has
the feeling throughout the pic-
ture, and especially in this
scene, that one is being manip-
ulated by the performers, rath-
er than being affected by them.
So, you see, bad politics means
bad art. There’s another motive
for the revolution.

Main Street

headstrong, but engaging old
woman obliVious to the war,
who cannot understand the
position of the new arrival.

Tragedy strikes when
Nazis give orders for the
deportation of all Jews. The
carpenter first risks his own life
by trying to hide the old
woman, then panics under the
excruciating conflicts of the
circumstances.

Totally without pretension,
and with two great performers
creating unforgettable por-
traits, it stands as one of the
finest films of our time.

Kleinschmldt also asserted
that “there is a possibility that
by successive endorsement of
suspension or elimination of our
activities we will not be serving
the purposes of the Moratorium
Committee or our own pur<
poses, but will rather be serv-
ing the purpose of another group
of people who would use the bas-
tion of this institution and
similar American institutions
as a base from which to destroy
those institutions."

"That sounds like Agnew’s
argument that protest en-
courages Hanoi," responded In-
structor Alan G. Nasser
(Philosophy). “It may be true,
but it doesn’t matter. That
argument is as weighty, no
more, no less, than Agnew's."

Associate Prof. Edward E.
Foster (English) expressed
agreement with Kleinschmidt.

"We would not want to use the
educational process as a lever
to eiiect political change, part-

icularly change that would desA
trcy that process," Foster said.

Associate Prol. Donald R,
Liggett (Education) suggested
that the college dismiss classes
one day each month ”to give
publicity and demonstrate how
strongly we feel" about ending
the War.

“I think this is an issue on
which we as a faculty should
take a political position,” Ligr
gett said.

“I think the townspeople
would be more impressed ii
students went out (to work
against the War) during their
leisure time." responded
Associate Prof. Karl DeLong
(Biology).

Asst. Prolr Neal A. Milner
(Political Science) and {he
structor Gregory Guroll
(History) argued that faculty
members already have the
option to call classes without
penalty under the established
policy of "procedural
ﬂexibility."

Worley, however, said that
the special motion regarding
the Moratorium was necessary
to give students an option on
class attendance.

After the motion was ap
proved, Prol. Beth Noble
(Spanish) upbraided the
taculty:

“I find it increasingly difficult
to vote with this faculty. 1 no
longer know what this college
is. I have no idea 0! what the
nature of the liberal arts col-
lege is in respect to this in-
stitution, and l donut know what
the aims and goals of this
college are. It doesn't seem to
me that the college makes any
sense any more . Is the ad-
ministration, the trustees, or
the executive council going to
come out with a statement or
what we are and where we are
going, or doesn’t anybody
care?"

Last Saturday the Pioneer
gridmen finished their season
cn a victorious note, deieating
Lawrence 14-13. The victory
gave Grinnell a oz record for
the season and a tie for third
place in the conference, with
Lawrence and Cue.

The game was a contrast oi
styles, pitting Grinnell‘s passing
attack against the running at
Lawrence. The Pioneers were
able to complete 14 ol25 passes
tor 217 yards while gaining only
35 yards rushing, Meanwhile
Lawrence rolled up an impreSr
sive 313 yards rushing but was
not able to complete a pass,

Lawrence scored first on 21
threeyard run in the iirst
quarter. The touchdown capch
a sevenplay 52 yard march.
Grinnell came back later in the
iirst quarter with Gary Johnson
throwing a 4Eryard strike to Ed
Hirsch tor the score. The extra
point failed and Grinnell trailed
7'6.

In the second quarter the Flor
neers scored the go-ahead
touchdown on a Bayard pass
from Johnson to Jim Pirolli.
After the derense stopped
Lawrence on the one-yard line,
Grinnell drove 93 yards for the
score. Ed Hirsch grabbed
another Johnson pass for the
two-point conversion.
