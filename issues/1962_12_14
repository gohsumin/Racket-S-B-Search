To the Editor:

, Last week's letter from “A

l1 am sure, “not as fully-develop i
led proposals ready for immediatel
adoption, but as a basis for dis.
cussion of what We must all feel
are problems.” For although the
general ideas are very good, con»
siderable comment is called for.

This Concerned student cites
at length the case of a student
who received “A‘s" from an
outstanding high school, “700‘s"
on College Boards, and “D’s”
at Grinnell College. His con-
clusion is “that the professors
involvcd in such cases are

education to stimulate and v

Crinnell is acutely aware, as

amount of money in hopes of
receiving a first—rate liberal
arts education. For these rea-
sons I am certain that every i
Grinnell student would wel- :

portunity to evaluate courses
and teachers, as the Concerned .
student suggests, WITHOUT

now that not all stu—

ism would be sound,
that there would be unjustly
bitter students (like the one dis-,

letter) who would be unfair to
teachers, and a portion of the,
student body would not bother’

even if it were in favor of the
idea. HOWEVER, the Board of
Trustees, or some appropriate
non-faculty committee, would be-
able to separate the sound from
the unsound, the unbiased from
the sour-grapes, and, even with.
out total participation, the prev—
alent from the unusual criticism.
Furthermore, there would be
constructive criticism and praise
of both curriculum and faculty,,
for Grinncll students, in their
quest for a good education, will
be quick to encourage the good
aspects of the Grinnell education,
if they are given a chance.

To the end that the students
be given such a chance to help
make Grinnell's education a bet-,
tar one, I urgently implore all
these students to take to heart

Readers answer ‘C‘oncerned

To the Editor:

After having read the liter.
ary effort of “A Concerned
Student," (in the Dec. 7 soon),
we agree with that humanities
professor who said that he
“looks for too many angles."

1T 15 TRUE that nearly cv-
eryone has legitimate gripes
about “intro” courses and hu—
manities, or about a few pro-
fessors in his first two years.

lBut why condemn the whole
lfaculty to the ninth circle of

ban for the “sins” of a few
professors?

We also disagree with “Cou-
cernerl’s“ r e commendations.
We do not think that the stu-
dents in general—and “Con-
cerned" in particular are qual-
ified to determine such a
serious matter as a profes-
sor’s salary.

"Concerned" also asks that
professors “do research on their
ow n time." Each professor
teaches about three courses, for
which he must grade papers
and exams, prepare lectures or
at least guidelines for discus-
sion, and read every bit as
much as the students, simply
in the pmcess of teaching his
course,

Also, he will probably have
committee and faculty meets
ings, give extra lectures, and
have conferences or discus-
sions with students now
much time are professors ex—
pected to give us?

At the risk of being called
members of the “mutual ad-
miration society,” we would
like to suggest that “Concern-
ed” get off this griping kick
and help the President and pro-
fessors make Grinnell the out-
standing college it can be.

To the Editor:

In his recent statement re.

changed the student body with
the task of thoroughly and care-
fully examining their obliga-
tions to the Grinnell commun-
ity and to the “outside world”
beiore proposing any specific
changes in the college's social
regulations.

Dr. Bowen has opened himself
to a similar appeal, and i should
like to take this opportunity to
put forth such a challenge.

Speciﬁcally, I should like to

The regulation, as ii. now
stands, requires that a student
who receives money from the
college must repay his total

This regulation is clearly
indicative of the college’s lack

To the Editor:

1 wish to direct this letter to
the anonymous writer (in the

we evaluate the faculty. Granted,
he may have received the un—
fair treatment he complained of;
however, he has no right to
,condemn the whole faculty.

First of all, the teacher

should not have to spend his
time “challenging" students at
this point in their education.
This should have ended in
grade school. There is also i
something to he said for sound,

, mu ONLY possible justifica-
tion for Lhis regulation is that
the college desires to protect its
invesLment in the student on
scholarship. Yet what does this
argument amount to? The stu—
dent is to be regarded as a
financial investment, to be used
for the benefit of the college,
and jealously guarded against
‘the appealing aspects of other
schools.

I fail to see how any educa-
tional institution which operr
ates on this assumption can
possibly have the audacity to
call itself hoth liberal and
progressive.

I openly challenge any me
her of the faculty or admin -
tration to justify this regulation
to the student body, for i fall

deeply committed to the ed -
cation and preparation of thei -
dividual can possibly allow such
a rule to exist.

After dropping two away cone
tests, to Lawrence and Ripon,
,Knox drubbed both highly rated
iCoe and Beloit last weekend,

THE SIWASHEns rely main—
ly on a fast break, passing of-
fense, and employ a zone and

tense.

Grinnell coach John Pfitsch
expects to run up against a zone
defense tonight, since the Pin»
neers were unable to fathom
simIlar defenses used by Carle-
ton and Cornell.

PFITSCH FEELS that the
Knox game will be a real chal-
lenge. Having taken only one of
,the first four contests has led
to a morale problem on the team,
and a victory now is necessary
if the boys are to snap out of it

He said the squad recognizes
the “need to come back", and
declares “We’re not throwing
in the sponge. People will
know about us before welre
through this year."

Following the game tonight
the team WIIl get a short vaca—

part in a holiday tournament to
be held in Grinnell December
23 29 The Pioneers won the
tournament last year, beating out
’Knox, Chicago, and Colorado
College, who are also this years
entrants.

On January 3 the Pioneers

,will play at Beloit.
