. Guerilla Group Raises
' Registration Questions

Iy LEE MAIIL

Guen‘ﬂe die-aver Qontlmlej to grow
end it doesn't matter that they're not the
San Francisco mime troop. whet does
matter is that people, students, have
formed the beginning: at a group, that
talks and listens to each other in spite of
tho luck of endemic credit, computer
curds, Kumlsed instructions . .their
massage remains general, their goals
ltlll obscure, but it really doesn't mat»

Z ter. They made us think, they made a
joke out or registration, they made us
realize that the only ones who should
take registration seriously are the
clerks, secretaries, and the computer.

“it's nice to see everyone. Here have
some mace. Get your brains here only
3100 dollars. All you have to do is plug
it ln—go to school »- go to school go to

At first sullen seniors full of a week's
studying for comps, worried about their
last oral, thinking about the world out
side Grinnell, pale
faces, girls that lound
themselves crying tor
no reason at all, Christ~
mas somehow isn't what it used to be,
even the mystical magic of sounds and
sights somehow suppressed by grad
school applications, Peace Corps, Vista,
army, and the alternatives seem to be-
come minimized as time runs out. . .
they don't even want to talk about it.
And so they look sadly, it at all, at the
painted clowns with hairy legs and when
the grim reaper hands them a diploma
its not really so tunny, not really so
tunny at all. Four years at Grinnell,
eight registrations, this is the last, and
shades ot the tirst year standing out-
side Darby, some staying all night, you
don't ever forget

And so it’s sounds go away, you're
not funny, Grinnell isn't so bad because
if it. were, I wouldn’t have stayed here
so long. . .but the grim reaper’s plastic
scowl doesn't flinch and staring at him,
even at eight o'clock in the morning, is
something you can't laugh off. The sen-
ior-s didn’t laugh at all,

The morning dragged on and guerilla
theater got better as their voices
warmed up, their bodies moved more
naturally, and the monotonous voice of
the brainseller drilled into faces which

It's easier to go lltmg with the joke, the
time in line goes lust, and the cold air
is retreshing when its all over.

The younger you are, the bigger the
joke. Freshmen stand Outside in the

pening inside. They don’t have to Stand
outside but they do anyway, its all part
of Standing in line, and you just follow

Grinnell College is so Simple.

at last everything has been said that

tlne of a warm library.

We aren’t here to stand in llne, nor to
sit in class and stare at the teacher, but
to realize what is happening to us and to
our lriends. The blurbing paragraphs in
the catalogue which are anxiously read
by high school seniors and somehow,
even though no one will admit it, hoped
and prayed tor by everyone here, remain
words, just words, which have as little
meaning as most oi the academic
courses. its not relevance I'm talking
about, though I think its important, but
something even more general, some
kind of education which allows you to
make your own mistakes tree or grade

From the Lenox Quartet to
Students, Faculty and Admin-
istration.

We wish to announce that
we have accepted an appoint—
ment as Quartet in Residence
at the State University of New
York at Binghamton effective
July, 1969.

Since 1962 we have been
Al‘tists-in—Residence at Grin-
nell College, The relationship
which We have had with the
College has been very gratify-
ing to us. The support and ap—
preciation to the college com-
munity has made our stay here
I very meaningful one It is in
this spirit of contentment and
because of the quality‘ of Grin-
nell College as a liberal arts in-
stitution, that we regret leav-
ing for this new nppointment.

-We simply hope that the Ar-

tists-in-Residence Program is

No. I!

an ideal which the College will
continue.

A major involvement at
SUNY Binghamton will be a
new graduate program in the
performance of chamber music
— the first program of its kind.
We will train string quartets
for careers in this profession.
We feel that this type of pro«
gram is vital to the develop
ment of chamber music in this
country. As in Grinnell we will
also presnet concerts, lecture
recitals. and private instruc-
tion.

Our experience at Grinnell
has been deeply fulfilling. We
will miss our friends Ind col-
leagues very much.

New Cache For Old Boolts

The student used book store has been
in operation tor three years, working as
a student service and making just about
no prorits (375 it loo or so extra books
last year). The store buys textbooks at
60% of cost and sells them at 70% of
Cost Also, at the end oi the year it
buys books from Seniors on a cash basis
at 40% 0t cost. The hours oi the used
book store, which is located in the
basement of the Fine Arts building, are
“sporadic", according to the manpower
that can be obtained. The useil book
store will continue in operation “as long
as students are selling or buying books
. . .or until the theatre department
throws us out",

One at the problems of the used book
store is space and location. “Due to an
expanding volume oi texts" more room
is needed. Also, Tom Thomas, SGA

president, would like to see the store
expand into being more than simply a
temporary thing, limited only to text-
books. This would mean having the
store open. “say, on Monday and Wed-
nesday nights Irom seven to nine"
year-round, sewing not just as a used
book exchange but also as a place tor
records, posters, paper, and new books
to be bought and sold at lower prices
than those found in the book store or on
the open market, It would thus provide
competition with the book store, leading
to possible lowering ot prices time.

it a more central and spacious loca-
tion could be found. it more manpower
could be obtained and it more capital
would be made available, the used book
store could “begin year-round opera-
tion as a useful service to the student
body".

EDITORIALS,-

A New Policy

Grinnell College is located
in a town which is often con-
sidered isolated. In my opinion
it is very much in the main
stream of events. It, along with
many institutions in this soci-
ety, is undergoing V a r i o u 5
changes as the goals and inter-
ests of the college community
and the society change. This is
my attitude towards the Grin—
nell situation and is the basis
for my editorial policy. As edi-
tor, I would like to make the
newspaper an example of this
attitude. The paper will focus
on the goals and interests of
the “community.”

The Scarlet and Black will
attempt to represent and chal-
lenge the situation by being
concerned with those issues
and events which are import-
ant to the variety of people at
Grinnell. This shall include
concerns directly related to the
educational situation and to the
greater society of which we are
a part, even if it is in sheltered
Grinnell College, Grinnell,
Iowa.

Some new features are being
introduced to the paper in or-
der to fulfill this hopeful role.
First, the management of the
newspaper will be extended to
include an editorial board and
a research editor. In order to
become more aware and re-
sponsive to the variety of issues
and people that exist at Grin-
nell, the editorial board will
meet weekly to give direction
to the paper’s concerns. A spe-
cial research editor will be
working to provide well ex-
plored, in-depth articles and
surveys. In addition, there will
be several regular columns.
Social and political problems
will be covered in a “Revolu»
tion" column and a series of
draft articles. Our immediate
situation will be covered in a
guide to the town of Grinnell,
“the talk of the town," and a
second column of commentary
on Grinnell College. Feature
articles will appear as often as
possible raising other valid is-
sues. Hopefully faculty and ad-
ministrators will freely partic-
ipate along with students. The
goal is primarily communica»
tion, through the presentation
of ideas and the facts of events
which are of concern to the
college community.

“We Won’t Go . ..”

As editor of the Scarlet and
Black, I have signed the 1968-
1969 version of the US. Na
tional Student Association “We
Won’t Go” statement for stu-
dent hody presidents and edi-
tors. After fighting through
other channels to change the
course of America’s foreign
policy and to remove the in-
equities of the draft system, the
problem still remains. Left
without alternatives the state-
ment concludes,

“Along with thousands of
our fellow students, we campus
leaders cannot participate in a
war which we believe to be
immoral and unjust. Although
this, for each of us, is an in—
tensely personal decision, we
publicly and collectively ex-
press our intention to refuse
induction and to aid and sup-
port those who decide to refuse.
We will not serve in the mili-
tary as long as the war in Viet-
nam continues.”

Although our newly elected
President pledged, “to conse-
crate my office, my energies,
and all of the wisdom I can
summon to the cause of peace
among nations,” I’m afraid this
statement is still necessary.
Although the statement is not
appropriate to my position, I
give it my full support as editor
of the 5&3. After serious con—
sideration I have concluded
that this statement represents
my feelings and the actions I
would take if I were in the
position of a draft age, Amer-
ican male. Although this will
not effectively change the situ~
ation, the consideration and
commitment involved in voic-
ing this objection is important.
I hope I am representing the
other students on the Grinnell
campus.

Comps Questioned

To the Editor:

Having just taken a, comprehensive
examination and a GRE, I ohjectl
These examinations in History were not
unfairly difﬁcult, but they were not
fairly justified. For one, I learned noth-
ing new. It would seem to me that in
any educational system, an examination
could support itself only on the grounds
that it challenged and helped synthe-
size previous learning. It should be only
a learning experience. However, the
comprehensive, and especially the Grad-
uate Record, only tested tor a required,
quantitative knowledge or [our years of
study. i did not come out of the test
satisfied that I had Either discovered
new understanding or better completed
the unity or my major field. I had only
regurgitated a few dim memories
brought to life by some spotty revrew he
tore the test.

Secondly, it the comprehensives' pur-
pose is relegated to the state oi “judg~
ing” the value oi human students, (as
linals so often do) why is it necessary?
Our computerized transcripts already
have our value divided and subdivided
into numerical standards. why is the
Student intimidated once more With a
grade? Graduate schools don't require
such information. An excellent pass on a
comprehensive does not raise a student
item the bottom ten percent of his class.
It would only mean that for once, he
had gained some correct (acts. No rests
could really cover every dinerem per-
son’s academic progress over four
years.

Finally, I don‘t understand why my
scheduled graduation must be jeopar-
dized by a possible failure in a Compre-
hensive. I would suppose every course
next semester is also a threat to such
graduation, but not extraordinarily so.
Each course is part of a normal study
load. However, my lwo spring compre—
hensives are the equivalant of two extra
term papers for the semester. In my
Case, that means I will have six or seven
term papers [0 write. it seems almost
perverse to be allowed this near to
graduation, and then more severely scru»
tinized than in any other semester at
Grinnell. Furthermore. a second semes—

We are sorry we were unable to
publish it earlier.)

Dear Sirs:

The Students for Violent Non-Action
(SVNA) is planning a massive demons
stration in protest of the existence of
the new administration. On January 20,
1969, as Nixon says the last word or the
lnaugural oath t“. . . so help me God"),
we plan to have every toilet in the
country flushed.

We realize of course that we may not
be able to reach every toilet, but we
hope that, with the cooperation at or-
ganizations such as yours, we Shall be
able to reach a large majority of them.
We are attempting to enlist the aid at
students at every college'and university
in the nation as well as everyone else
who wishes to join. The protest will re—
quire a high degree of organizational
wort as we hope to ﬂush lhe toilets
not only of the dorms, apartments, and
lecture halls in and around campuses.
but also downtown hotels, restaurants,
railroad stations, and high schools, pri-
vate homes, etc. Posters will be avail-
able at cost to aid in advertising from
the SVNA. ,

If you are interested in lending sup-
port please write to:

Occult-Characterizes Exhibition

By RICHARD WICHSTROM

The paintings and drawings of Rut
lilanrhom, American painter, John :1.
Graham an exhibit at Schaeiter gallery
through February ii, presents a com-
prehensive sample of the late work of
this important ﬁgure in American art.
He studied law in Russia and emigrated
to the United States in the mid»20's
where, for the first time, he began to
study art. During the 30‘s Graham
painted in a style similar to the post-
Cubistic style at Picasso. Through this
early work, he formed a major link be-
tween the developments in European
and American art.

Blessed with an eye for beauty, he
was a connoisseur of African, Egyptian,
and Italian Renaissance an. Unlike
most American artists, Graham was
able to paint with complete understand-
ing at the European postsCubislic style.
In the mid-30’s he was 8 close friend of
the then unknown artists, Gorky, Pol-
lock, deKnnning, and David Smith,
among others.

In the 40's he discarded his Picasso-
like style, and wmlred along stylistic
lines closely related to the work of UC»
cello and Greek ciassicismr It. is work
from this period which is presented.

This work is consciously prim ive.
The ﬂatly modeled iigures exhibit an
interplay of large, abstract concave and
convex terms and crisp, sweeping line,
which link it tn the 20th Century Per-
haps the most. obvious stylistic trait

is his use a! crossed and distorted eyes
They are ﬁxed in a haunting stare for
the double purpose of anchoring space
to a point in the room and or creating
tension.

It is this tension which forcefully com-
pliments his preoccupation with the
mysticr These wurks are rich in occult
iconography, most of which is far over
my head. For example in Head or a
Woman, 1954 the pupil at the lett eye
is larger than the right. In the sym-
bolism of the occult this is a sign of a
rapid spiritual growth, His many selt.
porti-nits are rich in iconography.
Graham claims that his work was not
intended to be beautiful but to convey
iniorrnation about the occult, recogniz-
able only to a iew.

Art News, October, 1960, in a review
at his works claims, “The ceremony he
believes in, is, like Hundirli’s, relegated
to the vaudeville stage. Far today magic
is disappointing in its triviality and in-
consequentiality." i couldn't disagree
more strongly with this dismissal of
Graham's work and the occult. Explor-
ntion into the unknown order at this
world has been made in the last few
decades in the fine arts, tar example,
the music or John Cage, chance draw~
ings of A11), etc. The Western culture
has been blind too long to this aspect
of “reality,"

1 tind the work or Graham challeng-
ing, stimulating, and haunting in my
opinion it's one of the better exhibitions
presented this year.
