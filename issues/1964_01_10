Grinnell Political Convention Offers
Opportunity for Student Delegates -

Work has already begun in
preparation for Grinnell’s sec-
ond Mock Political Convention
to be held April 9.11. Grinnell
students will soon have an op
portunity to sign up to partici—
pate as delegates in the 1964
convention.

Grinnell’s first Mock Political
Convention was held in 1960.
Senator Wayne Morris of Ore-
gon gavs the keynote address
in that inaugural convention.

The mock political conven~
tion in the Words of C. Edwin
Gilmour “attempts to replicate
yust as realistically as possible
the atmosphere and mechanics
of a national convention.

The keynoter for the 1964
convention will be Oregon
Governor Mark Hatﬁeld. A
Republican, the youthful ﬂat-
field is considered by many
to be one of the leading can-
didates for the Vice Presiden-
tial nomination.

Gilmour describes the mock
convention as “fun with a pur-
pose." In the 1960 convention
ambitious Rockefeller support-
ers imported an elephant from

Grinnell Gets Gobs of $

Grinnell has received a giii
in kind from the Dow Chemical
Company, valued at in excess of
$5,600. -
Merritt C. Ludwig, vicc presi-
dent, said the Dow materials
are being used in construction
of the Gl‘innell College Forum,
the new student center which is
scheduled for completion next
fall. r

 

a Davenport zoo for the conven-
tion.

The real interest in the con-
vention, however, will center on
the nominah'ons. The Republi—
cans can offer What appears to
be shaping up as a uniquely in-
teresting contest with at least
six strong/contenders and sev-
eral possible dark horses con-
tending for the Presidential
nomination.

At present there appears to
be no Challenger to Lyndon
Johnson for the Democratic
nomination, but the vice presi-
dential nomination r e m a i n 5
very much a question mark.

The goal of the convention
is to have every Grinnell stu-
dent participate as a dele-
gate. priority will be given
to those who are members of
either the Young Democrats
or Young Republicans.

The convention will be thrown
open to participation for Stu-
dents from all lowa colleges so
the importance of an early sign
up for Grinnell students is em-
phasized.

' Jay Bardole Bescribes African Student life A

The tribal people seem to be friendly to the
foreigner. As a friend and I entered one of the na-
tive villages which was about two hours walk from
Cuttington. the people came out and shook our
hands and. we made a _vain attempt at conversa-
tion. .

We can really divide our students at Cuttington
into three groups. First, there are the Monrovia
’etudents. generally classed as Americo Liberian
These young people are said to be descendents of
former slaves, and it was their folk who ran the
country before the Tubman administration. This
term is no longer admired and is embarrassing to
those whom it describes. These students have al-
ways lived in a Western atmosphere, speak no tri-
bal tongue, and the folk lore is unknown to them. In
many ways they resemble American Negroes.

We have many tribal students who were and
are educated by various missions. These students
have all attended bush school, and know the' arts
and skills taught there. Both boys and girls have
experienced the ritual ceremony of circumcision.
.When they go home for vacation, they return to

. mud huts, and to families who may speak little or
no English. These students are steeped in native
folk lore and other tribal customs having been
taught by the bush devil himself.

Many of these tribal students strive for an edu-
cation so they can return to their villages and raise
the standard of living. A few want to leave their
homeland and its poverty and find the excitement
and high standard of living of the Western world.
but fortunately they are a minority.

As every school. Cuttington has its foreign stu—
dents. We have Kikuyu students from Kenya, one of
whom has served five years in a Mau~Mau deten-
tion camp. Most of the students come from colonial

countries, such as Kenya, Nigeria, Sierra Leone.
Rhodesia and Swayland, and they feel hostile to-
ward foreigners ln Africa. These are the students
who are likely to be rebellious and lead student
strikes, etc. Still they do lend a greater variety to
the African scene at Cuttington, providing a wealth
of thought that students should imbibe.

Yes, I can now say I have taught a Prince. We
have two Princes, one from Nigeria, and from the
Cameroon. The latter, in particular is as courtly
and courteous as a prince ought to be, and he is a
fine addition to my track team.

The students‘ attitude toward the United States
is constantlychanging. They feel that our policies
are hypocritical. They ask why we send Peace
Corps to Africa when we need help in our own
South. When a distinguished man like William 0.
Douglas, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court,
comes to Cuttington and tells the students that there
is no real racial problem in the United States, and
that which remains is rapidly vanishing, the stu-
dents know he is whitewashing the truth. This does
not build good will. '

Likewise the students’ feeling towards me fluc-
tuates according to the New York Times report on
the racial problem. When Birmingham is in the
news, I can anticipate their reaction. But usually
they are gay and friendly. ,

The students are basically argumentative. Each
paper or exam returned that isn’t graded as high as
the student is used to will bring that student for—
ward, not so much asking way, but complaining
that he should have more credit. ,Grades are the
prime goal of all these students. Many times talk
becomes quite heated, but usually the next day
there are few hard feelings.

It is more difficult to gain a rapport with these

 

 

students than it is for a’teacher at home. I have
found that I have gained much of an insight wlm
the track. team as we prepared for the meet. and
now can exchange ideas with these students much
better. My best rapport has come through my
square dance group. These students feel die most
ease with me, and I feel the most at ease with them.

Students here are serious about their studies.‘
and work long hours in preparation, but their ef-
ficiency is low. Reading rates are slow and they
have not mastered the art of selecting material
that is important. Their mode of study is memoriza-
tion, and they try to memorize everything. The cry
in class is give us a definition, their purpose being
to have something to memorize. They memorize
specific examples; however, seldom can they trans-
fer the methods to similar problems. Calculus stu-
dents can work a complex integration if it is pre-
sented in a straightforward form, but if it is a word
problem, they can not set the problem up. As for
anything requiring the logic of Western thought—
well, African thought patterns just aren‘t logical.

Many of the problems stem from the fact that
75 per cent of the students are working in a second
language. Also the students enter college with a
poor background. Thus education for Liberia on the
primary and secondary levels as well as in col-
leges is important, and it must be obtained if the
students are going to successfully maintain a posi<
tion in the world today. The problem is: how best
can Western methods and African personality be
integrated.

from Travel-Scholar Jay Bardoie, who is
presently teaching at Cuttington College, Li-
beria. -

A recent $4,500 grant from
the Maurice and Laura Falk
Foundation is being used to un~
derwrite the new internship
program for the next three
years.

These internships are in addi~

Explore'Purposes of Interim Session

By Karen Adkinson

The end of exams, a week
from next Tuesday, signals the
beginning of the interim period,
a recent innovation at Grinnell.

The interim was one of the

results of a comprehensive cur-
riculum study by the faculty
several years ago. This study
produced not only the germ of
the present JLA system, but
also, in an unrelated sugges
tion, the concept of a reading
period. The system as it: now
stands came out of long dis-
cussions by the entire faculty

as well as work by several
committees and the Executive
Council. ,

Waldo Walker, ‘associate
dean, who is in charge of the
.lnterim program, commented
“The faculty felt that it was
fairly important that students
do something for themselves
with time freed from the regi-
mentatlon or classes. During
this free time, it was felt, stu-
dents might explore aspects
of education which could not
be explored through class-
work. The timing of the inter-
im session reveals its non-

course orientation, 5 i n o e
some schools place their
reading p e r I o d s before
exams."

The interim this year will
feature Kenneth Burke, noted
literary critic, and Dr. Norwood
Russell Hansen of Yale, as well
as Rosenfield lecturer, Stanley
Hoffmann,

Walker noted, “The featured
lecturers were chosen from
speakers whom we had heard
were effective on other college
campuses.

Because of the tire hazard

of this program. The fresh-

their lecture series. The JLK
should not be casting a black
shadow over the interim,"
said Walker.

He continued. "Last year’-
reading period was successful,
gauged by the attendance at
lectures, Instead of falling off
it actually increased, especially
in the case of Rapeport. De-
spite the length of free time
there was a heavy majority of
students remaining on campus
for the entire period. On the
whole, the faculty felt the time
was a success."

little guard, hung onto his Mide
west Conference scoring lead
85 he led his Vikings to a two‘
game roadsweep last weekend.
the first road wins for Law-
rence in three seasons.

Making the biggest jump in

'ihe individual department was
Cornell’s Dick Calbow, who
vaulted from 13th spot before
the holiday break to third place
this w e e k, mainly on the
strength of a 36 point perform-
ance against Monmouth, the

’league high for the year.

Busiest teams of the week
will be Carleton and St. Olaf.
Each has three games, starting
eon Tuesday when they tangle
with each other on the Olca‘
home court.

On the weekend, these two
play host to Cornell and Grin-
nell. the second and third place
teams in the loop. Cornell goes
to St. Olaf and Grinnell to Car-
leton on Friday. It is change
partners on Saturday afternoon.

Cornell’s vaunted offense is
back on the track now after
stuttering during the holiday
recess. It features the deadly
shooting of Jack Grams and the
all-around play of Calbow. Dal
Zierk, a starting guard, should
be back after undergomg minor
surgery.

Grinnell has three of the top
scorers in the league ~ Jim
leflin, Gordon Klnkead, and
Jeff Frantz ~ and the leading
rebounder in John Sllndell, who

has plucked off over 20 stray ‘
shots a game, and |S currently:

fourth in that department in the
nation.

team in the league right now,
gets its biggest test oi the year
Saturday when Ripon goes to
Appleton, Wis.

Tournament in Chicago. The
last minute victory in the finals
followed a semi-final, 68-61, win
over Colorado College.

Thanks, primarily, to superb
second half efforts in the
championship game by sopho-
more guard Gordy Kinkead, at
5’9”, the shortest man on the
court, and senior center John
Sundel‘l, at 6’7”, the tallest
player on ﬁle floor, the Pio-
neers were able to overtake
Knox for the first time with 1
min. 26 secs. left to play and
held on to cop the tournament
trophy.

Kinkead, scoring 19 a d e r
against Colorado the night be—
fore, tallied 16 big points in the

second half against the Siwash
to pull the Pioneers out of a
scoring drought that put them
nine points behind with less

All,

By Len Calodney

In setting up the experiment to test the benefit’of
face guards for 1M football helmets, two methods
might be tried. ,

First, two halls could be given the strings of hel-
mets with the guards to use throughout the season. In
this way it could be directly seen whether the face
guards caused a reduction in the number of facial in-
juries for that particular hall by comparing yearly fig-
ures. An immediate objection to this idea stems from
the number of head injuries reported each year. Since
there are an average of eleven injuries a season in this
area, or an average of about one per hall per year, the
fact that one hall may or may not get its quota can
not be significant on such a small number of cases.

The second possibility would be to use the two
strings of special helmets on one field all year. In this
way, one-third of the games (or more if Mac field is
used as the standard) played will involve the use for
the face guards rather than oneafifth by the other plan.

One or two preparations must be made by the In-
tramural department before the experiment can go
into effect. The IM managers, students in charge of
each field during each game, would have to keep a
close record of all head and facial injuries, especially
the kind that wouldn’t be reported to the nurse. The
latter category would include the minor bloody noses
or split lips that often occurl This information could
be briefly stated on a sheet listing name and nature of
injury.

Secondly, since the face guards do present a con-
venient hand-hold, referees would have to be briefed
about watching this type of offense closely. A tighten-
ing of the rules might also be coupled with this provid-
ing for removal from the game of anyone committing
two such offenses. ,

If the tests are carried out diligently, maybe we
will find that there is a positive correlation between
face guards and fewer injuries.

travels to Rock Island, 111., to-
morrow for a meet with Augus-
tana, the first after Christmas
vacation.

trance in the sprint events to-
morrow is doubtful.

droth will represent the Pier
users in the diving competition

and rebounding, They collected
54 rebounds to Gnnnell's ~12.

In the end, however, the Si-
wash were undone by their own
aggressiveness. They w o r a
charged with 18 personal fouls
in the second half to Grinnell’a
10. This enabled the Pioneers
to pick up badly needed points
at the free throw line.

was Kinkead with 22. Next on
the list was sophomore forward
Jeff Frantz with 17.
