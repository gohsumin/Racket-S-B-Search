‘Excellence of a Man'

The all-night hustle and bustle of getting out an
“extra exclusive edition,” doesn’t quite coincide with
sitting calmly down at the typewriter and trying to
evaluate Dr. Bowen‘s years of service and contribution
to the college. Therefore, that will not be our purpose
today.

ItJ is unfortunate that some of the immediate stu-
dent reaction to Dr. Bowen’s newly announced position
was touched with animosity and bitterness. There are
probably two dirgct reasons for this. First, the students
were completely taken by surprise— there had been
no~campus reference to the fact that the president was
being considered by SUI, and the 5&3 had never re-
ceived any word that such a big story was in the mak-
ing. Second, communication between the president and
the students had been cut off for the greatest share of
the winter due to the extensivarworld tour taken by
the president and his wife. During his leaves of absence,
new student leaders were both selected and elected,
and even though they were looking forward to work-
ing with the president, there had been no opportunity
to have recent associations with him.

Perhaps yesterday we felt cheated; but despite stu-
dent disagreement with administration policies, and
the breaks in student~administration relationship dur-
ing recent years, we can hardly feel that Grinnell Col—
lege has been cheated by Howard R. Bowen.

In his eight years as leader of the college, we have
seen the name and position of our liberal arts instiution
find increasing distinction throughout the nation. Pres—
ident Bowen and Grinnell College have become synony-
mous in educational circles for academic excellence
Disgruntled as students might be with the ideas of a
Grinnell Image, the fact that Dr. Bowen has made
glowing contributions to the image of ourcollege can-
not be denied. He has served tirelessly during his eight
years here the cause of better education and has sought
to further his ideal of a liberal arts education as con-
tributing directly to personal excellence in the student.

Dr. Bowen is admired by students, faculty and ad-
ministration, alumni, and friends of the college
throughout the world. During his recent tour, he repre-
sented the college to educators in Europe and Asia with
a sincerity and academic concern that is gratifying to
see in any person of leadership.

Mrs. Bowen has always been aliavorite of the stu-
dents. Her warm personality and direct personal con-
cern with the campus and its inhabitants is radiated
wherever she goes.

We will have plenty of time to evaluate, to criti-
cize, and to suggest. Our first concern should be to rec-
ognize the excellence of the man who has served us, and
who goes on now to new educational fields and respon-
sibilities. Dr. Bowen’s presence at Grinnell will be
missed, but his contributions will remain. We join all
the friends of the college who have expressed their
congratulations to President Bowen as a scholar, an
educator and a friend. We wish Dr. and Mrs. Bowen the
very best in their new roles at SUI.

Bowen Selected Grime/I Prexy
Over 100 Applicants In I955

A ten month search during
the academic year 1954-55 cul-
minated in the selection of
Howard Bowen to succeed
President Samuel N. Stevens,
who had resigned the J uno be-
fare.

The search was carried on
by a committee of seven mem-
bers of the Board of Trustees,
headed by John R. Heath, Chi<
cago attorney. Over 100 appli-
cants were considered. 25 were
interviewed and 15 visited cam-
pus, including Bowen.

In a statement to the 5&8
upon the announcement of his
appointment, Bowen Said, “I
look forward with keen antici-
pation to joining the commu-
nity of Grinnell College. One of
the greatest satisfactions of my
new job will be the opportunity
to meet you, work with you,
and share in your social and
intellectual life. I hope that to-
gether we may help to carry
on the fine traditions and the
strong community spirit that
have made Grinneli a distin—
guished liberal arts college."

Before coming to Grinnell,
Bowen was a professor of eco-
nomics at Williams College. Of
his departure the Williams Rec-
ord lamented, “With a definite
amount of mixed emotions, the
Record would like to add its
name to the long list of well-
wishers of Professor Howard
R. Bowen‘ who recently ac‘
cepted invitation to become
president of Grinnell College.
The invitation is a well de-
served opportunity for the
young professor of economics.

“But we at Williams cannot
allow Mr. Bowen to depart
from the local scene without
sincere regret. Mr. Bowen has
been a hard working, devoted
instructor who has never been
too busy to give counsel to in»
quiring students. A man of ex-
ceptional patience, Mr. Bow-
en’s aid and consideration‘ have
become an important part of
many Williams men’s educa—
tion during the last three years.

Mr. Bowen has in his Wil~
liams stay earned the label that

ranks above all degrees. He has
been a true educator, Williams
will miss a gentleman of great
ability and quiet, friendly marl~
ner. Congratulations, Mr. Bow»
en. We know that you will be
a success in your new position
as you were in your much too
brief Stay at Williams.”

Before assuming office July
1, 1955, Bowen visited campus
several times. On April 30 he
addressed an all-college assem-
bly in Herrick Chapel. In his
first official appearance on
campus Bowen offered several
remarks.

“First of all, I want you to
know how pleased and proud I
am to have been invited to join
you here. I have long been an
admirer of Grinneii. In fact, I
first visited the campus just 21

 

years ago this spring, and on
several occasions have attended
conferences here. But I think I
had not fully understood the tub
tent of its reputation until the
flood of mail began pouring in
after my appointment was an-
nounced. I wish that I might
read some of it to you. The con-
sistent theme is that Grinnell
is not just‘another small liberal
arts college. It is a Very special
institution with a unique and
precious heritage.

"I have asked myself: ‘What
accounts for the outstanding
reputation of Grinnell and for
the quite remarkable loyalty of
its alumni and friends?’ As I
have thought over this ques—
tion, I have reached Several
tentau've answers.

“G r i n n e I l’s reputation is
based in part, I think, on the
continuous Stream of talented
students it has attracted, on the
scholarly attainments of its
faculty, and on the exceptional
distinction of its alumni. But
beneath these outward signs,
the true source of its strength,
I think, has been its constant
dedication to the liberal arts,
its devotion to freedom of in
quiry and freedom of speech,
its consistent practice of de-
mocracy in every day campus
life, its concern for each indi-
vidual students as a distinctive
person, and the essential whole-
someness of its social life. And
I think Grinneii has been able to
hold fast to its principles be

Dr. Howard R. Bowen made
the following statement yester-
day afternoon at his press con-
ference in the library viewing
room:

“The State University of Iowa
is one of America’s great uni-
versities 4 one in which the
people of Iowa justly take great
pride. I am, of course, honored
to be elected as president. and
humbled by the responsibility
placed upon me.

“I look forward to my duties
especially because of my for-
mer association with the uni-
versity where I was a student
and faculty member for nine
years.

“At the same time, I leave
Grinneil College with deep re-
gret a n d great affection.
Grinneli is one of our coun-
try’s outstanding liberal arts
colleges. Through my expe-
rience in both public and pri-
vate colleges and universities,
I hope I may be instrumental
in establishing close ties be-
tween the State University
and the private colleges and
universities of Iowa and other
states.

“I seek support and coopera-
tion for the university from the
people of Iowa. An excellent

university is a cultural and eco-
nomic asset of the first order.
It is one of the prime require-
ments of a state and nation that
intends to develop culturally
and economically. I anticipate
that the State University of
Iowa will occupy a steadily in-
creasing role in the develop
ment of Iowa and the nation.”

 

cause of its traditional allegi-
ance to Christian values.

"When I say that Grinnell is a
great college, I do not mean to
imply that it is without prob-
lems. Obviously, we coma use
more money. Some new build-
ings are needed. According to
several articles in the Scarlet
and Black, the students might
be more interested in campus
affairs. The word “apathy" ape
peered several times. Doubt.
less, if I asked faculty mem-
bers, they would tell me that
students might be more inter-
ested in their studies. Perhaps
if I asked Students, they would
tell me that the faculty ought
to assign fewer papers an

grade more generously. 0
course there are problems at
Grinneli large ones and
small ones (and sometimes the
small ones are more trouble-
some than the large ones).

“But the problems of Grim
nell can be faced with confi-
dence, when we consider the
basic soundness of the college.
When the present problems are
solved, as I am sure they will
be, they will be replaced by
other problems. A lively, vital
college always has problems.
Awareness of them is a symp-
tom of the urge to improve. By
analyzing and facing up to our
problems, we are able to direct
0 ur efforts intelligently. I
earnestly hope that we shall
never be without problems, be;
cause problems represent a
kind of creative dissatisfaction
that will spur us on to build a
greater college.

“50, I, for one, approach the
coming years with a sense 01
confidence. This confidence is
based on the great traditions of
this institution. and on the fact
that we are Stimulated to con-
structive action by the aware-
ness of problems.

At commencement the new
president commented, “I shall
be learning about my new joli
while Working at it fulltime.
During the summer there are
many things to be done around
a College — even though the
students are gone. There are
problems of Staff recruitment.
finances. admissions, and prep-
aration for the opening of the
autumn semester."

Ludwig comments

Merritt c. Ludwig, vice-
president of the college,
made the following state-
ment last night concerning
the new appointment of Dr.
Bowen:

“Because so many oppor-
tunities for important and
perhaps greater service to
education have been present-
ed to President Bowen in re-
cent years, I think we all
knew that one which he
could not refuse would eveni-
ually come along. Even so, it
is hard to accept the idea
that he will soon be leaving
Grinnell College. We wish
him success in his new posi-
tion.”

Faculty Members Comment on loss;
Acknowledge Role as President Here

Regret over the loss of Pres-
ident Bowe'n was mixed with
feelings of happiness over his
new appointment when mem-
bers of the Grinnell faculty and
administration expressed their
reactions to Dr. Bowen's resig-
nation.

“It‘s a great loss for Grin-
nell," said N e at Klausner
(phil,). “He is the finest pres-
ident of any liberal arts college
I know anything about. I am
sure that he will be able to meet
the challenges and difficulties
at SUI. He has everything that
is necessary scholarship,
integrity, and stature.”

“My first reaction was one of
pleasure for him," said Dean
of Women Jean Slocum. "I was
greatly impressed by the staff
he has gathered around him,
SUI is very lucky; Grinnell will
miss him. People in whom he
has had faith and confidence
will somehow manage to carry
on.”

Herbert Prescott (journal-
ism) stated, “Dr. Bowen has
done great good. His resigna-
tion was inevitable; the college
has done well to have had him
as long as it has had him, Ilook
with interest to whom the
Board of Trustees will choose
to succeed him. Will they fol-
low the general procedure and
import someone, or will they

find someone from our own
faculty or administrau‘on?"
Associate Dean Waldo Walk—
er said, “I am very sorry that
he is going. I am very grateful
for what he has done for the
college in the last nine years.
I only hope that we can make
an approach at ﬁnding some‘
one as well qualified as be."

"It will be difficult for the
college to replace him. This is
a great opportunity for him to
mov e up in the education
world," commented Laird Bar-
ber (Eng). ’

Howard Burklo (phil. and
reel.) said, "I’m sorry he‘s go—
ing because he’s a fine college
president. I hope we get some-
one as good as he is and who
has been a teacher and has a
close connection with the
faculty."

Retired Dean of Women Ev-
elyn Gardner said, “I count
myself very fortunate to have
worked with Dr. Bowen for so
many years."

“I think it‘s a very great loss
for the college. His appoint-
ment at SUI is a recognition
from the state of Dr. Bowen’s
ability as an administrator,"
noted Joseph Wall (hist.).

Winston King (rel.) said,
“This comes as a surprise. Dr.
Bowen has pushed the college
forward in the direction it
ought to take.”

dorm for 98 men cost about
$400,000.

The money for the ambitious
program came from a series of
tuitions raises beginning in 1957
and bringing the college fees
from $1550 to the present 52500.
To aid students in meeting in-
creased oosts, an extended pay-
ment plan a radical innovation
was instituted. The plan re-
ceived nationwide press cover»
age and stimulated inquiries
from 35 colleges including Har-
vard.

The primary source of reve-
nue, however. came from do-
nations. By 1959 the ”current
development campaign" had
raised $2,000,000 toward a goal
of $2,460,000. The fund raising
drive received its largest boost
from the Ford Foundation in
the fall of 1961, In announcing

the grant before a convocation
of the college Bowen said,
“This will make possible a
marked accelleration of our
planning time table. Education-
a1 improvements scheduled for
5 or lo years from now will be»
come possible in z or 3 years
. . . We also know that a dra-
matie increase in financial re-
sources, such as this grant and
the matching gifts represents,
does not aulomatcally improve
education.”

Other improvements included
the opening of the Health Cen-
[er in 1957, and the beginning
of minor improvements in the
residence halls, such as re

 

roofing, replacement of furni-
ture, and painting rooms. The
Science Building was finished
in 1957, and an addition is pro-
jected. The Forum is presently
under construction and should
be ready by next fall.

Revamping of the curriculum
took place in 1959. Experiments
such as the JLA, the Humanie
ties and Historical Studies pro-
grams, and the 2.5 grade were
developed.

In student government, En—
campments were conducted in
1960, ’61, and '63. A new Con-
stitution for SGA was promul~

gated in 1961. Numerous re»

visions in rules, including the
latest liberalized drinking rule,
were passed. Open dorms were
instituted on an experimental
basis, also.

Besides the dynamic trans
formation of Grinnell, Bowen
delivered a series of thought
provoking addresses. His most
famous one, delivered last year,
was entitled “A Game of Num-
bers” and deplored the insis—
tence of colleges on statistical
measurement of students. He
offered specific recommenda-
tions for the deemphasis of
numbers: reducing graduation
requirements, instituting a sen-
ior essay, the keeping of a
"scholarly diary,” the reduce
tion by one-third of course exr
ams, and the inclusion of sen-
ior comprehensive grades in
averaging grade points. He also
suggested admitting a number
of students who indicate pro
mise, but do not have high
Board scores or grades.

 

Head Trustee
Hewitt Lauds
Bowen WOrk

Edwin S. Hewitt, chairman of
the Board of Trustees, the
group responsible for selecting
Dr. Bowen's successor, talked
to the 5813 last night from his
home in Libertyville, Illinois.

Hewitt had no comment con-
cerning what process had or
would be undertaken in finding
a new president, nor would he
say whether anyone now on
campus or any other certain
person was being considered
for the position.

On behalf of the trustees of
the college, Hewitt expressed
regret over the departure of
President Bowen, but assured
the college that every neces-
sary step would be taken to find
a worthy successor.

He made the following state-
meuti

“President Bowen is now
standing college president. It is
a disappointment to the trustees
as it is to all people interested
in Grinnell that he won’t be
president of Grinnell for the
rest of his career. We wish him
happiness and success in his
new position at the University
of Iowa, and we congratulate
him on this new position. We
know that he will bring the dis—
tinction to the University of
Iowa that he has to Grinnell.
We are grateful to him for his
contribution to Grinnell.”

Students Register Surprise, Shock
At Sudden News of SUI Appointment

"I’m shocked," seemed to be
the immediate reaction amOng
the student body when word
came that President Bowen had
been named as head of the Uni-
versity of Iowa,

Across campus, in the dining
halls, and within small groups
people looked at each other
saying, “Whatl When did this
happen."

“1 think it is sad that: he’s
leaving," Said Ann Van Guilder,
senior, “I am truly shocked,”
followed Alan Gummerson, jun-
ior, who added, “he was the
college."

Students were queried last
night concerning their initial
reaction to the news, One group
answered as follower

Pete Read, junior, newly
elected Cofl-iP president, “My
initial reaction was one of
shock. Dr. Bowen has con-
tributed a good deal to Grin-
nell and for most students his
departure will mean a re-evaiu-
ation of the so-called Grinnell
Image. We must realize mat
Grinnell’s ideals aren’t direct-
ly affected and we hope that a
new president can continue
Dr. Bowen’s interest in student
life."

Jim Parkinson, junior, “I am
very surprised. I am also dis-
appointed because I think we
were all looking forward to a
good year with the president.
If this is what he wants, I wish
him the best of luck."

Steve Grooms, senior,
don't believe it."

Ellen Brodsky, senior, “I am
surprised. I have a funny feel-
ing about the fact mat there
was never anything said before
today about his leaving. He‘s
done a lot for Grinnell; per-
haps he feels he’s done what he
can do for us, and that what
he can do for Iowa exceeds

“1

 

what he could further do for
Grinnell.”

Bill Abernathy, junior, “I was
disappointed in the man be.
cause he had created an image
in my mind which represented
him as dedicated to small lib-
eral arts colleges. 1 cannot help
but wonder if his resignation
represents a changing of horses
in mid-stream."

Ann Young, junior, "He will
probably find it a more come
fortable situation there, not so
close to the students. I feel he
won’t be able to do the progres-
sive things there that he was
able to institute here."

Jack Chapman, senior, this
year‘s president of the Student
G o v e rn m e n t Association,
“President Bowen, in his eight
year tenure at Grinnell, has
brought remarkable progress
to the school. Recent unfortw
nate events have impeded thi'
progress. He’s a great man."

Jim Herzog, formereditor of
the 58:3, “President Bowen”
departure w l l l undoubtedly
slow the school’s academic
process in innovating new pro-
grams and building drives.
However I feel that following
the debate over social struc-
ture of the college, perhaps h s
leaving will open new roads in-
to considering our institution.
Perhaps we can start over to
logically re-evaluate our pro-
gram."

Judy Edquist, junior, new
president of the AWS Board,
“The Contribution that presh
dent Bowen has made to the
academic life of the college is
noteworthy. I hope it will he
continued by his successor.”

Phil Johnson, newly elected
president of SGA, was in Sioux
City last night with the Young
Republicans, and could not be
reached for comment.

 

Other Statements

Following is part of a state—
ment made yesterday by Virgil
M. Hancher, retiring president
of SUI, concerning the appoint-
ment of Dr. Howard Bowen as
his successor:

“Dr. Bowen is a distinguished
economist who has had broad
experience as a professor, a
governmental official, a bank-
ing official, and a college presi-
dent. He has presided with dis-
tinction over Grinnell College
for nearly nine years, in which
position he has achieved state-
wide and national distinction.
He is highly respected by his
collea gu e sin educational
circles, all of whom join in con-
gratulations to him upon his ap~

lowing statement concerning
Dr. Bowen and Grinnell:

“Dr. Bowen had a national
reputation as an educator in
the field of economics before he
was called to Grinnell in 1955.
Under his leadership that col~
lege has advanced considerably
its reputation for scholarship
and sound educational prac-
tices. Both Grinnell and Dr.
Bowen have fully merited the
confidence displayed in them by
the Ford Foundation and other
leading educational agencies."
