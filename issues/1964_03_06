Annual White Caps Water Show
Wild iﬁgiiiiglit Rhythm Variations

Rhythm is the keynote of this
year’s White Caps water show,
titled ”Variations in Rhythm,”
which will be presented March
”-13 at 7:30 and 9 p.m.

Primitive drums, rock and
roll, Latin American music,
jazz, military and classical
music, Dixieland, and oriental
music on a Japanese koto will
provide the rich variety of
rhythms on which the acts are
based.

The members of White Caps
who have done the natagraphy,
the aquatic equivalent to chore-
ography, for the numbers have
tried to express the rhythms
through colorful costumes and
appropriate stunts and strokes.

One highlight of the show
will be the finale, a Roman
march based on music from

 

“Ben Hur" and natagraphed by

Barbara I Davis. Another
feature will be a musical pro-
gram by the Tanagers during
intermission. Martha Montgom-
ery and Sandra Kent wrote the

script.

The White Caps began pre-
paring for the show in October
and have practiced many hours
since then, including swimming
at 8 a.mr during the interim.
Although this will be the‘flrst
time in a college water show
for some, almost all the mem-
bers have had experience in
synchronized swimming in high
school.

The group is sponsored by
Miss Sandra Leaks and its
members in c l u d e Barbara
Jeanne Davis, president, Susan
Fritch, vice president, Nancy
Fawcett, secretary - treasurer,

 

Joen Crossman, Connie Sloop,

Mary Ellen Tierney, Betty
Stanek, Barbara J. Davis,
Cathy Coleman, Cidney Dun-
ning, Judy Mattox, Nicky Gerda
ing, Susan Taylor and Deanna
Downs.

The White Caps have been
assisted in the production of
the show by other studentsil
lighting, Sam Schuman; tape,
Jim Gugle; make-up, Diane
Dunkley: scenery, N a n cy
Cooke; and publicity, Carolyn
Schaefier. Stage managers are
Marsha Smith and Anne Hart.

Later this spring, the White
Caps plan to start workshops
to teach stunts and strokes to
anyone interested in trying out
for White Caps in the fall.
Newcomers can then practice
What they have learned in the
workshops over the summer.
New members are chosen for
their ability and potential.

Thoughts About New Dorm

Ed: Note: This is the first
of two articles being written
for the 5&3 by Ann Lousin.
Appearing this week as a
"guest editorial," the article
”does not necessarily repre-
sent the opinion of the 58:3
or its staff.

At a recent quarterly meet-
ing, the Board of Trustees
yoted to approve the plans for
It new men’s dorm, to be erect-

' ed in the near future, presum-
ably just north of the Norrises.
.This announcement met with
little opposition, for on first
glance it would appear that
there is a definite need of a
new hall, in view of our ex-
panding enrollment of men and
the considerable number of
men who now live off-campus.

Cause for Doubt

A closer inspection, how-
ever, reveals some reasons for
doubting the validity of such of-
ﬁcial reasoning. There is cer-
tainly an increase in the num-
ber of men students, either be-
cause more qualified men apply
or because of a rather naive be-
lief that an increase in the
male-female ratio Will improve
that hackneyed old bugaboo,
the “Grinnell social problem."
,But are there that many more
qualiﬁed malc applicants? Un-
til we discontinued Computing
hall averages, the women usu-
ally had distinctly higher grade-
points than the men and they
have long carried off a good
portion oi the Phi Beta Kappa
keys and graduate awards,

Furthermore, the president
has expressed concern that in»
telligent women do not obtain
a higher education and utilize
their abilities more for the
good of mankind. If Grinnell
is serious about this problem,
I should think that there would
be more attempts to alleviate
this, both by admitting more
qualiiied women and by encour
aging our women graduates to
put their most outstanding tal—
I‘mts to use. instead, the col-
lege admits more men.

More Do Graduate Work

While doing so, we are steadr
lly raising the standards of ad-
mission. so that now more grad»
uates—both men and women—
go on to graduate or profes-
sional school than ever before.
These people tend to postpone
marriage until their education
is completed, for school is difs
ricult enough and expensive
enough without the responsibil»
ity of a wife and family.

Of course, one may say
that the Grinnell cored gradu-
ate can work and put her hub»

i. f' i r

by through graduate school, but ,

 

all too often the girls educa-
tion is then abruptly terminat-
ed, when she had the ability to
continue it. This violates every-
thing Dr. Bowen said in his last
convocation. An even more
telling criticism of the attempt
to solve the social problem by
admitting more men is the
simple fault that it has not
worked—lets face it, men are
not going to date more simply
because there are more men
than women. Who subscribes to
that kind of logic?

The second reason that has
been advanced for building a
new mens dorm is that mere
are thirty men living off-camp-
us. Somehow or other this is
regarded as intrinsically an
evil. To be sure, Grinnell is a
residential college and it is a
positive good that most of the
students live in the dorms
(barracks, as one prof. put it).
but is it necessary to the co-
hesion of the student body that
everyone live on~campus? l
maintain that for some people
and some situations, off-camp»
us living is a positive good, for
themselves and for the college.

Language House Praised

Having lived for two years
on and two years off campus,
I can unhesitatingly say that
for language houses off-camp-
us living is a positive good and
that.off»campus housmg gener-
ally tends to be quieter, more
spacious, and betterrequipped.
Our tiny group of six, the Ger-
man House. has a complete
kitchenette b e tte r equipped
than any in the Quad. a bigger
lounge, our own library and
periodicals, and twice as big
a bathroom for our six then
we would have had in the Quad,
Admittedly, much of this comes
from our being a language-
house, but I have noticed that
even the off-campus men main-
tain that they have better fa-
cilities than on North Campus.

‘Growing Gulf’

Dr. Bowen has said that
there is a growing gull be-
tween the off-campus and on-
campus housing, which may be
true. But is this due to their
physical separation alone, or is
it also due to their different
desires? The generalization
that all North Campus consists
of crew-cut lettermen and that
all off-campus consists of shag-
gy beats is simply not true. As
part of the “Park Street Line”
I‘ve gotten to know several of
the off-campus men, and I‘ve
found them as diversified as
any group, united perhaps by

Rosenfield Questions Friedlander’s Attack on Ford Fund

To the Editor:

As a graduate and long time
trustee of the college, my in
terest is aroused by Dan Fried-
lander's letter to the editor
criticizing the Ford matching
fund drive. While, frankly, I do
not fathom some of Mr, Fried-
lander’s arguments, I gather
that he feels that some kind of
a fraud has been committed on
the student body, that the
money is not being well spent,
and that in order to raise this
money, student government and

student action has been cur-
tailed.

None of these contentions is

valid. The six million dollars
which is being raised will be
spent for a variety of purposes.
all well publicized and all for
the direct benefit of the college
and. its student body. These in-
clude additional faculty salar~
ies, buildings and increased
endowment. if this six million
dollars had not been raised,
student tuition would ultimately
have to be increased to absorb
this sum or the college’s stan-
dards would suffer accordingly.
The fact that tuition has been
raised annually is regrettable.
but these sums have not been
buried underground, but have
been used for college expenses,

 

'Aware' Men Make Suggestion
For 'More Siimulaling' Break

To the Editor

We heartily agree with Miss
Muffie Meyer’s proposal com
cerning interim. Intellectual
pursuits definitely wane during

this period. The inexperienced
freshmen and sophomores need
guidance to realize their poten-
tial for independent study. Jun-
iors and seniors need second
ary interests to supplement
their required studies—the JLA
and comps. An experienced,
aware student has recognized
tlle flaw and suggested meas»
ures to remedy it. (Critics take
note; the student body does
contain responsible, concerned
students.)

Since a student has made the
first suggestion, we feel that the
subsequent ones should also be
proposed by equally aware
students. As Miss Muffie Meyer
has pointed out, students need
guidance. in the spirit of her
original proposition, we pro-
pose specific projects” . . . as
absolutely free and independent
as the student Wishes.”

1, For the literati e, e. Cums
rnins’ entire works might be
gramatically revised, employ«

 

ing the canons of the MLA
Style Sheet.

2. To broaden one’s scope,
independent study could be car-
ried out in different environs.
For e x a m p l e, probability
theory could be studied in Las
Vegas; dermatology in Flori-
da; or Alpine athletics in As-
pen, Colorado. '

i. iearn the Dewey Decimal
System. (For the more inspired
the Library of Congress System
might also be included.)

4. For an interdisciplinary
project, the group dynamics of.
and the individual’s non-verbal
experience in, a “bender~end-
er,” to use the colloquial term,
might warrant consideration.
This project would entail fre-
quent seminars of extended
duration. If considerable stu-
dent interest were shown,
school funds might be used to
finance serious research.

The above suggestions are in-
tesesting but intellectually stim«
ulating. We hope Griunell stu-
dents do not muff their oppor-
tunity.

Grinnell Sludenl Thoreaus Tanlrums,
Flies Off Handle at B and G's Walden

To the Editor:

Dear Mr. Walden:
With the return of the warm

weather, all 48 hours of it,
there has come the return of
the flies. Due to a loose screen
in my window. I now have 11
flies, 26 dead ones, and 8 in
their death throes. Actually this
is a minor problem at the mo-
ment, but if this weather should
continue, it is probable that this
problem will increase to the
proportions that it reached last
fall.

From the beginning of school
until the bitter Cold of last No»
vember. there existed a coiled
tion of hundreds of live, dead,
and dying flies between my
screen and window. Most of
these creatures confined them-
selves to this area which
measures 51" by “/2", but a
few, 1042, in a final attempt to

 

avoid death, tried tolfly and,

found themselves buzzing helpr
lessly on the furniture, floor,
and bells. And as unbelievable
as it may sound, all fall there
existed a layer of dead and dy-
ing flies, 3 and 4 bodies deep in
the area. between window and
screen.

Because of the size of our
room it has been necessary to
place my bed next to the win-
dow, parallel to the outside
wall. Therefore, on a warm
night I have me pleasure of
knowing that every breath l
breathe has been filtered over
a 1 inch layer of dead and dy-
ing fly bodies. Not only is that
distasteful to think of, it is also
unhealthy to exist with.

Although this letter may
seem to contain gross exagger-
ations, I can assure you that

largely faculty salary in-
creases. It is not by accident
that Grinnell has collected and
retained an outstanding faculty.

The assertion that student
government and liberties have
been circumscribed because of
this drive is also untrue. The
trustees have accepted a ma-
jor part of the responsibility
of this drive and their activities
have never been inﬂuenced by
student rules or student gov<
ernment, As a matter of fact,
several of the official acts of
the trustees and the adminis-
tration have knowingly resulted
in the loss of revenue to the
college. As an illustration, 1h:
college, through official action
by the faculty and the trustees,
consistently refused to accept
from the federal government
hundreds of thousands of loan
funds as long as the taking of
the loyalty oath was required
from the student. This not only
resulted in the loss of govern.
ment funds but also resulted in
the loss of a number of sub-
stantlal gifts including the
probable loss of a million dol-
lars for a new building.

But what bothers me most
is the cynical and disdainful
attitude expressed by Mr.
Friedlander toward alumni giv-
ing. This giving is the life blood
of the college’s existence and
must be maintained in an uni<
terrupted manner if the excel-
lencc of the college is to con-
tinue. in the past, when com
nomlc depressions or tempor-
ary lack of faith in the college
has developed, the stature of
the school has diminished in
alarming proportions.

Over the long stretch, the
college has been fortunate in
having thousands of alumni
and friends whose millions of
dollars of gifts lifted Grinnell
college to its pre-eminent po-
sition among the Small liberal
arts colleges of the country.
And equally fortunate are these
alumni because, through their
generosity, they have given
added meaning to their own
lives by supporting a college
which has become very person-
al and dear to them.

Graduating Class Bequeatlis Heritage
0! Challenging Attitude Toward Rules

To the Editor-x

Although it is too early in the
year to become sentimental
about the inevitably emotional
ritual of graduation, it is not
too early to take notice of what
the passing of the class of 1964
will mean for this institution.
With mixed emotions we are
now witnessing the withdrawal
from student government of the
spokesmen of the class of '64
and their replacement by a
new class which promises to
be different.

The alumni, I am told, are
more anxious to see this class
leave and would move heaven
and earth to see that nothing
like us happens to this school
again. What sort of people were
we that we have earned such
ill favor? The class of 1899 left
us the Women’s Gym; What, if
anything,’ is the heritage of the
class of 1964?

First, I believe it is proper
to speak of the class as an
identifiable entity, because,
though this year’s student gov-
ernment was only representing
student opinion as a whole,
much or the time, they were by
far the most articulate and con-
sistent forces for rules reforms
in the recent history of the cob
lege.

As a group the class, and
particularly its leadership, can
be describe we were vocal.
we were pol cal and (some~
what less) legalistic, we were
idealistic, we held very liberal
moral beliefs and we were self<
centered. Does this constitute a
heritage?

Apparently it does Students
in American colleges have al«
ways chafed at restrictions on
their freedom of action, but the
traditional response has been a
blend of smothered resentment
and covert disobedience. Stu-
dents have not admitted that
college rules actually had the
ethically binding character of
a fundamental moral law; vio-
lation of such rules was only
a crime When you were caught.

The contribution of the class
of '64 was a new, “experimen-
tal" attitude regarding rules
which was at once moralistic,
idealistic, and responsible and
a new conception of student as
a political instrument of reform.
Peter and Jack told us that a
rule was a thing we ought to
obey, and if obeying it proved
noxious the only responsible re-
course would be to write a new
rule.

The alternative for continu-
ing to beg the question with in-
stitutionalized hypocrisy (by
an intentionally inefficient rules
enforcement system) hardly
'seemed attractive The student
body responded, to the amaze-
ment of many, by electing the
most articulate portion of
1964's “beatnik horde" to the
highest office: in student gov-
ernment.

What then is the legacy of
these people? Despite the unan-
imous criticism of the Chapman
regime by those seeking his of~
fice, every platform contains
the planks of rules reform and
moral commitment to rules.
What is new, we see, is the
“attitude" which our new
leaders will manifest while cone

 

tinuing the work of the old
guard, The new leaders will
wear smiles and more accept-
able haircuts, but they under-
stand their offices in those
same terms which their prede-
cessors formulated,

There is one change in em-
phasis, however, which seems
both notable and regrettable.
The plank of responsibility met
with student opposition while
the plank of reform met with
administrative opposition. Of
the two, the administration
(along with those mysterious
foes, the alumni) proved the
more resistant. What we now
see is a new student commit»
ment to the old, obnoxious
rules.

To make matters worse, our
efforts at publicizing our cause
have put the administration
and their policies very much on
the spot, with the effect that
they now respond from impa~
tience and from an understand-
able reaction to outside pres-
sure,

College students of the late
1950's are already called the
“apathetic" or “silent” gener-
ation. If we were self-centered
and academically disinterested,
we were certainly not silent on
the issue of personal freedom

The leadership of this class,
moreover, was sincere in its
conviction that it’s beliefs were
morally defensible; it labored
to develop a concrete “student
ethic" to justify its moral
stance. This ethic, insofar as
any single ethic existed,
claimed that all decisions of
morality were “up to the in-
dividual" unless they affected
someone else's rights. The most
sophisticated statement’of this
philosophy is found in the En-
campment Report, specifically
in the report from the commit-
tee on “student responsibility."
The best embodiment of the
philosophy in 3 rules system is
found in the same report under
the Committee on rules.

The strain Of idealism has

succumbed wholly to frustra-
tion. The recent notorious open
rooms oath was signed by
many who saw nothing Wrong
with taking “any" approach to
the administration, "so long as
it works," The idealogical as-
sault did not get results; it is
hardly likely that an opportun-
ism which lacks Conviction will
succeed.
’ Cynicism‘and disinterest are
the dominant moods of the stu»
dent body now, The political ex-
periment clearly fizzled. Yet as-
piring student leaders, despite
disappointment with the Chap-
man administration’s inability
to produce the sought reforms,
are unable to reject the politi-
cal approach to the rules prob-
lem, '

So Where do we stand with
respect to last year? Relations
with faculty, trustees, admin-
istration and alumni are con-
siderably deteriorated.‘Students
are enforcing rules they con-
sider obnoxious. The political
approach to rules, having
failed, remains the dominant
self-conception of student gov—

so far. Happy recently made
a pitch for teen-age support by
endorsing the Beatles as a good

claims that his leading oppo-

against social security. Gold-
water says this is not true at
all; that he just doesn’t want
anybody to receive social se-
curity payments unless they
are holding down a full time

Richard Nixon wants it firm-

Sanity ot Stones

Ernst Aust, editor of a week-
ly newspaper in Hamburg,
West Germany has been sen-
tenced to a year in jail for
writing articles against the re-
armament of Germany and for
peace and military neutrality
Officially the charges against
Aust, the editor-publisher of the
peace oriented Blinkfeuer, are
“endangering the state,” “in-
suiting the federal govern«
ment,” and “supporting the
Communist Party.‘ ’ \

During a three month trial
that ended January 6, the pros
ecution “proved" that Aust
consistently endangered and in-
sulted the government since
1956 by writing untirrearma-
ment articles. Aust’s “support
of the Communist Party,"
which incidentally is outlawed
in West Germany, was proven
through the following rather
subtle form of reasoning:

The Communist Party, it is
”widely known," advocates
peace and disarmament; thus
by simple extension, anyone, in
this case Aust, who favors these
goals is obviously ”lending sup—
port to the Communist party."

Aust, who was a paratrooper
during the Second World War,
recently wrote that as a result
of his military experiences, “I
swore that I would never again

 

acquiesce in the misleading of
a whole generation of German
young people.” Blinkfeuer is
still being published as the edi-
tor appeals‘the cases

Here’s a story with a some-
what “happier endingr” About
a year ago Talmadge Balsar,
of Delaware, was convicted of
stealing in Wilmington by
Judge Stewart Lynch to 25
years in j 'l and 20 lashes to
be administered during a public
whipping. Last November the
State Supreme Court ordered
Judge Lynch to resentence Bal-
sar~not on humans grounds, to
be sure, but because the origi-
nal sentence was invalid since
the judge had neglected to set
a specific date for the whip-
ping, as required by Delaware
law,

In the interim period. it ap-
pears that the judge’s con-
science became operative, and
in resentencing Balsar January
7 the judge decided to reduce
the prison term to 15 years and
the public whipping, which took
place January 28, to ten lashes.

Plans are now being made for
the 1964-65 French House, Any

The
Audience

A review of the play. “The
Tidings Brought to Mary,”
presented by the Grinnell Col-
lege Players February 22 and
23.

By Sam Schuman

”The Tidings Brought To
Mary" is a peculiar and diffi-
cult play It attempts to pre-
sent a Christmas miracle,
without becoming a Christmas
miracle play, Claudel has
achieved this purpose largely
through characterization. He
has made Violaine, the central
character of the play, a saintly
human being, but not a saint.
Mara, Who should be the evil
sister is, in her way, admirable,
and, in the final scenes of the
work, pathetic, Thus Claudel
has avoided simplemindedness
and created a complex and
worthwhile piece of drama,

But this factor of literary
subtlety becomes a matter of
great theatrical difficulty.
Gretchen Geyer as Violaina
was forced to attempt to pro<
sent a character whom the
audience could accept as both
a human being and a miracle
worker, Miss Geyer success-
fully created this demanding
part. This success was due in
large part to the honesty and
simplicity in both her speech
and movement,

The role of Mara, played by
Sue Monro, also seemed quite
well done Despite her entrance
as the wicked witch of the
West (an entrance demanded
by the play), Miss Monto gave
us a Mara who was, in her own
words “a naked sword," which
is a far cry from the bloody
axe which might have been
forced upon us by a lesser ac»
tress.

Keith Felton, as Jaques the
knife~throwing farmer, played
quite well Claudel’s character
whose feet are planted so firm-
ly in the soil that he is con-
fused by anything more spirit~
ual than crop rotation

The fact that no one left the
theatre during the long and dif.
ficult prologue is sufficient
praise for Ken Freedman’s pre
sentation of Pierre de Craonr

Terry McCoy as the father
was particularly outstanding in
Act 1, scene 1.

Although the technical as<
pects of the show, designed by
Mr. William M,,Sherman of
Bennington, were superb, we
are rather saddened and
ashamed to think that Grinnell
must have outside support, both
intellectual and financial, to de«
cently stage a show which was
otherwise competent, exciting,
and worthwhile.

Hatha Yoga is Grinnell's new—
est way of physical condition
ing.

The Yoga Club, organized
and taught by Phil Brown, of-
fers an alternative to Body

Building with the Royal Canar
dian Air Force program. Work
in this club may count as a
_ minor in physical education.

Hatha Yoga is an exercise
program based upon deep
breathing while maintaining
various postures. Its history
reaches back over 2000 years
and its foundation lies in the
philosophical systems of the
East.

“Yoga, in its Indian context,
is a set of six philosophical
systems whose adherents seek
Spiritual union with the trans-
cendant self,” said Phil.

He explained, “Each person
may choose the yoga he finds
best. Hatha Yoga is a part of
Raja Yoga, the most sophis-
ticated system which is based
upon concentration and medi-
tation. Concentration requires.
a strong, healthy, pure mind,
and this in turn requires a
strong, healthy, and pure
body. This is where Hatha
Yoga comes in. It is the yoga
of physical conditioning.

“Although Hatha Yoga is
‘ part of a way of life, the exer-
cises are good in themselves.
I’m not really teaching Yoga,
but merely the Yoga system of
exercise.”

In this program the perfec-
tion of all systems of the body
is stressed. Muscular develop-
ment is only one of a number

YWCA Investigates,

Aims and Purposes

The Grinnell College YWCA,
under the direction of President
Ann Bacon, is participating in
a nationwide three-phase study
of the wording of the student
,YWCA statement of purpose.

Sponsored by-the National
Student Council, the study is
aimed at two goals: to deter4
mine if the existing statement
of purpose expresses adequate.
1y what today’s Y is, and to
ascertain the possibility of hav»
ing one purpose statement for
the total YWCA movement.

Members of the campus club
have formed-committee groups
to discuss and formulate the
aims of their organization.
These groups are analyzing the
importance of the Y’s Christian
purpose and its function of pro-
,viding for women students’ cur»
rent needs.

Grinncll’s Y emphasizes the
latter aspect, as an opportunity
for community service to hos-
pitals, nursing homes, Camp-
ure and Girl Scout groups,
civic organizations, and Uncle
Sam’s Club and m campus ac-
tivities such as selling Home»
mming buttons and food during

the brain, thyroid, pituitary and

Phil said, “Western systems
of exercise seem to come up
with similar system although
our emphasis is primarily on
one aspect of body condition-
ing and our exercises are rep-
etitious and vigorous. The more
medical information we gain
about exercise, the closer we
find ourselves to the Yoga prin—
ciples. The myths about the
origins of these exercises get
very supernatural, but the fact
is the exercises have developed
into something valid. I try not
to make claims in class about
the benefits, but I feel pretty
sure that they are tremendous.”

Phil became interested in
Hatha Yoga as a senior in high
school when he was investigat-
ing the philosophy and religion
of India. He is self taught, al-
though he spent a few days with
a Yoga master whose book
he had been using while he
was abroad last year.

Alt, Johnson, Spence Recount
Variety of Political Experiences

March 15 is the deadline for
submission of applications for
this summer's Political Interne
ship p r o g r a m. Application
forms are available in Room
207, Carnegie, from C. Edwin
Gilmour, PPPE director, or
from his secretary.

By Suzanne Gelber

A summer of superlatives,
responsibility and hard work,
a three-month madhouse de-
scribe the political internships
sponsored by PPPE as seen by
last summer's interns—Mari-
lyn Alt, Phil Johnson, and Jack
Spence.

Chosen by application (which
lsenow open), interns receive
a $500 stipend for two months
work from PPPE; a third
month of work and salary is
the option of individual con-
gressmen with whom interns
are placed. Election years
mean work on Congressional or
gubernatorial campaigns, while
years between elections find
tnost interns at Work in Wash-
ington, D. C., on Congressional
offlce staffs.

From pasting labels to sec-
retarial work, from greeting
constituents to background re-
search on legislation, Marilyn
Alt expended her energies in
the office of Neal Smith, Dem-
ocratic representative from
Des Moines. Fifth District. “I
did what other staff members
couldn’t get to," stated Mari-
lyn. A political science major,

 

Marilyn attended open commit-
tee hearings and spent a day
with 6|) Methodist Youhh Fel-
lowship members when Civil
Rights was under debate.

Acting as legislative assistant
to Congressman Fred Schwen-
gel, 3 Republican from Daven-
port, Iowa, Phil Johnson en»
joyed close contact with legisla-
tive affairs and techniques.
Johnson had a desk in Schwen-
gel's inner office from which he
called Congressional commit-
tees to discover the status of
pertinent legislation, as part
of his duties or legislative re-
search. Phil wrote synopses of
bills for Schwengel and actual»
ly wrote sections of bills the
Congressman intended to intro-
duce.

As did the other interns,
Jack Spence noted that “an-
swering constituent mail pro-
vided an interesting exercise
in knowledge of Congressional
style, and demanded a com-
plete knowledge of the stand
the Congressman took on a
Wide variety of legislation."
Jack spent his summer in Wis-
cousin in Senator William Prox-
mil‘e's ”informal workshop.”

‘The typical senatorial staff
has 15 members," stated Jack,
“and the atmosphere of each
office reflects the Congression-
al personality it houses." Com-
menting on the mail situation,
Jack explained that the office
received 400-500 pieces of mail
daily, about 80 per cent of
which had to be answered per-

 

Newa-formed Grinnell Civil Rights Club
To Replace Civil Rights Talk with Action

By Ann Showalter

”We want to stop talking
about civil rights and start act<
lng," stated Susan Goldberg,
one of the organizers of the re
cently formed Grinnell Civil
Rights Group.

In view of the significance of
the civil rights movement and
of the role of students in it, the
group has been formed “to pro-
vide the college community
with an opportunity to learn
about and to become active
participants in this nationwide
movement.”

Susan stressed the group's
concern with getting the towns-
people of Grinnell involved in
the program. “Some members
of the Grinnell Ministerial As-
sociation seemed very interest-
ed, and none were hostile” at a
meeting Monday with represen—
tatives from the civil rights
chapter.

“We plan to take a survey of
town opinion on the civil rights
problem in general and on spe.
cific issues such as willingness
to sell houses to Negroes," she
continued.

The group plans to hold a

hindralsing work day before'

the spring recess. Members
will wash Wllltlows, do spring
cleaning and outdoor tasks ap~
propriate to the weather ior
(acuity and townspeople.
Another pie-v cation project

 

will he a Showing of ”I’ll Never

“We would like to send some

said.

A civil rights bulletin board
will present current develop-
ments ill the field and opportun-
ities for students to continue

sonally. ”When I answered
mail, I had to assume the char-
acter of William Proxmire,
down to the last detail," ob-
served Jack. Mail is divided
into several categories: legisla~
tive, case, and personal mail.
Legislative m a i l originated
from both individuals and
groups and dealt with or re—
quested tha Senator’s opinion
on hills. Case mail consisted
of communication regarding ap«
pointments and other requests.

In a basement room, which
the Senator shared with a lobby
group and a second Senator,
was located an automatic let-
ter—typer and automatic pen to
deal with form letters. Activia
ties within the senatorial office
itself ranged from publishing a
newsletter, to speech composi—
tion, to wrlting books, to case
work on bills, and Spence found
his job a great opportunity “to
really get to know staff mem-
bers who were on the inside
track.”

Intense exposure to a sum-
mer of politics led Phil to com-
plete an independent research
project on minority staffing and
Marilyn to set up the campus
political symposium. Spence
hopes to find a place on Sena-
tor Proxmire's campaign staff
this summer. All three interns
agreed that the internship was
an “extremely valuable experi-
ence,” as Johnson put it,

“Learning how a Congress~
man operates just isn’t in text-
books,” commented Phil, who
also mentioned discovering the
importance of personal contacts
in politics. Despite a lack of
formal orientation and a “pert-
Od of adjustment,” the interns
commented on Congressional
helpfulness and the air of re-
sponsibility which accompanied
their positions. “I came away
with the conviction that Con-
gressmen are people after all,"
joked Marilyn.

Informality characterized the
interns’ living arrangements.
Marilyn lived with four June
graduates, riding to work on a
bus and fixing meals with the
other girls. A rented room in
the middle of American Uni-
versity housed Phil Johnson,
while Jack Spence commuted
from suburban Bethesda, Mary-
land,

The intern trio attended a
number of discussion groups
slated particularly for the thou-
sand or so interns which Wash-
ington accommodated last sum-
mer. Hours of less formal dis
cussion vied with lectures, con<
certs, parties, and committee
meetings for the interns' free
time. The late President Ken-
nedy addressd the student
group, as did congressmen who
spoke on their areas of special-
ization.

Applicants must state
preferences as to winch sena-
tors or representatives or can-
didates not presently in office
they want to serve and the rea-
sons for their choice. Ques-
lions asked of applicants reier

Listeners to student comments on Chicago's Paul TI ich in: iated the

use of the Re

Activities Room last week in Steiner. The room has been remodeled under the dire
the Hoard of Religion and is now open to student groups for meetings and discussions.

 

Religious Board Opens Religious Activities Room
For Committee Meetings and Discussion Groups

The newly remodeled Relig-
ious Room on the second floor
of Steiner is now open to all
students. This campus addition,
which boasts wall-to-wall car-
peting, wood paneling and mod-
ern furniture, will be used for
Board of Religion and commit“
tee meetings, meetings of camp-
us denominational groups, stu-
dent-faculty groups discussing
campus problems, and informal
groups wishing to discuss top-
ics of a religious or philosophi-
cal nature.

In addition, all students are
encouraged to use the room,
which is open from 7 am. to 10
pm, Monday through Saturday,
and 1 pm. to 10 p.111. Sunday,

it does not. Our maid would
yacuum the window of its con—
tents on Monday and by Tues~
day the numbers would again
be in the hundreds.

One fly in his death throes is
quite noisy but can you imagine
the racket produced by one
hundred and thirteen such
creatures in the same condi-
tion? it is not conducive to the
sleep required by all human
beings.

This problem has 1: e e n
brought to the attention of your
office twice: once last October
and again two weeks ago. As of
yet, you have chosen to do
nothing about the situation. I
can envision three possible
courses of action for you. First,
you could send a couple of your
men over to remove the screen
completely. This would pre-
yent the flies from becoming
trapped and would permit the
entrance 0! more dangerous in-
sects such as wasps, bees, and
hornetsi Since I suffer from ‘31-
lergies that require weekly
shots, a sting from such an in-
sect could cause a violent re—
action and might eyen result in

 

snuffing out my young life.

The second alternative is to
have the upper portion of me
window loosened from its
painted-shut state which would
allow one to stuff the opening
with newspaper or the like.

Thirdly, the screen could be
nailed securely shut, thus pre—
venting the entrance of the
flies.

Seriously, Mr. Walden, l’m
not looking for perfection. One,
two or even twenty ilies are
quite easy to ignore. but when
it gets up into the hundreds
(and the maid can vouch for
this fact) it becomes very hard
to take. Please, will you see to
it that something is done to
rectify the situation.

Name Withheld

The Board of Religion ex»
pects that the newly remodeled
room will meet many needs of
individuals and student groups.
The remodeling was begun last
year by the creative arts co-or—
dinator of the Board of Religion
working with an administra-
tion and faculty committee, and
has been brought to completion
by this year’s creative arts co-
ordinator, Jean Watsoni The
room is now the responsibility
of the Religious Activities Com-
mittee.

Anyone wishing to reserve
the room for a meeting should
contact Rockne McCarthy or
Judy Edquist, co-chairmen of
the committee. A schedule of
meetings will be posted outside
the door of the room.

T. Parsons Labels 20th Century as Turbulent, Creative;
Sees Societal Stabilization; Lauds Generality in Studies

Dr. Talcott Parsons, professor
of sociology at Harvard, was a
ampus guest

arly this week

as part of the

' “Interdisciplin-

ary Seminar on

rder.” A for-

mer student at

- School of eco-
omics and the
U niversity of
Heidelburg, he
' has h e a d e d
”R50” H a r vard’s In-
terdisciplinary Department of
Social Relations for the past 20
years.

By Karen Adkinson

“I believe that the twentieth
century will come to be viewed
like the seventeenth century —
a turbulent time, uncomfort-
able to live in, but highly cre-
ative,” asserted Talcott Par-
sons, noted sociologist.

“Oui- generation has been
through tremendous s o c i a 1
changes. Nineteen fourteen
was the end of the Old Europe,
The precariously b a la n c e d
state system of the 19th century
was ended. The subordination
of extra-European territories
was gone permanently. Inter»
nai transformation took place.
The next generation has a ter-
rific job ahead of it, but there
is some prospect of a stabiliza»
tion with the more Violent dis
turbances near the periphery
rather than in the center. This
does mean a continuation of
coups in Latin America and
situations like South V i e t
Nam," he concluded.

Parsons denies that modern
society is tending toward more
centralization and rigidly or»
dered society “except in per;
iods of crisis and only in limit-
ed sectors."

He used the modern univer-
sity as an example, “The ma-

 

dern university is an extraord
inary phenomenon. Never has
mere been an organization so

complex which has allowed for
so much autonomy."

Parsons was a biology major
as an undergraduate at Am»
herst. He has studied at the
London School of Economics
and Heidelberg University as
well as at Harvard

"1 cannot voice any regrets
at being a generalist. Speciali-
zation in generality, or method
in madness," he said playfully,
“is actually a better expression
because there must be some
organizing principle which links
g e n e r a 1 studies. Being a

specialist is safer; a generalist
runs the risk of superficiality;
but if knowledge, which is sys-
tematic, is to be organized,
generalists are necessary."

Parsons noted another mo-
dern intellectual d i l e m m a,
“There is a deep tension in in-
tellectual circles today between
the organized skepticism of
science and the need for the
kind of Commitments which
can be the basis for action and
yet be intellectually respect-
able. The extremists forego in-
tellectual respectihility in or-
der to push their cause, but for
me majority this deep tension
is not so easily resolved,”

_ only one thing: their dislike of

living with the same group of
men for four years, especially
in particularly noisy or other
wise bad living conditions.

While I think it is true that
off-campus people tend to be—
or to become—more individual-
istic, I hardly think that individ-
ualism even with its inherent
possibility of unthinking non-
conformism, is in itself undesir-
able. Let’s not forget that most
of the leaders of Grinnell’s newA
ly-formed Civil Rights Group
are off-campus dwellers and all
are rather determined noncon-
formists. So this is bad?

Besides, what makes anyone
think that throwing all of these
people back into the milieu of
North Campus is going to
change them? Many of the serr
iors, victims in their freshman
year of admissions-office mis-
calculations, are understand-
ably going to be withdrawn—
even somewhat anti-social—for
the rest of their Grinnell days.
To be sure, the Dean of Men
has had problems with North
Campus, too, Does anyone
really think that all the drunk-
enness, all the Boar‘s Heads,
or all the illegal visits occur
off-campus?

One last point: the students
have thought well enough
(which means that they have
first known well enough) of
three off»oampus»type men to
elect them to the mrea highest
positions men can hold on this
campus for this past year.

ernment. The ardor of reform
and idealism has been replaced
by cynicism and distrust. Un-
deniably, this is a “revoltin'
predicament.”

Without taking the time to
defend this stand, I suggest
ah immediate change of direc-
tion. The optimum solution of
good rules and strict enforce-
ment is intolerable. Since poor
rules are the "given" or un-
changeable factor, it seems that
the only realistic response is
the traditional one of discrete
evasion of the rules governing
personal conduct.

That is to say, I advocate a
return to hypocrisy. It is no
more unprincipled to disregard
a rule affecting personal moral
conduct which you sincerely op-
pose for moral reasons that it
is to subject yourself to an un-
realistic, artificial and unneces<
sarily restrictive code of con-
duct. The tacitly understood
flexibility of rules which has
generally prevailed in our uni-
versities and colleges seems to
me far more compatible with
the serious business of an edu‘
cation than the foolishly rigid
conduct control, with its accom-
panying resentment, n n d e r
which we are now living.

Pioneers Win T

By Pete Kollrnan

Grlnnell’s Pioneers moved
back into contention for third
place in Midwest Conference
action last week by defeating
two Wisconsin members of the
conference, L a W r e n c e and
Ripon.

On Friday night Grinnell
played one of its best offen-
sive games of the season.
pulling away from Lawrence
to win, 97-82l The Pioneers
led all the way, the margin
between 5 and 10 points dur-
most of the first half, and
reaching 17 points before the
finish. The halftime tally
showed the Pioneers ahead
by 5, 43-43.

John Sundell and Jim Mifflin,
Grinnell's senior co-captains,
turned in terrific performances,
Mifllln connected on 15-22 from
the field and 7-8 from the foul
line to total 37 points, a season
high for Grinnell and a persom
al high for Mifflin. Sundell hit
82% from the field and finished
with 18 points; he also pulled

his total of 31 in an earlier
game against Knox. As far as
shooting percentage is con-
cerned, the teams were re-
markably even; the ?ioneers
bit 43% and the Vikings, 40%,

Saturday afternoon ‘saw one
of the most exciting games of
the season played against con-
ference champion Riponl The
Redmen came into town after
beating Cornell and assuring
themselves of a share of the
title.

The first half was poorly
played, and neither team could
get more than a four point lead.
With four minutes left in the
half, All-Conference Jack An-
kerson, drew his fourth foul
and remained on the bench un-
til 10 minutes remained in the
game. The first half ended 30-
28 in favor of Grinnelll The sec.
and half followed the same pat-
tern as the first, with the Pio-
neers ahead most Of the time.

With about seven minutes
left, Grinnell upped their lead
to nine points, and the Redmen
were unable to decrease it ap-
preciably until less than two
minutes remained. With about
one and a half minutes left,
Mifflin had connected with two
free throws to put the pioneers
ahead seven when Ripon came
down the floor, scored, stole
the ball and connected on a 3
point play to cut Grinncll's
margin to 2. Three jump balls
followed in the next 30 seconds
and Rippon came down the
floor to try for a last shot with
lo seconds left. A shot was
blocked as the horn sounded,
leaving the Grinnell team and
their fans limp but victorious.

Jeff Frantz led the Plo«
neers in the scoring column.

snatched 23 rebounds off the
boards. Grinnell hit 41% from
the field; the Redmen, 37%.
The Weekend saw Sundell

stones. John pulled in 52 re-
bounds for a career total of 98.
Mifflin popped in 51 points over
the weekend to pass the ”1,000a»
point” milestone.

Swimmers Journey To Monmouth:
Conference Championship Meel

Carleton College is a slim fa-
vorite to repeat for tShe third
straight year as Midwest Con-
ference swimming champion at
the meet this weekend in the
Monmouth College pool,

The Carls lost several lead-
ing swimmers by graduation,
but still have an individual
titlist, backstroker Scot MC-
Conachie, and several placers,
Stan Siefer, Stu Wilson, Dave
Goldstein. John Kaiser, and
Dennis Meadows, back,

Picked to be the toughest
challengers are Beloit and Law-
rence, with the host Scots ex-
pected to be in the thick of the
fight. Beloit, last year’s runr
nerup, has two outstanding
swimmers in John Van Slyke
and Bill Putnam. Van Slyke
won the individual medley and
butterﬂy. while Putnam took
the 5|] and 100 freestyle last
year. However, the Bucs are
now injury plagued.

Lawrence has good balance,
but will depend mainly upon
Dick 3 n y d e r, breaststroke
champion, and Dan Foster.
diving titlist. Other potential
point winners are Pete Eetzer
and Walt Isaac.

With Dale Heimblich in the
distance freestyle races, Al
Snyder in the backstroke, and
Joel Auble coming on in the in-
dividual m e d l e y, Monmouth
could surprise a few in their
own pooll A leading diver is

 

John Harvey.

 

Cbatlengers for first division
are Cornell and Grinnell, The
Rams will be strong in both re-
lays and have top entrants with
Bob Reimers, Dave Wilkinson,
Phil Gibbs, Jack Bonaker, and
Doug Kirkpatrick Grinnell‘s
main hopes ride with its big
four, Ralph Pray, Tony Hor-
ton, Howard Schein, and John
Kraai, who has bettered the
league mark in the breast-
stroke.

Knox has only one letterman
back, Tod Brown, who was
third in diving and the 200 but-
terfly, but could get points
from Jim Johnson in the indi-
vidual medley. St. Olaf's main
threat is Erik Lokensgard, one
of the best in the backstroke.
Weak in numbers, Coe could
move up in the standings if
Bruce Hop continues his line
performances in the freestyle
sprints.

Trying to close out the sea-
son on a winning note, the Pio-
neers go on the road this weelo
end against Knox and Mon
month. Tonight the Scarlet
plays the Siwash at Galesburg
and Saturday take on the Scots
in the league finale.

Grinnell has already downed
Knox twice this year, once by a
recordrbreaking 10240 margin
at home and again in the U. of
Chicago Holiday Tourney cham-
pionship game, 64-61. Since
then, however, the Siwash have
picked up and are currently in
4th place in the MCAC and
sporting one of the league‘s
best offensive averages, 31.4
points per game. Earlier this
season. they rolled up 118, 106
and 105 points in three conse-
c u t i v e conference games.
Strangely enough, Knox has no
one in the league's top 14 scor-
ers. They rely on four men—
Jeff Sandburg, Brandon Piper,
Doug Ziech and Dave Wotring—
who average in double figures
and give Coach Harlan Knosh-
er just about the most balanced
offense in the circuit.

Monmouth surprised Knox
last weekend 61-55. but it
wasn't enough to lift the Scots
out of the conference cellar.
Possessing only four wins, one
of which was an 83779 upset
over ‘Grinnell, Monmouth relies
mainly on the scoring of Gary
Gilliland, Whose 19.3 average
puts him seventh in league
scoring. Gilliland also gets
plenty of support from Harold
Rathgeb and Dick Rodgers. The
Scots are currently ranked
among the top ten teams na-
tionally in free throw percent-
age, a fact which was instru-
mental in the win over Knox.
The Illinois crew hits well from
the floor in addition, netting H
of their first 17 shots earlier
this year at Darby Gym.

Coach John Pfitsch plans to
start the same lineup he used
last Weekend and in the loss at
Cornell on Tuesday. Plitsch had
a great deal of praise for the
spirit of the team in the last
few games and singled out
Randy Morgan for special
mention. Morgan, a reserve
most of the year, started at for-

Girls Team Wins
Basketball Game
Against Wm. Penn

By Nancy Gromko

The girls’ basketball team
fought their way to a 53-22 vic-
tory last Saturday over William
Penn, with Sandy Hoth, cap-
tain, scoring a high 32 points.

Miss Hoth was solidly backed
by the 7 other members of the
team; Anne Campbell, Jane
Smith, Marty Dixon, Sue Drie-
l-laus, Le Anne Hoepner, Jean
Watson, and Anita Freer

“it was the ﬁrst time we

- worked together as a team,”
Sandy stated The girls, who
practice an hour and a half
twice a week, usually play half
court against each other.

The Grinnell-Penn contest,
refereed by one girl from each
school, was forced to compete
with a varsity game going on at
the same time, "but. We’ve had
some pretty good crowds in the
past," Commented Sandy. ”The
boys who watch come in with
the idea that it's all a big joke,
but after they’ve been there
ten minutes they’re yelling as
loud as the rest of us.”

The girls’ basketball team,
“open to any girl who enjoys
playing the game," is under
the supervision of physical edu-
cation instructor, Miss Sandra
Leake. “The team this year,”
according to Sandy, “was or
ganized by some of us who,
having played previous years,
got together and started prac-
tlcing.“

“Penn will probably be our
only game this year," the cap-
tain stated. “The interim 5e5r
sion breaks up our schedule so
we don’t usually get to playing
other schools until well into the
second semester. Next year
we’re going to start practicing
during the interim session. This
will give us a Whole month of
actual playing.”

“We’re encouraging more
girls to participate," she ad-
ded. “it’s a lively game and a
good study break—a great way
to let off steam.”

Oldest rival on Penn
State's basketball schedule is
Bucknell. They first met in
1896.

Pioneer Wrestlers
Compile 7-1 -I Mark

The Pioneer wrestlers ended
their dual match season last
weekend with victories over
Knox and Monmouth to give
the grapplers a 7-11 mark, the
finest record compiled in recent
years by a Grinnell wrestling
team. The Pioneers’ only defeat
came at the hands of St, Olaf
1846.

The Siwash of Knox had
only three varsity wrestlers,
tail of whom were defeated
by their Grinnell opponents.
A: 130 lbs. Ken Strubler
downed Nelson, 4-]. Strubler
was followed by Al Mac-
Knight who, in his best match
of the season, edged Hal
Harrison, 3-2, on riding time.
At 191 lbs. Grinnell’s mucn
improved Marty Ringo de-
feated Murdock 5-2. The final
score, including the six for-
feits, Was an.

The following day the mat-
men took on undefeated Mon-
mouth and spoiled their perfect
record by the more of 18-16.
Jeff Lewis, 167 lbs., recorded
Grinnell’s only pin in 618‘ Lew-
is’ pin was the deciding factor
in the meet.

At 123 lbs. Bill Barnes won
easily, NJ, and was followed
by Struhler who managed to tie
highly-touted Erion, 4-4. At 137
lbs. Al MacKnight lost to a
tough opponent. 4-1. Keri Cly»
mer followed MacKnight, made
two mistakes, and lost, 64.

C0»captain Will Van Horne

Trackmen Favored to Take Meet,
Have Bulk of Point Winners Back

The Grinnell College, with
the bulk of their point. winners
returning, is the top choice to
win its third straight Univerv
sity of ChicagOvMidwest Con-
ference indoor track meet in
Chicago tomorrowi

A quartet of Juniors who
make up a crack mile relay
outfit — Ron Schachel, Jeri

Langham, John TePaske, and
Bruce Beckord — lead Grin-
nell. Schachel and TePaske
are the sprinters, with Lang-
ham Ind Beckord the middle
distance aces. In the field,
Jim Miller, a ’saphomore
weight man, is the main
threat.

Expected to put the most
pressure on Grinnell are Mon-
mouth end Beloit. Monmouth,

a team of unknown quality, will
send a highly rated group of
sophomores, winners of the
freshman meet last year, plus
Jim Whalan and Doug Carlson,
two of me better distance men,
and Bob Tucker, a Speedster.

Eeloit, short on numbers, has
returning placers in Mik e
Wolfe, Craig Heiser, and Reed
McNeal, in addition to some
top flight sophomores, John
Schmid, Fred Sattler, Mike
Clary, Tim Corcoran, Alan
Goldberg, and Nic Noell.

Right behind these two come
Carleton, Cornell, and Law«
rence. Carleton appears to be
the toughest in (the field with
John Thiel, shot winner, and
Scott Harrison. a pole vaulterr
Scott Reinertson is a favorite in
both hurdle runs.

Cornell has one of the best
high jumpers in Mike Creigh-
ton, plus a good distance man
in Jim Jamison. Dick Landic
and Bill Trench are the Rams‘
best in the sprints. Lawrence,
hard hurt by graduation losses,
still has Dave Erainard and
Henry Rutz for the dashes, and
Bob Pepper for the pole vault.

Coe will depend mainly upon
To ny McCoy, one of the
league's best hurdlers for tho
past three years. St, Olaf hopes
for points from Dave Draheim
in the broad jump and Rod
Skoge, Warren Funk, and Jim
Heimarck on the track

Even though most of the con-
ference members participate,
this is not an official Midwest
Conference meet.

 

Matmen Challenge Cornell for Conference Crown
Picked to Place Second Ill Journey To Wisconsin

The Pioneer wrestlers travel
to Beloit, Wisconsin, this week-
end, in hopes of capturing the
conference crown from its per-
ennial holder Cornell. The Pio-
neers look strong heading into
the meet, though most coaches
are picking them to battle St.
Olaf for the second spot.

Coach Edd Bowers refuses
to accept this judgment and
gives the Pioneers a real
fighting chance for the top
spot. The grapplers have an
unprecedented 7-1-1 record in
dual matches and three re-
turning conference champions
in Will Van Horne, Larry

Miller, and Morgan Michel.

Miller is undefeated this year

and Van Home has a good

chance to repeat at 147 lbs.

His strongest opponent will
be Olson of Cornell.

Bowers is also pinning his
hopes on 130 pounder Ken
Strubler who has a near pereict
record. However, this division
will be among the toughest int
the Conference with Cornell,“
Monmouth and Beloit as well asr

 

Grinnell entering good men.

HERE

 

Jeff Lewis at 177 lbs. could
come through with top honors,
though he will have very tough
competition from Schmidt of
St. Olaf and Hrouda of Cornell.
both of whom have beaten him
earlier this season.

Marty Ringo, at 191 lbs.. and
Morgan Michel at heavyweight,
are definite dark horses. Ringo
has improved greatly and could
surprise the conference. Mi-
chel, deiending conference
champion, has been pinned
by three conference rivals but
tends to look better in tourna-
ments. Al MacKnight at 137
lbs., took third place last year
and could repeat. He was very
impressive last week" against
Harrison of Knox.

The conference meet promr
ises to be atbattle royal with
Monmouth, St. Olaf and Grin-
nell vying with a weakened Cor-

nell team. Tournament competi-
tion tends to be completely if-
ferent from regular competition
and the Pioneers should have
a good tournament teamr Last
year the grapplers had a fair
dual match record, but they
surprised the conference with
a second spot.

The Rams have two of lhl
5 e v e n returning individual
champions in Don Brown (123)
and Ron Zemke, a l30-p0under
last year who will probably be
at 137 this year, Contenders in-
clude Rocky Flint (130), Lee
Olson (147), Dick Wilkes (167),
and Bob Becker (hwt.).

St. Olaf has one winner back,
Dave Schmidt (177), who ha!
beaten both Lewis, and Cot»
nell's challenger. Dave Hrov
da. The Oles will also get points
out of Ed Rundell (123) and Al
MDen. '

Cartoonist Coplivoies Audience —
Draws. Talks. Jokes at Lecture

By Pam Clay

r “My normal working day
starts at the office at 9:00—
just in time to take a coffee
break at Bishops," said Frank
Miller, cartoonist for The Des
Moines Register and Tribune.
“1 try to return to the office
in Lime to leave for lunch; then
I go back and draw for about
two hours!" Mr. Miller said
that this ”daily schedule" does
point up one important thing
about editorial cartoonists, “To
{lave an idea one must have
omething to say; 90% of the
work and time is getting ideas."

Mr. Miller was graduated
from the University of Kansas
with a degree in fine arts. He
went on to study at the Ram
Ens City Art institute. He came
to Des Moines about ten years
ago after working on the Kan<
ﬂas City Star.

To prove that his artistic tal-
Dnts have never been ignored,
Mr. Miller explained how he

ainted everything possible dur-

g his five year stint with
Uncle Sam. What artistic cre<
Btion it took to stencil names
on thousands of helmets, to
stencil stripes, oak leaves, and
stars for the officers; the air
Iorce (unofficially) even do-
manded pin-up girls on the
noses of their planesl ”The
armed forces have this neces-
sity called a latrine, and every
time we moved I painted a sign
“LATRINE CLOSED OUTi"
.Why, my art work is in Ger-
many, France, Korea . . .1”

Mr. Miller used visual aids
to the best advantage through-
out his lecture. The first car-
toon he drew showed the typi-
cal image of a cartoonist: be-
ret, long hair, sunglasses, and
landals. He has received vari-
ous comments about his career
such as: “You don’t look like
one,” ”You actually make a
living doing that?” and, “Why

 

don’t you say something fun»
ny?"

He demonstrated some typi-
cal commercial cartoons and
then gave his own version— en-
tirely different but much more
truthfull Mr. Miller said his
cartoons are drawn “the way
I see life"

“The editorial cartoonist gets
lots of help from world lead-
ers." he said. To illustrate his
point he mentioned Castro’s
beard and boots, and Johnson‘s
ranch and hat.

The beginning of a cartoon of
Khrushchev was guessed by
sophomore Phil Bernstein. He
got to keep the original but per-
haps guessed a little too soon;
all he got was one line indicat~
ing a bald crown.

Mr. Miller said that he and
other cartoonists have been at-
tacked by members of the John
Birch society because “humor
is a luxury we cannot afford in
th e s e terrible times.” He
claimed that Americans have
always had humor and that it
is now a necessity. Paul Revere
and Benjamin Franklin were
the first American editorial car-
toonists. but even the cave
drawings. which record how
people lived, are editorial car<
toons, he pointed out.

Mr. Miller’s technique is the
old-fashioned one of pen and ink
9“ smooth paper; he is not tech-
nically correct but feels free to
dream up his own images of a
locomotive, character, or set-
ting. ”We must think, read, lis-
ten. and then speak and act,’
he said. ”Everyone must do
this, not only the cartoonists
and reporters. In Russia the
press is a tool of propaganda—
it can happen here.”

Reading from former Pres-
dent Kennedy’s tribute to Rob»
ert Frost, Mr. Miller quoted,
". . . art established the basic
human truths. . ."

”Drawing cartoons is a job
I love; I can’t think of any-
thing I would rather do."
