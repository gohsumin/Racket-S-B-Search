urday and Sunday. the Board
of Trustees announced the
election of two new members
and the resignation of another,
discussed a raise in the com-
prehensive fee, and met with
various members of the col»

FacultyAbolishes Comp Requirement

By a vote of 62-14, the iaculty
Monday abolished the long-
standing general grnduation re-
quirement that seniors must
pass a comprehensive examina-
tion in their major field of
study. In doing so, the faculty
also voted to allow individual
departments to institute alterna
tive programs such as seminars
or research projects. to replace
the old requirement.

However, it majors are re-
quired to pass the departmental
programs in order to graduate.
the new requirements must
have the recommendation of the
Diviisional Educational Policy
Committee (EPC) and the ap-
proval oi the Faculty Executive
Council.

Students presently enrolled
may choose to satisiy either
new mandatory departmental
programs or the old compre-
hensive examination require-
ment.

The tacuity acted on the mo»
tion after extended debate on
the matter at its Oct. 27 meete
ing. Monday's debate was de-
voted to minor changes in word-
ing of an amendment offered by
Asst. Prof. John H. Worley
(Philosophy) that will allow for
the departmental replacement
of the comp requirement.

However, before the secret
ballot vote was taken, Prol.
John R. Kleinschmidt (French),
chairman of the faculty, sum-
marized the pro and con argu-
ments regarding comps by read-
ing from the minutes of the Ex-
ecutive Council meeting at
which comps were discussed.
The Executive Council last
month divided evenly on the
comp issue, with tive members
favoring abolition and live oth-
ers opposed.

Numerous departments this
week began preliminary discuse
Sions about the possibility of es—
tablishing replacement pro
grams for seniors presently en-
rolled.

The text of the approved
motion on comps:

“The college requirement
that seniors must take and
pass a comprehensive exam-
ination in their major field be
abolished, effective for the
class of 1970.

“Any department may re-
place the present college grad
nation requirement by institub
ing a program which is pain
of its course structure or in ad-
dition to its course structure.
Such a program could consist
of a comprehensive examina-
tion, a thesis or paper, a par-
ticular course or seminar, 3
research project, a public per-
formance, or any combination
of these. These programs may
be either optional or required
within a major ﬁeld, but it
passing the departmental pro~
gram is required for gradua-
tion in that major field, then
such a program must be re«

parted with recommendation
by the Divisional EPC to the
Executive Council and our
proved by that body.

“As such a requirement
within a major field is not a
new requirement, but a re-
placement for the present col-
lege graduation requirements,
all students now enrolled in
the college who choose to ma-
im- in those departments which
adopt mandatory programs,
will have the option of satisfy-
ing the departmental program
or passing the present form of
comprehensive examination.”

in other action Monday, the
iaculty debated about how it
should recognize luture Viet-
nam Moratoriums. President
Glenn Leggett predicted that ii
the faculty continues its Octoe
ber policy of "procedural flexi-
bility” (whereby taculty and
students were not penalized for
missing classes), there will be
“serious operational diiiicul~
ties,” especially during the
three—day December Morato-
rium which will coincide with
ilnal examinations

Moratorium action was too in-

include leatletting the high

that freshman students would

Slutbnls Plan
To March In 0.6.

Over 70 Grinnell students are
presently making plans to par-
ticipate in a massive anti~war
demonstration in Washington on
November 15. The students
were given a substantial boost
Tuesday night when the student
senate allocated $200 to help
pay for bus transportation.

The Washington demon-
stration is being planned by the
New Mobilization Committee to
End the War In Vietnamr Al-
though the march is planned
to coincide in part with the
November Vietnam Morator-
ium, organizers point out that
the two activities are not
directly related.

Two major activities are
planned at the present, a mass
march on Saturday, to be pre-
ceded by a March Against
Death that will begin Thursday
night and continue throughout
the day Friday During the
March Against Death, which
will originate in Arlington
National Cemetery, protestors
representing the 46,000
Americans killed in Vietnam
will march single file across the
Potomac River, past the White
House, to the Capitol. As
marchers pass the White House.
they will call out the name of
the dead G! they represent, his
name being borne on a placardi
The placards will be deposited
at the capitol.

The Saturday march, behind
the demand ”U.Si Get Out oi
Vietnam," will begin with a
rally on the Mall, a large
grassy area near the Capitol.
The demonstration will then
move down Pennsylvania Ave.
around the White House, and
conclude With a rally on the
Ellipse, a park located behind
the White House.

The main body of the Grinnell
contingent is planning to leave
by bus Friday nrternoon,
participate in the Saturday
march, and then depart Satur-
day night. The anticipated cost
will be set per person, although

Gadabouls Head Weston ls
criticized For Danae Goals

In a controversy that develr
oped lollowing last month's
Homecoming dance, the prin—
cipal locus of student com-
plaints has been the fact that
Gadahouls Chairman Ernest
Weston paid students a total of
also to decorate Darby Gym-
nasium.

“We just couldn’t find volun-
teers to do the wor ," said
Weston, who is also president
of the Council of House Presi-
dents. “The students were
paid the regular student wage
of $1.30 per hour." Weston
said he had time and wage
figures for all the student
workers if anyone wanted to
see them.

Social Coordinator Jon Stein
told the 58:3 he felt the mat-
ter had been poorly handled,
but pointed out that not just
Weston, “but the whole social
coordinating committee has
had problems ﬁnding people to
work. If a job has to be done
and nobody volunteers to do
it, then you have to pay to
have it done.”

Stein said that his principal
objection, as well as that of
many other students, was the
way in which the students 7
nearly all of them friends of
Weston — were hired. “In the
future, if we decide that Stu-
dents will have to be paid, we
will hire them through the
regular student placement
service," he said.

In previous years, students
have not been paid for dec-

.orating Darby, although stu-
dents who have worked during
the dance itself received a
wage. On occasion student
workers were invited to a
party, which seldom exceeded
330 in cost.

Gommillee Meeting

The Student Affairs Commit-

addition to the regular COI‘rtmliT

was distributed.

Eighteen schools, not all

these schools have systems ree
quiring students to show meal
cards or ID cards at meals,
The majority of the schools
have no special options for

The committee feels students
must realize that runner op

more than the present full

will be considerll'lg various
options after costs have been
estimated. Student opinion Will
be soliclted.

At last week’s SAC meeting,

possibilities for a statement on

The Senate passed the
IoIIowmg resolution concerning
the Vietnam Moratorium Nov.
1344 at its meeting Wednesday
night:

“The Grinnell
Senate resolves
members or the College —
students, faculty, ad-
ministration, and staff—cease
business as usual Nov. 13-14
in observance of the Vietnam
Moratorium.

“We believe that those
who continue bLsiness as
usual implicitly sanction our
n a 1 i o n ’ 5 continued in-
volvemont in Vietnam.

“This cessation must extend
beyond the closing of classes
to such nonessential services
or the college as the library,
the Forum, maid service, Ihe
bookstore, etc.

“The S e n a t 9. further
resalves that the College not
penalize those eniployes who
do not work Nov, 1344.”

“The Senate believes that
the College should, however,
maintain a minimal B&G
crew and the SAGA food
service.”

The Senate also passed a
motion by senior Tom Thomas
to conduct an opinion evaluation
referendum on the substance of
the Senate resolution.

In Student Power news, the
heralded Student P o s i t i o n
Paper went to the printers cn
Wednesday, and is due for dis-
tribution to the entire campus.
The big Senate meeting in
Roberts Theater next week Will
be on Tuesday or Wednesday,
depending on when the printer
can get the work done.

Last wcek several of the Com-
mittee chairmen in the Power
Movement were ccntacted by
Presidcht Leggett and invited
to a meeting with the Executive
Council. The students responded
by inviting the council to a
meeting that they called. and
at the meeting lniormed the
Executive Council that they
were not prepared to speak for
the student body, and couldn’t
say anything about the Fashion
Paper until it was released and
approved by the student Senate
with the student body in at-
tendance at a mass meeting.

Charge ‘Anti-Freak' Bias
In local Restaurant Firing

By ida Gudenia
Freda Tepter, a former Grin»

because of discrimination based

According to her account,
Miss Tepfer was hired as a

believes, “is what is appros
priate for one’s own needs and
the society one lives in”) he
holds that “man must live
within his own skin,” rather
than constantly striving for
what he ought to be, as tra-

“Such ‘now’ oriented people

McCiirty’s only comments on
seeing the house were, “That’s
very nice; they left the lights
on.”

The next morning, Miss Tep-
ier awoke to iind a message
instructing her to call the
McCurry’s. When she did, Gene
McCurry, the owner, informed
her that her “hours had been
terminated“ and she could pick
up her pay in cash. When she
asked for a reason, he said,
‘it’s your environment, the way
you live."

Two ‘89 Grinnell graduates,
Krystyna Neuman and Jim
Rudolph, accompanied Miss
Tepier to the cafe. McCurry
saitl he had already sent the
check in the mail, so he and
his eXremployee went back to
the kitchen to discuss the mat-
ter. At this time. Miss Neuman
tried to take a picture of them
from the front oi the cafe.
McCurry moved out of the
camera’s View, and came
towards Miss Neuman with
what she described as a “really
vicious look on his face." He
tried to talte the camera irom
her. Another employee came to
help him, but Miss Neuman
wouldn’t let go. They finally
managed to force her outside;
Miss Neuman said she noticed
her hand was bleeding when the
scuttle was over. Rudolph had
also been bodily removed item

That night, Miss repier
ieceived about ten threatening
phone calls, some saying that
the next person stepping out of
the house would get his head
blown off. There was also a
call supposedly irom Mayor
Floyd Beaver, telling her to
come to the police station imr
medialely. She did so, but no
one was there to meet her. The
police also came to the Gallery
because of the threats, but
found no one on the grounds.
Miss Tepier thougnt all the
calls were made by one man,
and said he mispronounced her
name in the same way McCurry
did.

On Wednesday, Miss Neuman
tiled assault and battery
charges against McCurry and
his employee, Opel Swatosh.
Rudolph filed the same charges
against Opel Swatosh.

On Oct. 31, Miss Tepier went
to Des Moines to file a com
plaint with the Iowa Civil
Rights Commission, charging
discrimination on the basis of
Creed. This week an investi»
gator {rpm the Commission
came to Grinneil to talk to
McCurry and Miss Tepler
separately. Miss Tepfer expects
the case to go on for about
a year, after which she may
get her job or some money
back.

in Commenting on the inci-
dent, Miss Tepier said, “One
thing I've learned is that people
in town tolerate freaks if they
are taking money from you, but
it it's the other way, they’re

she assumes she can't get

First, she said, “townpeople

Committee to coordinate the

In addition to the scheduled
activities, actions are also being
planned by a militant “red ﬂag
contingent.” The radical group
is being formulated by a coali-
tion including the Black Pane
ther Party, the Committees
Against Fascism, Youth Against
War and Fascism, the Commit-
tee of Returned Volunteers,
Yippies, and various factions of
SDS.

Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hotl-
man, two of the defendants in
the “Conspiracy 8" trial, are
expected to participate in the
Washington action.

Plans at the present call for
a march on the headquarters
of the Department of Justice
with demands oi “Stop the
Trial” (or the Conspiracy 8)
and ”Free All Political
Prisoners.” A march on the
“Injustice Department” will
tollow the mass march on Sat-
urday. During the mass march,
members of the “red flag con»
tingent” wrll march together
carrying red ilags, Viet Cong
flags, and banners showing
solidarity with the Vietnamese
people.

The planning for the radical
faction, was begun at a meeting
in Newark, N. 1., with much
oi the impetus coming from the
newly formed “Mad Dog"
caucus of SDS which supports
neither the Weatherman or
RYMVII factions. Although
RYM—II is expected to par-
ticipate in the Washington
action, Weatherman as yet has
not been involved.

All plans tor Washington are
tentative as the 5&3 goes to
press, pending the securing of
parade permits and the con-
firmation Of final arrange-
ments.

The Justice Department has
so for denied a permit for the
Saturday march, fearing vio-
lence while the “White House
is surrounded."

Thursday night (Oct. 30) in
Herrick Chapel, and the hapr
pening was staged by Jacob
Margolin, a New Jersey sopho-
more, who took a microphone
in the questionrandranswer ses-
sion that followed Barnes’
speech and lambasted the
“Pig” of American foreign
policy.

Barnes appeared under the
auspices of the International
Studies Program, and was
seated with a panel composed
of iacuity members Alan Nas—
ser (Phil), Terry Farssinen
(History), and Jolln Guthrie
(Diplomat-in-Residence), along
with F, W. (“Tommy”) Toma-
sek, a local attorney. From
the panel members, as well as
the students. came the chal—
lenges to the facticity of the
utficial’s analyses of American
presence in the Far East, as
well as to his predictions for
the future in Vietnam. His
official topic was “Vietnam ~
Present and Future.”

The program began with
Barnes' general analyses of
the political and economic Sltllr
ations of those Southeast Asian
countries with which Barnes
was most familiar from his
service in Bien Long in Viet-
nam, and his current position
as "country officer” in Laos
with the State Department’s
Bureau of East Asian Affairs.

His descriptions of the ”rich
ness” of each of the countries
he touched on later served to
introduce the question oi
American economic motives in
interfering with the internal
affairs of each of the countries.

Before Nasser introduced
this problem, the town attor-
ney scored Barnes in the words
of an old Walter Lippman col»
umn on the dangers of Ameri-
can intervention in a country
"reasonably beyond our sphere
of influence.” Barnes replied
that America would have to be
more careful of its use of
power in the future (after
Vietnam), “because it makes
good sense.”

Speaking while a student
held a viet Cong tlag througlir
out the program and the ques-
tion-andanswer session that
followed it, the official replied
to points Nasser raised about

the affairs of thirdrworld (and

by saying that he did not think
that the U.S. was in Vietnam
“for tungsten and tin," and
that he did, in fact believe,
there was a certain moral im»

Commenting later in the pro
gram that he said he did not
regard the American interven
tion as necessarily immoral or
unjust, for one reason, he said,
because “President Nixon has
clearly enunciated a policy of
withdrawal."

State Department official po-
sition appeared to enter into
Barnes’ views on the history or
the Viet Cong and the relative
power of the National Libera-
tion Front in South Vietnam;
both views were hotly critir
Cized by both Nasser and Stu-
dents in the audience. Barnes
stated that the formation of
the Viet Cong dated from the
1950's, and was in fact formed
on directive from Peking, to a
counterpoint of quiet state-
ments such as “That is a lie"
from the philosophy professor.
The power of the Viet Cong,
the official stated, is broken at
the present time, although. he
conceded, it could build itself
up to its former high-water-
mark in four to iive years.

session continued. the magni-
tude and necessity of such
American sacrifices as the
“defense” of Hue were dressed
in the pragmatic‘and iinemo
tional style of Barnes expla-
nations. The State Department
official retained his dispassinnr
ate calm until the end of the
evening, however, and at one
point deflected a question on
President Nixon’s war plans
by saying, “Let's wait and see
what Mr. Nixon says on No-
vember 3."

Although it seemed evident

Barnes neither expected nor
considered possible a major
policy switch by Nixon, he
commented that the nation
might well be surprised by the
President’s remarks. However,
in the long heralded speech
delivered Monday night, Nixon
announced no major policy
changes.

To the Editor:

I would Ii e to correct the mis-
‘nformatian presented by Dean

investigations. I was involved in
the investigation because my
roommate was arrested in Chis
cago. Contrary to Dean Wall’s
statement I was not contacted

Lawrence Frank, a member

Frank to publicly state, without
any equivocation or double talk.
exactly what information he and
his lricnds “saw” pass trom the

iar, all he has done is to call
the administration’s words into

Wants Manners on Campus

To the Editor:

I would like to comment upon
the ideal of the college com-
munity and its debasement on
this campus. I conjecture that
its maltreatment is derived not
from ignorance her lack of
ideals, but egocentrism and self~
interest,

We hear news to surfeit about
the purportedly “beautiful peo.
ple;" the liberal, considerate.
nonsplastic, humanitarian, gor-
geous, groovy, wonderful, lov-
able person. And. supposedly,
there should he a very largo
number of such beings on this
very campus. Many people
staunchly maintain that there
are; l staunchly maintain that
the only things that are beauti.
Iul around here are perhaps the
trees and maybe a dog and a
squirrel here and there,

so I’ll qualify: or the large num-
ber of people i have met on the
Gnnnell College campus. 1 have
round perhaps one or two in the
entire community who could be
considered even remotely po-
tentially “beautiful," Note. I say
potentially. (I can just hear my
“friends” saying, “He must
mean me")

The foundations of my argu
ment stem from small ann0y~
ances, which in gestalt build to
create fissional iorces rather
than cohesive ones and are thus
detrimental to the college com.
nunity as well as contributing
to the “ugliness” of many indi.
viduals . .

dering on violent nausea incl-

selfishness in the dorms. intra-

to stand in meal Lines without
closing my eyes so that 1 don’t
have to see all of the people
doing all their little obnoxious
shticks with the added annoys
ance of asininc “jock” cuts. Al-
50, I have vowed not to partici.
pate in intramural sports due
to already bad experiences.
Some of these affronts have
been personal but most have a
generally prismatic eliect on
the community as a whole. 0th-
er manifestations of this sub
eretan moronic behavior are ob-
servable in the broken iorum

college property which is, in
actuality, our property that is
being destroyed by the very
pteople (us) who are paying for

The popular generic term
“ego trip” very adequately ex.
presses a major cause of this
entire problem. You don’t have
to be socialistic to be at least
a little humanistic and sincerely
considerate. I say sincerely con-
siderate; attectatlon does not
belong here. We can do nicell
without pseudodiberalism. But,
if everyone would just still
maintain their individuality on
a less obnoxious level, condi.

Bring 'Em Home
To the Editor:

Many of my college friends and
fellow countrymen are probably
11 under the false assumpv

n that President Nixon plans
to end our military commitment
in Vietnam and abolish the
Present draft System The ar-
rival of my induction notice on
24 Oct, 1969 awakened me to
the fact that the United States
population has been consuming
a steady stream or propaganda
concerning these issues for the
last few months. at least.

After three months of job
hunting. both through employ-
ment agencies and individually,
it became apparent that most
employers are extremely hesi—
tant about hiring 17A college
graduates. When Nixon an-
nounced that troop withdrawals
from Vietnam made it possible
to spread the induction of those
men on the October Call over
November and December and
cancel the calls for these later
two months, I approached my
local board and was informed
that I would not be threatened
with induction until after the
first of the year. I decided to
seek temporary employment to
await what I thought would he
a rapidly coming announcement
that the draft system had been
drastically modified. I was giv.
en a job in a local US. Post Oir
[ice and proceeded to make a
tow charge purchases, i now find
myself in a bind to pay my
debts before my induction on 12
Nov. 1969, My local board said
that they too were surprised to
receive orders for a November
call. They also mentioned that

the call was the largest in sev-
eral months.

It is time that the American
people is given the truth by its
government. I urge you to do
everything in your power to in.
fluente congressmen and other
elected officials. Let's get all
of our representatives striving
to end the war in Vietnam,
the present Selective System,
and the steady stream oi mi n-
formation ilowing from the or.
(ice of the President of the
United States. it is not in the
least hard to understand why
many of my contemporaries
want revolution. They and 1
both hope for a totally tree and
equal world where all men are
treated as individual humans
rather than numbers, While this
totally irec world is impossible
without a third world war,
there is no valid reason that
the United States can not be.
some more free and humane.
Only an actively concerned pub.
lic can put an end to the in-
human treatment of our mi i.
tary system, No longer is it
realistic for the us. to try to
protect the rest at the world
irom communist aggression.
Now is the time to bring our
men home where they belong to
help make our country a better
place to live and work.

luegrass Singer ilere Saturday Night

By Ron Stanford

Direct from the Grand Ole
Opry of Nashville, Ell] Monv
too and the Bluegrass Boys
will be in Grinnell’s South
Lounge tomorrow night at 9
pin. Monroe, who has been a
top attraction in the Grand
Ole opry since 1939. is widely
recognized as the originator
of bluegrass music.

Throughout the twenties and
thirties the music which later
cyclverl into bluegrass was
known as “string band mus
sic,” usually played with a
guitar, fiddle, ‘and banjo.
Monrcc started playing pro-
tcssionally in the early 1930’s
with his brothers Charley and
Birch. In 1938, he split with
his brother Charley and form-
ed the now famous Bluegrass
Boys

Monroe developed a com-
pletely new style oi music that
incorporated the traditional
music oi the string band and
a more driving sound, the
lead being taken by the iiddle,
banjo, and mandolin. The
mandolin is Monroe‘s instru»
ment. By the early 1940’s the
world of country music had
adopted the term bluegrass
music from the name at Mon
roe’s group.

Bill Monroe's band has been
considered the training ground

ior many a country music
star. Perhaps the most famous
musicians who performed with
Monroe were Lester Flatt and
Earl Scruggs. it was during
his stay with the Bluegrass
Boys that Earl Scruggs de-
Veloped his unique style of
banjo finger-picking. Other
notables who have performed
with Monroe include Don
Reno, Mack Wiseman, Bill
Keith, and Del McCourry.

Monroe has been one at the
most influential forces in conn-
tiy music. When the imporr
tance of string band music be
gan to wane as electrified
country music gained pupils
larity, Monroe gave a new life
to unamplliied string band
music.

Monroe has remained true to
his musical principles through
out his career and has con
tributed an incredible number
oi musical compositions.
Among his best known works
are “Footprints in the Snow,“
“1 Hear 3 Sweet Voice Callv
inst" "Uncle Pen,” “Roar
noke," and the “Blue Moon at
Kentucky.”

Monroe, born in Rosene,
Kentucky, attributes the ideas
for his music to many sources.
The song “Uncle Pen,” for ex-
ample, was written in mem-
cry or his fiddlerplaying uncle
who ﬁrst taught him the tra-

dltional mountain iiddlc tunes.
Monroe also learned much
from Arnold Schultz, a black
guitarist who played at dances
in the Rosene area.

The importance of Monroe’s
music has been recognized by
many. This summer both the
State of Kentucky and the
Smithsonian institution honor-
ed Monroe for his contribution
to American music.

By Sue Siege]

Football game halftime ac~
tivities last Saturday were hi-
lighted by a head-butting
contest between junior
“Penguin” Dave Feldman, and
sophomore Jim Demopulos,
better known as “The Fox."

Penguin Dave and The Fox,
both members of Grinnells 0b
Squad cheering section, claimed
to have Set the new world
record at 690 head butts.
Previously Feldman and
Demopulos claimed to have
held the world record of 150
butts, set during the first home
football game oi this season.

The Fox explained head»
butting as something that “Has
to be experienced.” The best
d iptlon this reporter could
give would be two people
literally putting their heads
together.

The contest began about live
minutes into halftime in the
section of the stands occupied
by the 0b Squad. 0b Squad
members encouraged both
butters by keeping count of the
number ol times their heads
cluliked together, and a base
drum helped to keep the
rhythm.

”The last butt was just as
exciting as the first,” explainr
ed Penguin Dave when the
butting contest was over. “It
could have gone on forever,”
agreed the Fox.

Both men and women can
par lolpale in head butting, The
Fox revealed. "It's a give and
take experience, a new form
of communication. There is no
physical pain involved; in fact
it‘s one of the most ecstatic
feelings one can have. It’s a
mutal experlence that is best
enjoyed when the two people
are willing to give equally of
themselves.”

Both butters are considering
entering the record in the .
“Guinness Book of World
Records.” but had not yet come
to a decision.

activity, The Fox replied,
“Why? Cause it was there”

Head-butting could be just the
answer President Nixon is
looking for. The Fox stated his
position as “I think if everyone
took time to head-butt, we
would have all the world
problems solved.”

Just imagine Richard Nixon
butting heads with Jerry Rubin!

Asked why he had chosen to
engage in headrbutting, The
Fox smiled. placed his hand on
his head, and replied:

“Why? Because it

Tom Hayden, Bobby Seale Give Views On Trial

(John Froines, a member
of the “Conspiracy 8" pres-
ently on trial in Chicago, will
be on the Grinnell campus
tomorrow. Earlier this week,
two other members of the
Conspiracy, Tom Hayden
and Bobby Seale, released
statements on the current
progress of the trial. Por-
tions of those statements are
printed below.)

Hayden: We came to Chi-
cago last year because we
were living under a system
that did not represent us, that
was culturally and politically
meaningless, and l think that
we have now been vindicated
as prophets.

The war in Vietnam still
goes on. President Nixon has
carried on the policies of
President Johnson. President
Nixon in fact has used John-
son’s very words in condemn-
ing and ignoring the anti-war
sentiment.

This is what we were pro-
testing last year when We said
that we have no role in this,
that this had no meaning to
us — there is no real choice
for the American people. And
when Hubert Humphrey at the
time of the Moratorium be—
came the man to endorse Rich»
ard Nixon’s policy, it all came
through in the clearest and
simplest way: for here were
the same men who we said
represented no choice last
year. now endorsing each
other and trying to carry on
policies of last year.

The people who came to the
streets of Chicago last year
were prophetic about which
way this country was going —
how long it was going to con-
tinue the war, how it was go
ing to treat black people, how
it was going to treat young
people — and now i think we
see the same process recur-
ring in the courtroom that oc-
curred last year around the
Convention.

The government attack on
Bobby Scale, on myself and
omer people in the courtroom
follows the same line that
their attack followed last year
around the Convention. There
was a vivid demonstration of
the way the government deals

with facts, deals with evi—
dence. yesterday when Mr.
Schultz summarized in his
own selective way what Bobby
Seale had said in the morning.
Bobby Seale came into the
courtroom, said that he was
standing on his constitutional
rights, said several times that
he wanted people in the audi-
ence to keep cool no matter
what happened, they said they
would, and then later, when
Bobby was thrown back in his
seat Schultz got up, told the
judge that Bobby Seale had
earlier told people in the audi-
ence to be ready to make an
“attack."

it was only after our in»
sistence — we almost had to
scream our insistence — that
that was not the case. that
Schultz, since he was before a
stenographer, had to back
down and acknowledge that
there was something else that
Bobby said.

Life Magazine was very pro»
phetic when it said that this
was not so much a trial as
an act of vengeance because
men go mad when they know
they have lost. and Judge
Hoffman knows that he has
lost. the social order that he
represents is finished. The so»
cial order that President Nix-
on and Vice President Agnew
represent is finished.

That's what is going on and
I think it's going to get worse.
i think now, the quieter we
are , . . the more that we are
respectiul. the more that we
simply sit there in the room,
the more outraged and frus-
trated and boiling they will
become. The process is now
simply underway. Whether we
scream or whether we are si-
lent, it will go from one step
to the next until the entire
trial disintegrates, This is a
prediction, it is not a threat.

Seale: Why am I handcuiled,
shackled to a chair, and
gagged in Judge Hoiiman’s
United States District of Illi-
ndis courtroom? i am sure
the masses of Americans, es-
pecially the Black People, are
intelligent enough to see the
injustice irom the very begin-
ning of this trial as a railroad-
ing operation of US. imperial-

ism abroad and domestic im»
perialism — fascism — here
at home. We should know that
racism plus capitalism breeds
fascism; but, we see how the
newspapers and especially the
TV and radio news media try
to say or imply that the rea
son I was shackled and gagged
was because ol what this pig
Judge calls outbursts or “in-
terrupting the court proceed-
ings.”

The masses oi working
people (the employed and un—
employed Black and poor op-
pressed people) can see fur
ther than that. And those who
cannot and/or those who are
coniused about it all can now
see the real reasons fascism
is showing its hand more open-
ly; because a man stands up
and speaks in behalf of his
constitutional rights to be rep-
resented by legal counsel of
his choosing and if not that,
then the constitutional right to
defend himself by being his
own lawyer until his ill law.
yer, who is most effective in
proving his innocence, can
come to defend him.

I have sat for hours and lis-
rened to testimony, most of
which is lies, directed against
the other seven defendants.
The only times We stood up
and demanded my right to le-
gal defense are when a wit»
ness says my name. Then I
stand up and say “I object on
the grounds that my lawyer.
Charles R. Garry, is not here,
I've been denied his services
and l have been denied the
right to defend myself, so I
object to this witness testify-
ing against me.”

Everyone knows this trial
should not be going on. Every-
one knows that constitutional
rights are being attacked by
this rotten power structure in
America.

The right to free speech and
freedom to assemble and
peacefully protest even in
court. This fascist court put
chains, handculis, and gags
on a person. What are they
really doing? WHY? what is
this?

Simple: the constitutional
laws are supposed to protect
me or any citizen in America,

Chicago—Eights Froines

Friday. November 7

To Speak Here Tomorrow

Despite the refusal of the
Program in Practical Political
Education (PPPE) to give 5100
for his appearance, John
Frames, one of Chicago’s
“Conspiracy 8,” will appear at
Grinnell tomorrow. Froines will
speak in Roberts Theatre from
3 p m. to 5 pm,

Froines is currently on trial
in Chicago with seven other
persons (or conspiracy charges
resulting from his participation
in the demonstrations at the
1968 Democratic National Cons
vention. He is a chemistry pro-
fessor at the Universrty oi
oregon, and has participated in
radical pclitical activities for
many years. During the trial,
he can only leave Chicago on
weekends. and he uses this time
to raise money lor the trial and
appeals, by speaking throughout
the country.

According to Jim Lew, SGA
president, PPPE earlier im-
pile-ﬂ it wculd help pay for
Froinc's appearance. However.
when instructor l-ienry Klein
(Art) proposed that PPPE pay
$100, the Suggestion was defeat-
cd by a 5-2 vote oi the PPPE
Advisory Committee. The Stu
dent senate had already agreed
to pay $150 to bring Froines
here, and the additional $100
will new have to be raised
through donations.

in a note to Assoc. Prof.

K i e i n, Edwin Gilmour,
(PDlitlcal Science) PPPE Dir-
ector, said, “The Committee
wanted you to know that this
action was not disapproval of
Froines’ appearance at Grin-
nell; rather, it was the judg-
ment of the Committee that this
action was not within the pro
gram jurisdiction of the PP
FE.” Klein said that he be-
lieved they thought the issues
involved were not of broad
enough importance to justiiy
the grant. Klein expressed
”amazement” at this cons
clusicn.

ln a separate action the
senate passed the following
resolution at its Tuesday meet-
ing: “Since the central question
involved in the trial of the
“Chicago 8 Conspirators” is the
use Cl the American judicial
process as a political weapon:
a question which involves us
all—and since John R. Froines,
a member of the “Chicago 8"
will be on campus Sat. Nov.
8. the senate urges the college
community to give generously
to the campus fund drive to
support the “Chicago 8.“

Tomorrow morning, Froines
will meet with chemistry
majors due to his professional
interest. Other scheduled ac-
tivities include a lunch with stu-
dents. as well as the afternoon
speech.

Bridging the Gap: College Man at 42

By Steve Otto

Poker»faced and shivering, a
gathering of Englishmen stared
up at their honorable mayor,
Thomas Middleton, who had
come 10 give a speech at the
cold, rainy dedication cere-
mony of a newlyrbuilt school-
house. At one corner of the
structure, someone had chipped
out the date: 1651.

Middleton’s eloquence didn’t
stir in a n y hearts that
day, but he uttered one line
that struck a note of immore
tality in the townspeople's reds
dening ears: “A man is never
too old to learn!"

Evidence that this maxim is
just as true today as it was
in 1651 can be found at the
Grinnell College physics work-
shop.

There, peering out from be-
hind a network of multicolored
wires and tubes, 'is the face of
Charles Fierce. Pierce, at 42,
is one of the few men of the
age who has successfully
bridged the generation gap
without the aid of a heard or
long hair. His formula: “Be-
come a student!” And as a
Grinnell College student, he
attends six hours of class a
week and holds down a full“
time job as the college‘s phys-
ics technician. With a flair for
reading schematics diagrams
and explanatory notes from
college professors, he fits right
in.

Born and raised near Brook-
lyn, Iowa, Pierce comes from
a “family of large families” as
he puts it He has five sisters
and one brother, “None of us
strayed very far from home,”
he says. “My brother, who
lives farther away than the
rest of us, resides in Kellogg."

Pierce’s mother has 29 grand-
children, and seven of them
belong to Pierce. His children
are Marcia, 15, Sheri, 14, Ste-
ven, 12, Rodney, 10, Jon, 6,
Curtis, 3, and Jodi, almost 2.
As if seven children weren’t
enough, he went out and got
himself a little league baseball
team which he coaches in the

summer. Even seven children,
the little league baseball team,
and 20 years away irbm school
have not drained his energy
and desire to learn. He attends
an astronomy class and a math
class right along with students
22 years his junior.

He has an insatiable curios-
ity, which has undoubtedly been
an asset in his rather unusual
line of work. Specifically, his
work involves setting up vari-
ous experiments and demon-
strations for physics classes,
keeping the physics depart-
ment’ vast store of delicate
equipment in proper working
order, and even building a few
intricate pieces of physics
equipment himself when protes-
sors require it He recently
completed a spectroscope, an
optical device used for forming
light spectra for study,

If you are saying to your-
self, “That type of Work sounds
as if it might get complicated
at times," you're right. For
someone who has had no for
mal education in electronics or
physics —— and who didn’t know
a cathode ray tube from an
erg when he first started —
Pierce gives a good account of
himself.

Catch him sometime
conversation with a college
physics professor, and you’ll
have a tough time trying to
decide which gentleman is
supposed to have a string of
letters after his name. The
profs rely on him for all types
of general information and ads
vice, His excellent background
as a machinist and mechanic
combined with What he has
learned in the past two years
as a physics technician make
him a good reference source.

But he scoffs when referred
to as “really, quite a bright
fellow." “You can learn a lot,”
he notes, “by osmosis e sim-
ply absorbing what you see.”

If that's the case, his mind
is a sponge for physics facts,

After graduating from high
school, he spent six years in
the Navy, worked another six

Between classes, 42-year—old Charles Pierce
sets up experiments for demonstrations by
Grinnell physics professors. While he has no
formal education in electronics or physics, he

hopes to complete Grinnell‘s college level
physics courses. He has been coordinator of
the technical aspects of the Physics Dept. for
the past two years.

 

as a lathe operator in the Vik-
ing Pump Cu, at Cedar Falls,
and until three years ago was
an automobile mechanic at a
Grinnell garage. He came to
the attention of Grinnell Col-
lege in 1967 when he was a 116'
troleum delivery salesman for
the Gulf Oil Co. His many
skills made him an attractive
candidate for the job as the
college’s physics technician.

His only regret is that he
didn’t find this job 20 years
sooner so he could have con-
tinued his education. From his
point of View, education is a
serious matter, ”not merely
because it helps you get a bet-
ter job, but also because it’s
important for a person to be
knowledgeable in many differ-
ent fields.” he says.

He’s teaching his children to
be “service minded,” which he
defines as “thinking about ca-
reers like nursing or teaching.
All of us have benefited from
others’ services,“ he points out,
“so I try to impress upon my
children that it is important for
us to return some of this serv-
ice.”

Being a 42-year-old college
student does have its prob
lems. “You can forget a lot in

20 years,” he says, 0f the two
courses he is now taking, math
is the more difficult for himr
He says that things are mov-
ing a little fast for him “I feel
I need some explanations that
the other students don't,” he
explains, “but I can't see hold-
ing up the rest of the class be-
cause of my own uncertainties.
Besides," he says, “dropping
the course this semester just
means starting it again next.”

Slipping behind a little doesn’t
complicate his life much. “At
42, grades don't make a whole
lot of difference," he says, It’s
obvious that he‘s satisfied with
just being able to go back to
school, an opportunity few
middleaged people get or take.

Pierce was at first apprehen-
sive about taking the job with
Grinnell College. But then he
thought of the tuition-free edu-
cation the college offers faculty
and staff children, anti, from
that moment on, the matter
was settled. He calculated that

it would cost him a little over
$84,000 to put all seven of his
children through School. While
a physics technician‘s salary
is nothing to sneeze at, he felt
that his bank account probably
would not survive the blow

He enjoys working with the
students and faculty in the
physics department and feels
there is less pressure on him
in this type of work. “As a me-
chanic, you could do a job
right and still have an unhap-
py customer," he recalls. Now-
adays, he can more or less dee
cide his own work schedule,
which has to be juggled around
classes and study hours.

One thing is for sure, how-
ever. He'll never have to face
another greasy automobile en-
gine or messy tool box in his
new line of work. Well, almost
never; he just had to excuse
himself —— to go show a fresh»
man student in introductory
physics how to use an instm~
ment called a socket wrench.

No spring, nor summer beauty hath such grace,
As i have seen in one autumnal face.

Elegies. IX. The Autumnal
John Donne

FALL PHOTOGRAPHS BY DAVID SNYDER

' FALL FREAK-OUT

By Mark Graeser

”Cheer up brothers,
Live in the sunshine,
We'll understand it all
Bye and bye.”

when I heard old country Ere
nest Tubbs on the radio yester-
day twanging out this lyric ol
'the old ile Spiritual “Farther
Along”, I scarcely realized how
prophetic it was. I should have
guessed it when I joined the
crowd ill front oi the Forum
yesterday afternoon. There they
were suddenly, a bunch of jest
plain folks drinkin’ beer, smilin’
on their brothers, and soaking
up the spectacular autumn sun»
shine.

And then old Slim and the
boys came on with their in
struments, pluckin’ out some
tunes for the folks. Soon people
commenced to dance up a
storm, do—si-doing and swingin’
the gals round and round.

The dancing got faster, and
the clapping and yelling louder,
until nearly everyone was
stretched out snake-dancing,
winding around the trees on
Central Campus faster and last-
er til the snake's back broke,
strewing people llatbacked all
over the leaf-crinkled ground.

The din dulled momentarily
when an uptight Dean Conney
Kimbo stomped up to the scene
of the crime to tell the Cole-
brants to “get rid of the beer"
because “drinking in public like
this is illegal.” The swarms re-
sponded by clapping up a last
rhythm and dancing to it. The
dean turned around, and strode
back to Burling Basement —
ignored.

Again the snake arose. slither-
ing toward the forbidden fruit,
the library. There the snake
dissolved, and. . .Genesis. . .an
egg hatched. .and there
emerged a student body breath-

ing, touching itself, and taking
its first step.

“Let's levitate the library",
someone shouted.

“Levitate! Levitate! Levi—
tate!" everyone cried, watching
to see it the building moved.
Why didn't it rise? “It’s the
evil spirits”, laughed someone
in front.

Dancing hand in hand around
the library, the motley group
chanted “evil spirits” in unison
as they exorcized the devils,
then regrouped in front of the
library. Though still impulsive
and capricious the group began
to blend culture and politics,
Chanting “Ho Ho Ho Chi Minh,
NLF is going to win.”

The group, now about 150
strong, entered the library and
began walking quietly down the
aisles to the strumming of its
minstrels. The inhabitants of
the library viewed the horde
with mixed reactions: some
openly laughed and joined in,
others burrowed their eyes deep
inside their books ignoring the
whole crazy procession.

Once outside, the folks headed
toward the Forum, chanting. ap-
propriately, "Forum! Forum!"
As the crowd wound through the
grill toward the North lounge,
tlley chanted “2, 4, 6, 8, we are
going to liberate!” 7

In the North lounge people
swarmed around the middle of
the room brushing against each
other, laughing, shouting and
dancing to music inside their
heads, Again the snake. and
coils Dl bodies bounced and
breathed the electric air.

Steppenwolt's “Born to be
Wild” lunged from the juke box
shattering the snake into n hun-
dred dancing figures Among the
crowd were several people that
I have never seen dance before.

Then the mellow Youngbloods
Came on with ”Get Together,"

and the folks just sat on the
floor and listened again to a
song they knew and felt by
heart.

It was by now 5:20 and time
to go to the Quad for early din—
ner. Chanting again “Ho Ho Ho
Chi Minh, the NLF is going to
win," they walked past the
Coats and ties waiting for the
doors to open and walked thru
the gates.

Once inside, they filed past
the slack-jawed Saga workers
and sat around a rather large
number of tables, for they still
numbered around 100.

None wore ties, a few were
barefoot, everyone was noisy,
and they hadn’t bothered to
knock before coming inside.

They must have seemed an
awesome beast, but they were
served their mystery meat along
with the rest. There weren‘t
many complaints about the food
since mostly people were too
busy singing.

They sang “Home, Home on
the Range," “Iowa" (the state
song I think), “She’ll be com-
in‘ 'round the mountain," and
a version of “Star-Spangled
Banner" that you’ve never seen
at a baseball game. The anthem
was accompanied by raised
clenched fists, signifying “Pow
er to the People."

Some chants included:
“ecstacy,” ”Alka - Seltzer,"
“apathy," “cream pull," “dare
to struggle, dare to win," and
the old favorite, “Gimme an
F . . . Gimme: an , . . gimme
a C . . . ”

Before leaving, the folks

Monmouth Shuts out Pioneers, 21-0;
Lawrence Game Ends Season Saturday

By Steve Wells

Grinnell dropped its second
game in a row last Saturday
losing to conierence co-lender
Monmouth 21-0. Grinnell's des
tense played an excellent game,
holding the tough Monmouth
offense to 219 yards. The deiense
was particularly hard on Mon
month’s allrconference fullback
Charley Corie allowing him only
56 yards in 18 carries. The Pio-
neer offense did much better,
however, limiting the Scot’s do
tense to only 149 yards and one
one touchdown.

Grinnell seemed to be the
superior team in the first quarr
ter, not allowing Monmouth to
move the ball while driving in-
side the Scot’s twenty yard line
twice. Their first time with the
ball the Pioneers drove to the
Monmouth 11 before they were
stopped. Late in the quarter
Grinnell drove 40 yards to the
Monmouth 17 where Roy Lewis
was thrown for a 13-yard loss
on a field goal attempt. Mon»

- mouth took the ball on the 30
and drove 70 yards for a score
with the touchdown coming on
a 51 yard pass and an or) halts
time lead.

The Pioneer deleiise kept
Monmouth bottled the rest oi
the half while Grinnell’s of-
iense drove deep into the
Scots’ territory twice only to
be stopped by incomplete and
intercepted passes.

Near the end oi a scoreless
third quarter Bruce Rollins
dropped back to punt for Grin-
nell. He was smothered be
fore he could get the ball Off
and Monmouth took over on the
Grinnell 162 One play later the
Scots scored on a sweep around
left end.

With nine minutes left in the
game Grinnell drove from their
20 to the Monmouth 29 where a
halfback pass by Bill Dicks was
intercepted and returned 71
yards for Monmouth's linal
score.

Grinnell Went to the air in
a last effort to catch up, but
quarterback Johnson had two
more passes intercepted to halt
the drives.

The one came in the final secs
ends of the game after the Pior
neers had gained a ﬁrst and
goal on the Monmouth eight.

Soccer Club Knocks Knox, 4-1

By Steve Wells
in what was undoubtably its
best game this year, Grinnell
soccer club picked up its second
win or the season deieating
Knox 471. The entire team
played well in the Pioneers first
victory over Knox in at least
lour years.

Grinnell used a new iorma-
tion to give the team added
strength on defense. Shifting
Bruce Graham from a iorward
to a halfback, the Pioneers
were able to contain Knox on
defense while maintaining a
potent scoring punch.

Steve Korstad got Grinnell oil
to a quick lead, heading in a
goal in the opening minutes at
play. Both teams scored mid
way through the half with Gra—
ham moving up irom his half-
back spot to score lor the
Pioneers.

Ron Lord, helped uy Tom
Lincoln's assist, scored near the
end of the half to give Grinnell
a 371 halftime lead. Lincoln took
the goalie out of position by
taking a shot oil or Lord’s pass
while actually letting the ball
pass between his legs for the
score.

Steve Hirshon scored the
Pioneers' final goal late in the
Second half to givc Grinnell the
lit victory.

we did not score against Moro
mouth, and feel that we could
have it we had been able to
come up with a more effective
ground game to complement
our passing attack,” coach Bow-
ers said. “Naturally, i was dis-
appointed that we lost,” Bowers
stated.

“This was a game we really
wanted to win. i think we will
bounce back and give Lawrence

a good game," the coach said.
“The morale is good, we are in
the best physical shape of the
year, and a victory would give
us a 673 record that we would
all be very proud of.“

The Lawrence-Grinnell game
will wrap up the season for both
first division clubs.

The Pioneers were ontshot by
Graceland 16-31,
