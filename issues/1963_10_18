Diem Suppresses Simian

it is 11V now well known that the Diem

rnmcnt in South vim-Nam is pursuing a
pilicy of ruthless political and religious slur
pi'e‘ ion The naming suicides of six Buddhist
monks leave no doubt as to the depth ot the
s‘i‘ugglc taking place in this nation. Tlierc are
many questions involved here, but one at par»
t.cular concern to the strident community
throughout the world is the open interference
of the govcrmueiit in university and student liic.

South Vietnamese universities and schools
have becomc focal points of opposition to the
Government. The countr s traditionally politi-
cally passive professors and students have joined
ranks with embattled Buddhist monk in the
deepening religious and political crisis

In August, the Government disnliargcd the
rector of the state-run University of Hue.
Father Cao Van Luan, a Roman Catholic priest.
While no reason was given {or the action, it
was widely believed that Van Lilan's disc
missiil came because students at his univer-
Sit hull participated in anti-Government
at ity. Protesting Father Cat) Van Luan‘s
removal, {ortwseveu University oi Hue faculty
members resigned on August 17. The resig-
nations included the deans of every faculty.

A similar situatton developed in Saigon on
August 22 when Dr Pham Bicti Tani was
arrested. Dl'. Tarn is dean oi the faculty oi
medicine at Saigon University and one oi South
Vict-N'dm's most respected teachers. He had
rciused to sign a Government loyalty oath.

Amid growing student unrest. the military
governor closed the university two days later
On the some day that the order was published.
e thousand students held a rally for Foreign
Secretary vii Van Mau, who had resigned on
August 22 and shaved his head Buddhistsstyle
in protest against the Government's policies.

Nearly three thousand students were arrested
on August 25 and carted oii in Army trucks,
Most were placed in a military training center
outside Saigon where those cii this for mili-
tary service and considered “militant” would
be droitcd while others who were receptive
to the “explanation oi the Government vieiv- i
point" would be released. l
The same night an unidentified student leader
smuggled identical notes to the iiciv U. s Arn-
bassador, Henry Cabot Lodge, and to key Southi
Vietnamese oftictals, saying, “\Vc now liand‘

in September the struggle was

schools and arrested 300 teenagers. 0n the ninth,
more than 100 secret policemen, supported by
armed troops, arrested about 1,000 more at al
boy's secondary school. Students at the school}
reportedly hurled desks at the police, who we}
spouded by beating some of the students andt
throwing others headlu-st inlo trucks. l

The United States

joined by

 

National Student Asso»l
ciation has expressed its full support of the‘
student protest in South Vial-Nam. When the
dismissals and arrests of late August became
known to the delegates of the National Student;
Congress this summer. the rules of the Congress
were suspended in order to consider a special,
policy declaration on the situation, i

A resolution uas passed which: condemned

expressed the iull support or United States stus,’

and urged the review of United States aid}
policies toward the Diem government The posis
lion oi the delegates was clear There is no
justification for the brutal policies of the them
government, especially in a state which is sup-l
posedly a vital bulwark against the spread of‘
tyranny.

Negroes and Grinnell

For years Grinnell has been the School of the white
liberal at which Students and faculty have discussed fare
away segregation problems with a detached air. There
have always been a few Negro Students at Gl'nnell —
enough to act as a Symbol to Grinnell's libertility.

The lezlson there tire few Negroes at Gl‘lllllell is two-
folt‘ 1) Few 'egroes are well enough prepared to attend
G ilinell, and 2) few Negroes are actually interested in
attending Grilinell.

Demonstrating Gl'inliell’s active interest in the civil
rights problem, President Howard R. Bowen yester tiy outs
lined two proposals to a group of students. The success of
one proposal does not depend upon the other.

The first proposal is for Griniiell to become affili-
ated with tt Southern Neg ~i college and to become closely
connected with the operation of that college. This pros
pitsal is already in the negotiating: stage, and the follow-
ing possibilities are offered by such it fraternal agree-
ment:

—A program to excllalig'e‘students for a se-
master.

7A program to exchange faculty members for
a year.

—Exclizinge of faculty lecturers.

—Annilal joint faculty conference.

—Annlial Joint student conference.

iCLlltlll'zll exchanges of student plays, recit-
als etc.

—Leci.ure series conducted by professors of
one school over telephone lines.

—lntercollegiate athletic Competition between
the schools \‘itll each trip being a three or
four day of lir. ,

iFlltli year students going into the South to
teach in much the Same fashion Gi'innell’s
Fifth Year Abroad system works.

This proposal stemmed from a recent study President
Bowen made for the United Church of Christ, 2m organiza-
tion to which Griiinell belongs. As chairman of a summit
tee studying what could be done to help with the educa-
tion problem in the South, the President worked with the
President of ti Southern Neg‘ro college who was anxious to
initiate Such an agreement with Gl'innell. _

The advantages of such an agreement to the Southern
College would be great, its Grinnell's valuable facilities
would become available to this School. All advantage for
both schools would be that this program would give Whites
and Negroes the opportunity of forming friendships, of
learning of the cultural differences, and of gaining ti
genuine Social education.

President Bowen's second proposal is that Grimiell
join with three or four other liberal arts colleges of zip-
prinxinlately equal standing and through a jointly operat-
ed admission. i'et liiliuent office bring Negroes and other
minorities to [it e college . The object of the program
it ltl be to bring membels of minority groups, some of
whom are not up to the Standards for regular admission
to the college, into the liberal arts college.

The program could be implemented in the following
l1 miller: l) Talie selected students and give them a Spe-
‘cial summer Session to try to bring their education level
lap to that of the incoming freshmen who have come from
the better high schools; 2) Give these selected freshmen
special counselling and perhaps have them take a light
icolil'se load until they can adjust to the Grinnell Standard.
i In this way Gl’innell would admit perhaps :30 students,
‘mziiiy of whom could not 0 'iginally meet Grinnell‘s entrance
{requirements Through this extra guidance and counselling
(and perhaps through-2m extid year of college), however,
,tliese intelligent but culturally deprived students could re~
receive an education. Neither for the college nor for the
lspeciztlly admitted students would this be easy, but it would
'b a definite and perceptible step in the lindel'priviledg‘ed’s
‘1 gilt for equality.

, Two other colleges have tilieddy joined Grimiell in lay»
‘lllg‘ the foundation for the Second ploposal.

'l‘lit: thinking" behind both these programs is that
Grinnell ‘llollld do its purl to help the Negro and all oth«
er minority groups gilt for equality. The only weapon
Grililiell has to offer is an ediiczttioli. President Bowen
has discovered. uiioreo or, that Grinuell can not sit and
wait for the few qimli led students come to us—that we
must {:0 out and help train students who can take ad-
vantage of the academic excellence Gt niiell has to offer,
that we must go olil‘ and associate with Neg 0 colleges
and close the educational ,gap which lies before the
N‘Qg'l'lll who is lryin to gain his rights as a citizen.

We pledge our wllule~liearted support to this two—
prong’ed program which would make Grinnell a vital in—
strument in overcoming: racial barriers which have long
been the,Uliited Stales' domestic eye-sore. For months we,
have pleaded for a chance to play a part in drama which
has unfolded in the U. S. over the past few yeti Now
an opportunity has come.

”: Quartet Plays Brahms, Beethoven, Goren

By Karen Adkinson

A quartet is a handy thing.
It can play not only chamber

“Going through Nebraska on

The Lenox String Quartet has

"When we came last year." i
explained Dnniilli McCall, cel—
iist, "we didn’t expect to be
here just one year. A position
of artistina-esidencc usually
implies a tcniire oi some
length. Besides. we came back ,
because we like it here."

This summer the Lenox quar
tet spent nine weeks in rcsi
dcncc at the Aspen Music Fes ‘
tival and School of Music. As
well as performing, the quartet _
coached a dozen sti ig quartets.
Prior to their Aspen engagement
they gave several summer con.
certs in San Francisco sponsor-
ed by Mills College and the San
Francisco Museum of Art.

Over the summer the quartet

Laser Poses Vasi

By John Wolf _

The gas laser and ils possible‘
uses in the fields of medicine
and communications were the
subjects ot a lecture and deinuns‘
stration given by Dr. Herbert
Trotter, Ji~., last Friday evening

Possibilities
Communications

in Roberts Theatre. i .

Trotter is chairman oi Lhci
board of General Telephone and
Electronic: Laboratories, Inc.

In the demonstration, Trotter
used a heliumencon laser in|
which the electrons of the hel'
um atoms are excited by a light'
beam. when these electrons re-
turn to a lower energy level
they giro up quanta of energy,
whioii in turn stimulate the‘
electrons or the neon atoms to
higher energy levels When
these electrons fall back, they>
give off quanta or light which'
are in phase and therciore at
higher intensity than the source

The parallel laser rays are
capable ot producing beams oi
highly concentrated l i g h t
which can be used in medical
work. The laser is presently
used in retinal surgery and i
for the treatment oi certain
skin ailments.

To illustrate the use of the
laser in communications, Trot»:
ter broadcast a tape recording:
on a laser beam to a receiver-
and ainpiiiier. When the laser
beam was blocked. the anipir
fier received no signals and the
sound stopped.

Trotter explained that to have
intelligence superimposed on a
beam, the light must be order-
ed; the laser produces a con
lherent, ordered beam. Furthe..t
since the amount of information‘
a beam can carry varies r'ircet-
iy with the lrequcncy o: the,
radiation, the laser beam hasl

their scoring thrusts, Gl'mncll
relied on a strong running
game, led by junior Elston

netted 136 yards on 28 carries
and Shieiholz, who gained 55
yards on ll attempts, accounted

Lawrence received the open-
ing kickott and drove immedir
atcly for their first touchdown.
