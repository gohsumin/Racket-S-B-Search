Five seniors were announced
as new members of the col-

during an annual program held
Wednesday night in Herrick

No Fast Planned
For November 19

Speaker of the Senate Jim
Parkison told the 88:13 this
Week that Grinnell will not par-
ticipate in the national Thanks-
giving Fast For Food program,
under the direction of Negro
leader Martin Luther King, 11‘.

when camp'us members in-
qull'ed into the possible partic-
ipatlon of Griniiell students in
this program, they were told
that the college food service,
SAGA, had already purchased
food and had menus planned
for the rest of the month, The
program, in which a number
of colleges thi;oughout the
country are forfeiting one meal
and sending the money for that
meal to Dr, King and his com»
mittee for use in the Civil
Rights Movement, is scheduled
to take place On November 19.

Although technical circum-
stances have ruled Grinnell out
as participants in the official
program, Parkison said that
the Student Senate would dis-
cuss at its meeting next
Wednesday the possibility of
having a program here on the
local level in December. At
that time liho Senate will also
discuss plans for spending the
money, should such a program
be carried out.

 

orary society from this year’s
senior class which numbers 246.

The new members are:

William S, Abernathy, mo-
joring in philosophy and re-
ligion

Carol Benton, majoring in
music

Leslie J. Brusletten, major-
ing in psychology

Marta J. Nevampaa, major-
ing in history

Martha L. Preston, major-
ing in biology.

The students were presented
with certificates by local chap-
ter secretary James D. Kissane
(English) during the program
which was presided over by
Kenneth A. Christianseli (biol-
logy), local chapter president.

Miss Evelyn Gardner, pro-
fessor of English and‘ former
Dean of Women, spoke to die
members and guests on “Tonto
Kroger‘s Holiday.” Basing hei-
remarks on a ”long, short
story” by German author
Thomas Mann, Miss Gardner
traced the life of Tonio Krog-
er who worked with such heroic
self~discipline to achieve ex-
cellence as a poet that he
reached a state of weariness
and fatigue and proclaimed to
a confidant, ”I am Sick of
knowledge.”

”Pursuit of knowledge is a
crusade today," she said. “It is
a form of public service in
which we are all enlisted,
There is no time for dream-
ing, planning, or for personal
growih."

She went on to relate that
Tonic took his holiday, but
came back to work feeling that
he knew himself batter and that
there was something for him to
do worth doing.

 

'lots' to Happen After December 4,
When first Party Opens New For
For Music, Pool, E presso, ‘fxtras'

By Aline Furl-er
Trumpets blare. Drums roll. Curious crowds gather. The

Forum opens December 4.

And then what? Then, according to Forum Committee

Chairman Steve Buckles, “lots."

The North Lounge of the Forum will boast the typical
unionish characteristics: juke box, informal parties, rock ’n
roll groups. The South Lounge will be less typical and more
cultural and will feature programmed music, informal con-
certs, and receptions for visiting VlP’s.,,genei'al facilities will
include pool tables in the game rooms (the green onythe carpet
matches the felt of the pool tables), ping-pong tables in North
Lounge during the day, and listening rooms.

Besides catering to various social and musical tastes, the
Forum will also provide aid and sustenance to students with
busy tapeworms. The grill will handle the hamburger-ice-
ci‘eam-cone business, and the coffee house will stave off the
more ethnic hunger pangs by means of an espresso-making

machine.

As far as social organization's goes, the Forum will retain
the present committee which plans such events as informal
parties, but is also organizing another one! The latter will be
composed of students nominated by the faculty from the art,
music, and drama departments and will handle the fine arts
aspects of the Forum, For example, it will be responsible for
the programmed music in South Lounge, ‘

As a preview of what is to come and what it will be like,
there will be a“coming out" party for the Forum the night
of Friday, December 4. An informal open house affair will
precede the party which will feature variously the Rivieras,
a rock ’n roll band, aiid Maxine Seller, a folksinger from the

Mother Blues in Chicago.

So when December 4 rolls around—come one, come all

each night at 8:15.

Walter Lowe is cast in the
title role. Lowe is a freshman,
and heads a cast that is pres
dominately freshman.

Margaret Weathers, sopho-
more English major, plays the
role of Jocasta, wife of Oedi-
pus, and queen of Thebes

Tiresias, the blind prophet,
is played by Terry McCoy, jun-
ior English major, and Daniel
Mason, freshman, plays Creon,
brother of J'ocasta,

Other principals include Rlc

MacDowell, freshman, as a
priest of Zeus; Burt McDowell,
sophomore, as a messenger
from Corinth; Maxwell Helfa
gott, freshman, as a shepherd,
and Charles Burns, freshman.
as a palace official.

The chorus of Theban elders

The Greek tragedy which is

Combine Classical, Functional Elements
Set Stresses Live Aspects of ’Odeipus’

“The technical aspects of the
set accord with our attempt to
treat Oedipus Rex, not as a
historical piece, but as living
theater,” states Richard Mey-
ers, technical director of the
Theater. The play will be we
sented this Thursday, Friday
and Saturday in Robert's Theat-
er.

The set, combining classical
and funclional elements, is
composed of large corrugated
cardboard pillars and a raised
platform, “The decor,” states
Meyers, “suggESstthe period,
and the size and shapes sug-
gest the enormous traffic qual-
ity of the play.”

“The elements of the classl-
cal," continued the technical

director, “are the raised and
separate acting area for the
principle characters and the
separation of the chorus in a
manner similar to the Greek
orchestra." . ,

“The chorus is stylized in
movement and action and
straightforward in accordance
with the Greek concept." _

“Because of the many short
scenes between the principal
characters, the arrangement of
platforms, entrances and exits
is functionally designed to fa-
cilitate the actions of the ac-
tors.”

”We have tried to limit our
utilization of the classical,”
concluded Meyers, ”50 the real
elements of the play won't be
shackled by classical style."

Oracle at Delphi as a young
man that he was destined to
murder his father and marry
his mother, Shocked, he tries
to avoid his fate. His wander-
ings eventually take him to
Thebes, but on the way he has
a fight with an old man on the
road and kills him.

In Thebes he answers a rid-l
dle and thus dispells a plague
caused by a female monster,
the Sphinx, and in gratitude
the citizens of Thebes make
him king. l-le marries Jocasta,
their widowed queen.

After some years of PX‘OSF
perity another plague strikes
the city, and the cause of it is
found to be that the murderer
of the former king has not been
found. Oedipus dedicates him<
self to the search,

He discovers that the oracle
of his fate has actually been
fulfilled, and that the man he
killed at the crossroads was
the former king, his father, and
thus he had married his moth-
er. The tragedy ends in Jocas-
ta's suicide and Oedipils's blind-
ing and banishing himself.
“The play is directed by Rich-
ard D. Meyer (speech and.
theatre) and Mrs. Betty G.
Voertman (speech and theatre).
Stage manager and assistant to
the director is John Howard,
senior.

Costumes were designed by
Mrs. Voertman and the cos-
tumes crew head is Karen Har<
dy, senior. Jutly Pcal'son, sen-
iOr is in Charge of lights, and

Shame of Empty Seals

‘ The local chapter of Phi Beta Kappa and its distin-
guished speaker were the victims this week of the\ new plan to
hold special chapel services on Wednesday night rather than
the usual Friday morning slot. The chapter could have chosen
no more eloquent member of the college community to address
their group and guests than Evelyn Gardner, yet participants
and visitors alike could not help but note that on a campus
boasting academic excellence, only a handful of students and
faculty members could manage to attend an event attesting to
that excellence.

Those who plan the schedules of chapel events had no
choice but to place such events in the evenings after the admin-
lstration added an extra class hour on Friday mornings But

those who plan and those who influence those plans should
take immediate heed to the warning and do something before

more organizations are embarras‘sEd and more speakers spend
their labors on just a handful.

Students, meanwhile, will try to garner sympathy for their
tough schedules and the lack of time to fulfill those schedules,
land we can certainly see that tO take an hour out late in the
morning is lnuch easier to do than to take a piece out of an
evening. Yet, wllile they face the situation of having the lec-
tures at night, we can only say that to refuse to attend because
they think they don’t have time is Only using poor judgment.
In almost every instance they miss out on something worth-
while. Certainly this was the case Wednesday night.

Are Dance lM's Dying?

the ladies instituted their integrated dorm system which placed '

freshmen in every dorm. In fact, things were going just too
smoothly, for the gals woke up this week to find themselves
suffering from a severe case of apathy. The old fire that used
to exist among the freshmen when their numbers were concen»
trated together, and which subsequently would trickle down
the loggia to wash upon some tired and worn upperclass
women was never ignited this year. Thus, the night Of nights,
when the quad puts its pointed foot forward in grandest style,
threatens to see the‘ ladies fall flat on their powdered noses.

' Dance IM’s are coming. Certainly the highlight of the Quad-
rangle activities for the fall semester, Dance IM’s have always
stood as the single time each year when the members of the
Quad get together to put on a worthwhile show and have lots
of fun doing it. Now, few care.

Perhaps the worst part Of the situation concerns those
freshmen ill Main and Loose, whose halls have already dropped
out of competition for lack of interest. They have been short-
changed by their hall presidents and haffleboards. The coin-
plaint from hall officers has been —— well, the freshmen didn’t
sign up. Our complaint is — you didn’t tell them. A piece of
paper on the hall bulletin board has very little claim to fresh-
men interest, but an enthusiastic upperclassman who can tell
them just what the program is all about and how much fun it is
can fill many a signup sheet. Let’s hope that the women of the
Quad don’t follow the examples set by Main and Loose and
allow themselves to be paralyzed by apathy. Integrating the
lorms has spread the Quad’s life blood much thinner. Right
low she lies a little anemic — maybe what she needs is a shot

freshman Wonders
About ARH Steps

To the Editor:

As a freshman I have been
pleased with life and seTViCe
at Grinnell. However I do have
an observation to make.

Several weeks ago I nearly
met death in ARH. As I calmly
journeyed from class to class
I slipped down the stairs in
ARH. Had it been only one
flight I might have overlooked
the hazard, but it wasn't and
I’ve been hobblmg ever since.
Seeking sympathy I mentioned
my accident to the girls in the
dorm. Instead of sympathy I
found only the knowing looks
of those who had fallen before
me.

We fallen women would like
to suggest that some safety
precautions be made to guard
against serious accidents in
ARI-I. Because the metal step
guards are worn, they are ex-
tremely dangerous. From all
reports the danger will only be
increased with the Iowa snOWS
and wet boots.

For the sake of all, I urge -

B&G to either level all two
story buildings or make the

ARH stairs more sale.

Upon reading of the absurdities
in regard to the painting and re-

“gag” letter. But recent word from
Imy son informs me this is no joke,
lbut regrettable truth. i wish to add
,my protests to those of the writer
in the October so issue, Scarlet and

From what I am told there is a
great deal of dissatisfaction among
students in regard to the organizar
tiun in v 01V e d (Buildings and

been other incidents of a similar
nature. Regardless of policy in
such matters, it seems to me the
action taken was childish and Vin»

Study, Don’t Paint,
Says Another Alum

To the Editor!

In regard to theletter from
Jacob B. Browning, an alumnus
from whom I have heard very
little, until now, I disagree.
Every Joe College who comes
along thinks he can change
anything to Suit his own mlel"
ests completely disregarding
institutional regulations that
are established for his own pro
tection, Grinnell is small, sure,
small enough to make blatant
disregard all too obvious. The
school has funds and men to
keep the buildings in tip-top
shape. Let’s hope that that
young man who painted his
room was an art major, other-
Wise he will have gained noth—
ing but an awareness of the
pitfalls of neglecting his stud-
ies for a pointless pastime. The
pages in his books should keep
him busy enough to forget me
walls around him.

Can Poem Be Serious And light?
Kuntz Calls For Readers Verdict

To the Editor:

The poet E. L. Mayo of Drake
University spoke in the Fine Arts
Series on November 5 Among the
questions that bothered students.
one was put to him at lunch: “All
your‘ poems are very serious. Do
you ever write light versez” He
answered “no," and now I'm
puzzled by “The Mole," which ap-
pears in The Diver, published by
the yniversity of Minnesota press,
and copyrighted in 1947:

“The Mole”

When the mole goes digging
He never meets a soul;
The stars are inattentive
To the motions of the mole.

Peace Corps Exam
Offered in Burling

A Peace Corps placement ex«

signments, will be given next Sat<
urday, Nov. 21, at 8:30 am. in
Buriing Library.

Persons interested in taking the
exam must first contact Dale B.

torne Sequeira, director 01 place-
ment and student aid.

 

He digs his frantic tunnel

Through chalk and clay and
slime

i-iis never-ending tunnel

A mouthful at a time.

Alone; no planet bothers
To tell him where to dig.
For males are very little
And worlds are very big.

And when his tunnel ceases
The little mole lies stark.
And at his back Is dimness,
And at his head, the dark.

So to the mole all honor

And the labors of the mole,

With doubtfulness for tunnel

And ignorance for goal.

My puzzle is this; first I thought
it very amusing. But now my col-
leagues say it's a serious poem,
about philosophers, or about phil-
osophers of certain kinds

Perhaps you readers can decide.
Can a poem be both serious and
light, amusing and very sad?

Grail Describes Mississippi Experience — Wow About Us. '

(EDITOR‘S NOTE: The
following is taken from a let-
ter written by Vicki Mittle-
lellldt, ’63, who is now a stu-
dent at the Yale School of Di-
yinity. The letter was written
on Oct. 8.),

Last week the National Coun-
cil of Churches issued an emer~
gency call for ministers to

ome down to McComb, Mis-
lissippi. l was one of the three
from here who went to McComb
for a week. Bear with me for
awhile for I would like to take
the time to relate some of my
experiences.

First a little background on

' McComb. . . . McComb was
the first city to have any “north-
ern agitators" enter and try to
attempt to organize the Negro
community. This initial action
was done under the auspices of
SNCC in 1361. Because of lack
of interest on the part of the
northerners and a lack of mon-
ey the project was discontinued
As soon as the northerners
moved out of the community,
the White citizens of McComb
took the opportunity to put the
Negroes “back in their places."
,There followed a prolongEd pe-
riod of bombings, beatings, po-
lice harassment, and the like.
It was not until a year ago that
SNCC moved back into the
oommunity to stay no matter
what The program expanded
this summer under the direc-
tion of COFO (Conference
of Federated Organizations),
which sponsored a strong Mis-
sissippi Summer Project. Then
came the fall when many of the
students working there had to
leave to return to school. Again
the retaliation of the white citi~
zens was felt. As you may have
read in the press reports
,(what ones there were), there
have been sixteen bombings,
eight burnings of homes and
churches, plus continual arr
rests, beatings, and police ha-
rassment since th e begin-
ning of July, with the majority
of these occurring in Septem-
ber. The total Negro commun»
ity was, needless to say, demor-
aliZEd. The National Council of
Churches wanted white and Ne-
gro ministers from the North
to go into McComb to offer
some balance of power. Hope-
fully some of the retaliation
could be stemmed by having
persons in the area who could,
at any time, call out of the
state and to their local news-
papers issuing stories on the
condih'ons in McComb.

Moving on from an ”objec-
tive” account of what was

happening, I would like to
enumerate some of my person-
nl impressions about the trip.

Dave, Jim and I flew from
New York to Jackson. The air-
port in Jackson is outside the
city, so we climbed into the
back of a limousine for the trip
into the city. No one said a
word to us the whole trip, ex-
cept one southern gentleman
who asked me if it would be all
light if he smoked a pipe. (My
first and last contact with the
white, deitistic approach to the
white woman.) All during the
trip the three of us, were con-
otantly watched in the side
mirrors. What amazed me was
how we were immediately tak-

 

en for “outsiders." I later asked
a student here from Mississippi
why this was. His answer was
that the way we dress, our
mannerisms, and, especially,
the cut of my hair gave us
away immediately.

When we arrived in J aekson,
the other gentlemen in the lim<
ousine had their bags _carried
by Negro porters in one direc-
tion. The three of us picked up
our bags and walked in the op-
posite direction into the Negro
community. I did not realize it
at the time, but with that ac-
tion of entering the Negro com—
munity I was thereby barred
from any further possible con-
tact with the white community
for as long as I was to be in
Mississippi. In a sense, we had
changed identities and were
now, for all practical purposes,
black (This was less true for me
because I am a white woman.
The hierarchy of life in the
South seems to be a very funda-
mentalist God, the white wo<
man, the white man, the Negro,
and the ”Nigger lover.” Given
this hierarchy there w ere
months when 1 was an asset to
the group I was with, and there
were other moments when I
was decidedly and frightenly
(sic) a death warrant.)

Once Within the Negro com-
munity we went to the office of
the National Council of Church-
es (NCC). There we were
briefed somewhat on how to
act in event of violence or po-
tential violence, Oddly enough
this session helped to calm me
somewhat. For the night before,
before going “calmly” off to
sleep, 1 had'spent some time
trying to think out how I would
act in the different situations.
In one instance I had decided
that the best manner to con-
front a hostile mob would be
to attempt to establish some
rapport with the person who ap-
peared to be the leaderl This
could be done by asking if he
knew my name or where I was
from. This was precisely the
strategy described to us. It’s
odd. . . . once in a new‘irame-
work of thinking the fears that
bothered one at the beginning
are the accepted facts of living.
The problem then is not what
the situation is, but how to best
cope with it.

 

From Jackson we went to a
small town about twenty miles
away. The car We traveled in
was a Hertz rent-away car,
They are fast, and air condi-
tioned. The air conditioning
helps because all traveling is
done with the windows closed,
the doors locked and the seat
belts securely fastened. Hertz
now when renting to the NCC
immediately disconnects the

dome light with all the doors. ’

This is so that one will never
be silhouetted in the dark and
thereby be an easy target This
was a precautionary method
learned by the death of Med-
gar Evars. ‘

In Edwards we changed cars
It was dusk; we had over eighty
miles to travel; We did not know
the way for sure; the man who
was guiding us had been picked
up by the police on the road to
McComb just that afternoon;
and now the car was integrated.
Since white women civil rights
workers had only been allowed
into the McComb area two
days earlier, one of our. con-
cerns was would my presence
be an assetor not? As we trav-
eled we were followed by p0<
lice in various small towns
along the way, but were never
stopped for “supposed” traffic
violations. This was an encour-
aging sign.

We arrived in McComb and
went immediately to the COFO
groundsr COFO has two houses
to house the workers and one
building used as an office. Now
there is a permanent staff of
eight workers from all over
the nation — Oregon to New
Yorkia‘lso there is a girl from
Germany, one fellow from Can-
ada, and another from England.
I was very impressed with the
calm, pervading atmosphere
Each person was there by
choice and that is all that is
asked. There is a job to be done
and it is carried out in a calm
and effective manner.

Every night persons take
turns standing guard. The pur-
pose of the guard is to warn
mose who are sleeping of im-
pending danger. Earlier this
summer the Freedom House
where the workers slept had
been bombed—no one was in—
jured, but this was due in part
to the warning system, The

guard also serves to take down
the license plate numbersof the
cars (which are not police
cars) that constantly circle the
Freedom House grounds every
night. Theefirst night I slept
in Freedom House. The only
disturbance that night was two
investigations, one by the FBI
and another, just a casual in-
spection by the local police.

The next day Dave, Jim and
I spent canvassing the Negro
neighborhoods for potential
voters and young kids to at-
tend the Freedom Schools. Al~
though this was our assigned
task, I think we accomplished
the most just by being friendly
white people in the area. All
day we were followed by the
police and, at times, by white
men in unidentified cars.

stealing electricity (he was fix-
ing a COFO car in the front
yard underneath a tree). The
trial was set for 2 pm. the next
clay. and was held at 10 am.
without his lawyer present, and
he was convicted. He was sen~
tenced to jail plus receiving a
$1,500 fine. When Mrs. Dillon
tried to pay the fine, it was
raised to $2,000. In addition,
Mrsl Dillon had been‘iurther
threatened by the police offi-
cers. (The Di‘llons have two
small children) Her life had
been further threatened for go-
ing to Washington

That night I was taken to her
home in the dark As soon as
I entered the home all the
blinds and the curtains were
pinned tightly shut. This was to
serve a dual purpose: (1)50
no one could see a white per-
son in the house, and (2) so
no one could see accurately to
shoot. That was the situation.
Within that framework of refer-
ence the atmosphere was rath~
er jovial because of me moth-
er’s return and the fact that the
children were safe. What cour-
age these people have!!i! Dur-
ing the night Mrs. Dillon and
I shared the guard duty. Just
as she and I sat with pistols
on our laps, so also were people
in houses across the street and
on either side of us. We all
were waiting for one of the con-
stantly cruising police cars. or
cars with unidentified white
men in them to stop, light a
fuse, and throw a bomb. As I

night. I can only ask how can
people live day after day in
such a situation? And why do
we allow, so passively, this to
continue???? Who are We
(Americans) anyway? Why do
we allow this to continue? What
is so vital to us that we remain
so unabashed to such events?

members of the Ku Klux Klan,
even the Grand Wizard him—
self, circled around and around
the Freedom House from 1 a.ml
until 5 am. The problem was,
they had heard more white wo-
men were coming in to work
ilhat night.

Now that I am becoming
emotionlly involved in what I
am writing, let me attempt to
attain more distance on the
subject and describe some of
the other things we did

Note: The Negro community
as yet does not shoot to kill,
but how long we whites expect
the violence to be only on our
side is a question we ought to
ask ourselves.

The next days were spent in
advem'sing a mass rally that
COFO was holding to try to
build the morale of the com-
munity. The closer the day of
the rally approached the more
police cars that followed us. On
the afternoon of the rally two

 

policemen spent much of their
time following me from door to
door, I took to waving (refrain-
ing from saying, “Freedom,
now”), but they did not seem
to notice. . . . .

All I can keep reiterating is
the tremendous courage these
people have. They are willing
in risk meir lives for some
semblance of freedom. As one
of the other women who went
to Washington said at the rally
— “it’s not hard to be brave,
but it sure is hard -m be
scared." How about us???”

“Hypocrisy has been an oft-heard cry on the
Grinnell campus concerning a wide variety of subjects.
I would like, however, to explore the “hypocrisy is-
sue" in still another area — that of the Grinnell ath-
letic world. This issue, of course, could be philosophical-
1y discussed as to the place of athletics at a liberal
arts institution such as Grinnell. However, I just wish
to examine the hypothesis that Grinnell purports a
level of athletic competition which, in fact, does not
exist. Whether the level of competition which in ac-
tuality does exist is good or evil is not my concern
here, I am merely asserting its existence.

Let me begin by quoting first the Grinnell College
Bulletin “Athletic competition is not allowed to inter—
fere with the student’s primary purpose at Grinnell,
that of obtaining a good liberal arts education,” and
secondly Football Coach Edd Bowers in the Bill Bry-
son column of the Des Moines Tribune (May 7, 1962),
“Not a one of them (Grinnell athletes) was recruited,
and not a one is here on an athletic scholarship. Every
scholarship is strictly academic" It is this image of
“keeping athletics in their proper place" that I believe
Grinnell attempts to project to the public.

In reality, however, we are a school which staffs an
admissions man who, among other things, is assigned
to recruiting (I use the term loosely) athletes The
coaches and interested officials can often be seen eat-
ing lunch with prospective GrinnelI athletes, and
courting them about campus in a way which could
be reserved for those with 800 College Board'Scores.

The effectiveness of our “recruiting" program is
exhibited by the fact that although only some 50% of
the student body claim Iowa or Illinois as their home
state, 25 of 32 or 78% of the football players must do
so. Of the remaining seven, three hail from Minnesota
and one lived in Iowa when he started here as a fresh—
man, Meanwhile Carleton supposedly our chief aca-
demic rival in the Midwest Conference claims only 19
of 45 from Minnesota, 8 from Illinois, 5 from Wiscon-
sin, and in all 13 states and Canada are represented on
their roster. As a result of this program, although I
have no specific information, I question whether
scholarship or admission is granted on “strictly" aca-
demic grounds.

In addition, there exists an opportunity for the
newly arrived non-intellectual “jock" to exist and in-
deed often to thrive on Grinnell society. The “jock”

Another heavy barrage of

goals by Vince Anku led Grim

fall of 1961.

Holder of all Pioneer score
ing records, Anku, this season
upped his single game stand—
ard to six goals and increased
his career mark to 68.

Anku twice notched six goals
in a match this fall—against
Northern Illinois in the opener
and later against Carleton Be-
fore getting 51X, he wrote the
old school mark of flve.’

In all, Anku kiCked in 21 of
Grinnell's 35 goals this year.
The! other Pioneer markers
were claimed by Fred Miller
and Frank Chilinmllo, four
apiece; Ted Cole, three; Felix
Lungu, two: and John Emery,
one.

A star from his first appear-
ance/in a Pioneer uniform—
he tallied four times that after-
noon—Anku collected his 68
goals in 23 matches—an aver-
age of almost three per outing.
Only once was he shut out, in a
1-0 victory over Lake Forest in
1962.

Anku chalked up a new
school one-season mark of 21
goals in 1952 and raised it to
26 a year ago

In addition to sharing the
number two spot in the scar

; Senate Studies Bill To ‘Promote Awareness' 0% Grinnell

By Wayne Stengel

Wednesday evening, November
ith, the Grinnell Student Senate
,voted to postpone further consider-
ations of a bill by Senator Dennis
Murphy of East to “formulate pos-
ltive suggestions for making in-
formation about Grinnell College
available to a greater number of
high school students," until a reg-
ularly scheduled Senate meeting
on November 18th,

Senator Murphy's bill was kept

intact despite an effort by Senator
Dan Bucks of Gates to delete the
second of its two proposals which
would establish a committee to
suggest means of “improving and
broadening" the admissions re-
quirements at Grinnell College.
Buck’s motion, overwhelmingly re-
jected _by voice vote, preceded his
expressed opposition to the entire
bill for fear that its adoption would
bring strong criticism on the Sen-
ate for moving into this area at ad-
ministrative affairs. Senator Nol'd
Brue of Cowles reflecting similar
dissensiul’t said that word of mouth
would always be the strongest fac»

tor in interesting students from,

geographically distant points in
Grinnell, and that, despite its
limitations, the Admissions Office
tines an excellent job in selecting
students.

Senator Murphy was quick to age

ert that his bill should in no \vay

Admissions Office, but rather as a
progressive move to make well<
ﬂualified students from all areas
or the United States, particularly

erlin, and other schools of‘Grin-
nell’s size and comparable aca-
demic stature.

Using statistics gathered from
the freshman classes entering
Grinnell in 1960 and 1963, Murphy
sighted that only 860 completed an
plicetions reached the admissions
office in 1963, causing admission's
officers to reject one half or less

of all those applying, an occur-
rence somewhat inexplicable at a
small distinguished liberal arts col-
lege. t

The College Board Scot-e median
for the class entering in 1960 was
sufficiently lower than that of any
of the schools which Grinnell nor
mally likes to consider its intellec-
tual rivals. Though the College

Board Score median has risen as
of 1964, Murphy feels that Grinnell
consistently lags behind its aca-
demic competitors because of this
recurrent inability to make itself
known in all parts of the country.

The first tangible aspect of his
bill would be the formation of a
student committee to find out how
the members or the student body

and alumni became interested in
the college and why they made
their final decision to attend Grin-
nell. Senator Murphy declined to
comment on more specific imple-
mentation of his resolution until
after a conference with Admis<
sions Director Robert Sauersend
the final verdict on his proposal on
November 18.
