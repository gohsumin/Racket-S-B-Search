Speak Out begins Vietnam protest

By Mary Malcolm

“It is necessary to protest because
many Americans would have us all re-
main silent. I defend protest as a pa-
triotic act and a democratic gesture."
cried Alan R. Jones (history) in Thurs-
day afternoon's Speak Out against the
war in Vietnam. The Speak Out culmi-
nated a week of active Iacultystudent
discussion meetings and preceded t0<
morrow’s demonstration in Des Moines

Over 100 members or the college com-
munity will join in the Des Moinea

Anti-anti
Demonstrators

Demonstrate

By Paul Nachman

Several students in disagreement with
the mobilization against the Vietnam
war staged a counter-demonstration at
the Thursday afternoon onrcampus Speak
Out. They plan to repeat their counter
demonstration Saturday.

Voicing objections to Saturday's Spring
Mobilization to End the War in Vietnam,
senior Greg Robinson at a Tuesday eve-
ning meeting in Clark lounge outlined
plans {or a “mobilization against th
mobilization."

Robinson explained to about 30
students. including several “iniiltrators”
from the main mobilization. that the
counter~mobilizers will hold a demon
stration when the Spring Mobilizers
leave ior Des Moines Saturday. Several
ccunterdemonstrators will also go to
Des Moines, he said.

Stressing that the counter mobilizers
are not necessarily pro-war, Robinson
explained that they decry the demonstrae
tors’ oversimplitication oi the issues
“Demonstrations thrive on blackrand—
white issues —- on emotionallsm." he
said. “but the issues aren’t that simple.”

the Veteran’s Auditorium to the State
Capitol Building in Des Moines, where a
rally will be held.

The two-hour Speak Out drew a crowd
which filled the ARK auditorium and
included a small core of counter-demom
strators. One picketer carried a sign
claiming that protest would prolong the
war. Joseph F. Wall (history) responded,
“You might get an “A” in Marshall
McLuhan's philosophy of ‘the message
is the message, but you will get an “F"
in history,” citing World Wars I and II
as evidence that wars end more quickly
when alternatives to unconditional sur<
render are suggested. Wall sees the role
or the dissenter as one oi oitering alter-
natives.

Ezra Mendelsohn (history) pointed to
a psychological reaction to overexposure
to the war and its horrors as one of the
factors in campus apathy, “One's im-

ISII factionalism a warning to Grinnell

The situation at Iowa State ex-
emplifies the worst possible one in
which a student government can
find itself. Campus politics are pol-
arized around the person of Donald
Smith and the Iowa State Daily.
Various factions strive for power
in the wake of an unfortunate in-
cident. The senate seems intent on
proving its power to control the
chief executive elected by the
campus as a whole. In a day and
age when there are so many issues
of importance on which students
could unite for constructive action,
the Government of the Student
Body at ISU seems intent on wast-
ing precious energy in petty bick-
ering, semantic exercises and blat-
ant maneuvering for positions of

political power or mere prestige.
Similar dangers exist at Grinnell.
All too often of late there has
been talk of factionalism in Grin-
rlell’s recently elected student gov-
ernment. It is no secret that the
Executive Cabinet and the Council
of House Presidents display a wide
range of political views. It has be»
come fashionable to characterize
student government leaders as
“liberal" or “conservative,” labels
which achieve significance only
during electoral campaigns, lf at
all. Elections are over. Our student
government represents all the stu-
dents. Let us get down to serious
business of responsible reform
which is at hand. C A

Openness characterizes sex series

News Analysis
By Susan narqulst

This week‘s sex education program
was a revealing exploration or the at-
mosphere and attitudes on campus.
Large attendance at lectures and active
participation in question periods showed
that students are interested in the Sub-
ject and are neither ashamed nor un-
easy in showing this interest.

The objective viewpoint and profes«
lional ability of the speakers were
most clearly seen in the question and
answer sessions. Both speakers fielded
more than an hour's worth of questions
marked by their openness. Students
seemed to have questions more concerns
ing physiology than sociology.

The lectures attempted to cover as-
pects or the physiology and sociology or
sex assuming little knowledge on the
part of the audience. As a result, the
presentations were quite simple. The
discussions. on the other hand, were
detailed and varied; from anatomy to
physiological iunctioning oi birth con-
trol pills, the ethical and political ques-
tions of abortion and the role of guilt
in sexuality.

More than two hundred students
signed up to discuss the subject and
the idea of a continued sex education
program.

The faculty panel today at 4 pm.
promises to increase the session’s value

by relating the topic more directly to
Grinneil.

Fast on April 21 will
aid Sudanese refugees

Last semester about sun students par-
ticipated in a fast to raise money to
beneﬁt Sudanese refugee students. The
effort netted $450 from SAGA.

The Senate has again endorsed a
proposal to have a fast on Friday,
April 21, for the same cause. Signrup
lists will be sent to each hall for stu<
dents who wish to participate.

Student sympathizers, led by John
Garang dc Mabior, have been able
so far to sponsor eight students in high
schools in Africa, paying $750 annually
for their education. in addition to this,
de Mahior has been making efforts to
ralse enough money to bring some stu-
dents to us. colleges. He hopes two
or three students will be able to come
next tall, probably at least one to

Grinneli. He will have raised enough '

money by then to cover room and board
Costs for at least two students. Tuition
will be waived by the colleges concerned.

Money from the April 21 fast will

mainly be used to defer part oi the
solo transportation cost ior each stu-
dent who comes,

Senate in retrospect

By Bond Faulwell
Former Speaker of the Senate

This year has, in many ways, been a
most successiul one for a newly re-
established Senate which had to struggle
against the burden or lack nl experience
resulting irom last year's experiment
without a senate. Under this senate we
saw the passage oi such items vital lo
student interest as the abolition of wom—
en‘s hours and the adoption or a new
court system. However, the real work
of the senate takes place in its commil-
tees and not on the floor of the senate
iiseli. in order to make the student body
more cognizant of this fact, i would like
to deal with a iew of the highlights of
the work of this year's committees.

Admissions Committee

I would first like to examine those
committees which were created pri-
marily to voice student opinion to the
faculty and administration. One such
committee was the Admissions Commit-
too which worked very closely with DI‘
rector of Admissions Dale Terry. This
committee has been instrumental in in-
ltiating a “personal Contact” program in
which Grinnell students contact prospec-
tlve students over vacation periods and
eat dinner with them when they are on
campus.

other achievements of the group in-
clude the compilation of a Tour Guide
Handbook, the revision or the Grinneil
Education pamphlet, and the distribu-
tion and tabulation or a freshman quell.
humans to aid Mr, Terry.

Curricular Affairs

The Curricular Afiairs Committee to
operated closely with the Faculty Com-
mittee on Educational Policy and Cur-
riullum. It related the Course evalua-
lion forms and spawned the Interim
Committee.

Library

The Library Committee also worked
with a parallel faculty committee. They
,saw to it that the library staff removed
books left overnight on the Carrels and
also made known student interest in
such things as the carpeting oi the“-
brory (which is currently being investi-
gated).

Food and Wages

Sometimes however, ii appears that a
senate commlttee is pitted against other
groups on campus. Such was the role or
the Senate Committee on Food Service
and Student Wage Scales which caused
the raising at student wages irom 3.35 to
the present 31.00-51.25 scale (which will
soon reach the $1.50 minimum pre-
scribed by the 1966 amendments to the
Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938).

Book Store
Another group that opposed an exist-
ing campus instiiulion was the Book
Store Committee. Through its efforts a
student is now on the book store staff,

more specific departmental books have
been ordered, and (at least for the sec-
ond semester) ihe problem of crowded
check-out lines was alleviated with the
interim period being used tor the pur-
chase of books. The committee has also
pointed to the need for a larger book
store and ialrer prices for the drug
store items offered for sale.

Student Services

Some senate committees aimed at
providing student services. The Student
Used aoolr Store committee supplied
books to the student body at prices iar
lower than the book store and also paid
iar more in buying them.

The Counseling Committee also strove
to improve the life oi the Grinnell stu-
dent, This committee solicited student.
faculty, and administration opinion on
the adequacy of the present psychologi-
cal counseling services available. It
made known to the administration stu-
dent feeling on the inadequacy of the ad-
visory system on South Campus and the
need for psychological facilities in Grin~
nell itself. The committee also brought
a psychiatrist, Dr. Harold Balikov, to
campus for consultation about counsel-
ing needs. Finally, this committee
enumerated what it thought were the
speciiic responsibilities or each level of
counseling open to the student body.

The Radio Station Committee studied
the role at a campus station, the type 01
programming it would offer, the space
needed for it, and its cost. The study
showed that a campus radio station can
be a reality, it there exists an available
source of funds.

Transportation

The Transportation Commlttee utilized
a student questionnaire and a careful
lnve igatlnn of existing transportation
facil ies to make several recommenda-
tions to the administration. Chief among
these were the securing of a new bus
tor the college community, more Col-
lege station wagons and the employment
of a private rental service for students.

The National Student Association
Committee continued to Carry out such
vital responsibilities as the chartered
flight to Europe, NSA insurance, repre-
sentation at major student conferences
and the providing of NBA information to
campus organizations.

Finance

The only permanent senate committee,
the Finance Committee, budgets SGA
funds. In addition to this vital respon-
sibility, this year the committee made
recommendations to the senate to ap
propriate money from General Budget
and Reserve for activities and events of
importance to the student body, This iri—
cluded such things as appropriating
money for the Sex Education Program,
Interim, the Midwest Model United Na-
tions, and the Indian Musiciansi

mediate reaction is to push tlle paper
away and not believe it,” he said. He
also cited a traditional American attitude
which leaves foreign policy decisions to
the experts, The third problem IS the iso-
lation and academic orientation of the
college itself. Mendeisohn concluded that
”It is this sort of thing (the Speak Out)
that's needed at Grinnell to get peoplo
out of the apathy trap and into the arena
of political action."

Organizers ol the Speak Out intend
to term discussion groups to continue the
study or U.S. loreign policy in Vietnam.
Laurie Woods, spokesman for the group,
also anticipates a “Beln” on Central
Campus this Spring. She described it as
“a conducive atmosphere for talk and
free relations among people. It's not a
situation that is defined by our society,
so there is no set way or reacting. it's
just it happening — you Come and be."

Over 500 colleges, universities, and
high schools, plus 100 Sioux Indians will
take part in the Spring Mobilization
to End the War in Vietnam. The Stu<
dent Mobilization Committee estimates
that this will be the largest student
demonstration yet against the war.

Similar demonstrations are being
planned on campuses across the country.
For example, students from the Univer-
sity oi Chicago will demonstrate at the
Witco napalm plant. At San Francisco
State College, movements have begun
to protest campus complicity with the
draft, to abolish ROTC and bar CIA
recruiters from the campusi

“There are many facets of the war
the public is not aware at. All we can
do is vote for representatives who we
feel are intelligent, reasonable and re
sponsible individuals and then put some
faith in them."

“You cannot run a government from
the grass roots level," Robinson con-
tinued. “The government has to be
somewhat secretive."

The countelrmubilizers also feel the

Henry Wilhelm is currently on display
at the University of lolva in Iowa City.
The exhibit, which will run through

journalistic photographs. Several oi the
photographs appeared in the last issue
of NOUS and a number of them Will

The show is hanging in the main

He feels the worir in the show “repre-

it wants this kind of thing to happen
to its students and, as lunch as pos
sible, provides for it. As part of our
study of “problems on the city level"

FWI went into actual operation not
quite two year- Ago under the auspices
of the New York Yearly Meeting, Re-
ligious Society of Friends. it won the
brainchild almost reven years before
of the Westbury (Lang island) Friends
Meeting. The guidelines set up by the
New York Yearly Meeting atipulated
that FWI be: 1) A four year liberal
arts college Quaker in spirit; 2) A
world oollege, international in charac-
ter and outreach. in 1965 the State of
New York grantod to rwr a provisional
charter which lasts for five years, dur»
ing which time the school is being de-
veloped into Friends World College.
Degrees granted during the time that
FM is not oiiiclaily a college will
he retroactively validated when FWI
receives a college charter. Rather than
having a single campus, FWI will ulti-
mately have seven campuses in differ-
ent parts of the world. Each student
will attend each of these Campuses for
six months and then return for the last
semester to his original campus to com-

lete a final thesis or project concern-
ng a specific subject he has become in-
terested in during his travels and pre-
vious study. Ultimately it is hoped that
classes will originate from each of these
seven different campuses, However, for
the present all classes are beginning
from the North American Center lo
cated near Westbury, New York, in
an old deserted air base known as
Mitchel Gardens, Headquarters of FWl
are at Harrow Hill, Long island at the
home of the director, Morris Mitchell,

former director of Putney Graduate
School. I’m writing this in Cuemovace,
Mexico. At present there is no Mexican
campus as such. Our time in Mexico
is being spent between studying Spanish
and Mexican history at the Institute and
direct living experience in lndian vil~
lager in addition to study trips to sur.
rounding points of historical and intel-
lectual interest. During the next three
years the schedule of my class at FWI
includes study and travel in Eastern
and Western Europe, Russia, Austria,
Kenya, India and Japan.

A new class begins at the North A-
merican campus every six months under
the present schedule. I'm in the third
class. The first two Classes are in
Europe, presently, while the fourth is
still at the North American Center on
Long island, The classes have varied
in size, averaging around 35. As plan-
ned they will gradually get larger
until reaching a maximum of around
100 students per class, half boys and
half girls. FWl was started as an ex—
perimental college and certainly hasn’t
left the experimental stage, At times
fhis is hard on students and faculty
alike. but it makes FWl an exciting
place. Anything can happen, While
the second class was traveling through
the southern United States in Volkswagen
buses studying racial problems and the
South in general, they temporarily
dropped their work or voter registration
in Selma, Alabama to observe (and
participate in, as it tumed out for the
majority) the Meredith March through
Mississippi. The journals of the several
FWl students who were fear gassed in
Canton, Mississippi make very inter»
esting reading. The fourth class of FWI
which is still based on the North Amen
loan campus on Long Island has just
recently altered its schedule to provide
for three weeks of working intensively
on the planning and organization of a
major national peace demonstration sat

traveling we camp out whenever poa-
rible and do our own cooking. For
longer stays such as our present month
in Cuemavaca we stay in groups of one

that area and getting a taste of the no-

In addition to several hours of ciassaa

encourgaged but never required), we
were given the opportunity for skin

to travel beyond Houston, some taking
a week to get to Mexico City and some
going directly. Several students hitch
hiked, and the rest took buses. Students
such as myself who rode in buses be
came well impressed with the necessity
of learning Spanish for efficient sur-
vival in Mexico. Crossing the border on
foot with backpacks and then getting
proper bus connections to Mexico City
required some fancy dictionary-page

such as myself.

The concept of each roll class as
I community is strongly stressed, This
is not only an efficient necessity since
each class is independent of other
classes, truly living as an independent
unit for four years, but it is a mnnue
mental learning experience of itself.
How can one expect to work toward a
world community until one has learned
to truly act out of love towards one’s
neighbor? As much as possible in a
given cultural context, our class at-
tempts to regulate itself as a social
entity. We've spent more time in "com-
munity meetings" than in any other
collective activity. For many this has
been the most significant experience
thus far. Following someone else's rules
without considering their foundations
is the easy way out A FWi community
meeting is carried out “after the man-
ner of Friends." Every one is equal;
everyone has a voice The issue is dis—
cussed. REALLY discussed. until the
“sense" of the meeting is achieved.
True communication is almost like
magic it eliminates the need for ever
voting on an issue. After honest dis-
cussion the decision, if one is required,
is obvious to everyone. Someone may
well disagree with a decision arrived
at in a meeting but they'll recognize
through the discussion why their opinion
cannot and should not he accepted by
the rest oi the meeting. Needless to
say, these meetings are often long and
difficult, but they're rewarding.

After leaving Cuernavaca in the next
few days my class will divide into two
separate groups, going to two different
Imali and relatively obscure Mexican
villages We will assist with work pr0<
)ects already begun in these villages
under local leadership. in the case of
my village, this will mean building a
road which means carrying crushed
rock from a nearby quarry and spread-
ing it on the roadbed. My village will

have no electricity, 3 minimum of
water, and a population of about 1.500,
the majority of whom have never been
exposed to North Americans in any
form. We'll be living in adobe huts and
cooking our own meals.'For six weeks
we’ll have direct and inescapable ex-
posure to the subsistence level of living
shared by twothirds of the population
at the world. We will be teaching classes
of art and English in the local school
and, in general, having an experience
not unlike the Peace Corp. Because my
special interest is in photography I look
forward to this village experience as a
unique change to intimately portray in
photographs as much as possible, the
essence of peasant culture in Mexico.

During the first semester at FWI my
class spent a week camping out in New
Hampshire just when the leaves were
turning. This was a quiet and beautiful
trip as well as an educational one; it
culminated a series of seminars back
at Mitchel Gardens on Man and Nature
and intelligent useol natural resources.
on this “New England Study Trip" we
camped near an experimental forestry
station and attended seminars concerned
specifically with forestry conservation,
This was a restful time with lots of
copies of Walden available, singing
around the fire at night and lots of
free time for individual meditation. It
was an experience on many levels; I
watched beavers working on a dam and
learned how to prune a tree; i learned
how valuable beavers are and the ne-
cessity uf pruning for proper forest con-
servation and most important or all,
1 learned that forest production over
most of the world could be doubled
and consistent production in the future
guaranteed by the mere application of
already understood techniques of forest-
ry conservation. We run into that kind
of thing quite often at FWl, an aware
ness that in any number of contexts
the sacrifice of an extra bit of effort
combined with a proper bit of knowl-
edge can provide ior the future welfare
of mankind rather than lGNORiNG it.
perhaps atter four years at FWI all
that l'll really be aware of for sure
is that two thirds of the population of
the world is barely surviving from one
day to the next simply because of
hunger, and disease, while the other
third of the world has the means of
both helping to correct this situation
and of literally destroying the whole
world. But of course. , .everyone knows

education, however, FW! makes an in-
teresting distinction between knowledge
and awareness; KNOWLEDGE is what
you have when you’ve mastered facts
and theories while AWARENESS is what
has happened when an individual is
somehow motivated to act on his knowl-
edge in a rational and human way.
Awareness has an extra and almost
mysterious element: you might call it
emotion, or even love. i . FWI is
dedicated, as an educational institution,
to the increased awareness of its stu-
dents to the very real problems which
presently face mankind. At the same
time, FWI hopes that its students will
become motivated to achieve in what-
ever way they are able, the hard facts
required for the execution of the spe-
cific discipline through which they want
to express their “awareness." This is
openly recognized as one of HIV:
major problems at present. While the
“freedom” from requirements is con-
sidered a necessity for a student's
growth to be correctly motivated and
for him to learn to TRULY think for

after receiving a formalized education,
Uninvolvement is a difficult habit to
shake. In the words of director, More
rls Mitchell, FWI is a school designed
to produce “agents of social change"
and in the process teach the "joy of
purpose.” The JOY of purpose. If you
can give someone these sorts of oriem
tation then formal. traditional education
will become a means to specific ends
and not a "necessary evil" or even
worse, an end in itself. The problems
that our generation faces, if it once
face them, are war, race prejudice,
waste of natural resources, hunger.
housing, education, population explo-
sion, pollution of air and water, poverty
amidst afﬂuence and in general, a dis-
astmus intolerance of and insensitivity
to both local and foreign cultural pat-
terns which in any way deviate from
the familiar. These problems are the
subject matter of FWI. The fact that
students in general in the United States
have one of the softest and least influen-
tial voices of any student group in the
entire world is frightening testimony to
the apathetic and often times down-
right selfish attitude that American ed-
ucation is giving to its products. Ever
increasing affluence in the US. is used
as a sort of perverted excuse for ever
escalating greed rather than being taken
as a responsibility and opportunity for
the furthering of the humanity of men
everywhere Whatever disadvantages
its approach may involve FWI hopes to

avoid this trend and give to its stu-

dents an awareness at the truly cone
structive potential of both wealth and
knowledge.

lSli: ls Reaction What's Happening?

By Craig Allin

A resolution for the impeachment and
removal from office of Donald Smith,
Iowa State University student body
president, was Introduced In their stu-
dent senate Tuesday night and was
tabled pending the outcome of a stu.
dent referendum.

The impeachment proceedings were
brought against Smith by Roger Christen»
sen, Vice chairman of the Senate. The
proceedings stemmed'froirl a story re-
leased by the Iowa State Daily, which
stated that Smith had attended a party
where marijuana was smoked and
that a photographer from Life maga-
Zine was also present. it would ap—
pear that the resolution of impeachment
is only the most recent episode in a
power struggle which has engaged sev-
eral members of the ISU Government
of the Student Body (GSB) ever since
Smith’s election.

Tuesday, March 16, Smith appeared,
clad in sweatshirt, bearded, sockless.
and unlaced, to deliver his State of
the Campus Address to the student
senate. He criticized current trends in
university education. “Theoretically,"
said Smith, “universities are servants
of the truth, but they are becoming
servants at industry and the military."
He presented his program in a Bill of
Rights calling for student regulation of
all activities outside the classroom. The
preamble states, “It is the job of the
administration to supply the student
with the best instructors and facilities
possible. It is not the job of the ad-
ministration to regulate the personal
lives of the student body."

Point one of his five part program
may strike a familiar chord among
Grinnellians. it states, “NO student
shall be expelled or suspended except
for academic failure." Other points deal
with dormitory regulations, release of
grades. and student government finances.

President Smith claims that there was
talk of his impeachment the night of
his election and that opposition has not
grown signiticantly in the wake of the
marijuana storyr Those supporting the
impeachment feel that Smith’s support
among students has been eroded.

It is significant that the impeachment
charges, while they have been instigated
by the forces of political conservatism,
have not maligned the Smith program
as stated in the Bill of Rights. The
attacks on Smith have rather been of
a personal or emotional nature, center-
ing around the vague charge of violation
of the best interests of the university.

Specifically Smith has been charged
-With the use of "narcotic drugs that
are illegal.” i.e,, marijuana; with “gross
derogation of the Iowa General Assem~
lily," a reference to his remark that

contraception might have limited the
number of “bastards” in the Iowa legis-
lature; end with pursuing a disruptive
course of conduct with regard to the
news media. It Is charged that these
acts “constitute malfeasance in the
duties and responsibilities related to the
office."

Evidence brought to prove malfeasance
consisted mostly of quotations from
alumni and legislators stating a dis-
satisfaction \vith the “new ISU image."

The issues are further clouded by
unusual procedure and by speculation
as to the motives of some of the
principal characters. The ISU student
senate represents s p e c i a1 interests,
e.g,, the lnteriraternity Council or the
College of Veternary Medicine, This helps
explain how Smith, who was elected
at large, could receive over 40 per cent
of the vote among four candidates and
simultaneously be presented with a Sen<
ate made up of only tour Smith support-
ers or a total oi nineteen members. Only
about half the campus cast ballots in the
recent election and there is some reason
to believe that many signing the im-
peachment petitions had not; voted when
the opportunity existed.

Senator Christensen, who introduced
the impeachment resolution, stood. un-
til Tuesday night, third in the line of
succession to Smith's position. This is
important in the light of a statement
by Mary Lou Lifka, student body vice
president, second in succession and a
Smith supporter, that she would resign
if Smith was removed from officer in
order to demonstrate the apolitical
nature of his intentions, Christensen of-
fered to resign his position in the line
of succession.

The resultant situation is interesting
i n d e e d . If Smith is removed from
Office, there will be no one to succeed
him. Under these circumstances, it is
the prerogative of the senate to elect
a president from among its own .ranks.
The final irony is that even the majority
of the conservative faction Within the
senate appears to be splitting, and not
without some political backstabbing. It
would seem that while their battle is
not yet won, the anti-Smith forces have
already fallen to fighting over the
spoils.

A referendum scheduled for today,
which Smith felt would indicate that a
majority supported him, was canceled
by the Student Supreme Court because
the courtfelt it would introduce prejudi-
cial evidence in the impeachment trial.
It is evident that the anti-Smith coalition
has the votes it needs to require re-
moval. The senate faction has nothing
to lose; the senators, unlike the presi-

dent, are not subject to recall by their ,

constituents.

keeps you from running into problems
which might arise.”

Smith’s speech is plain When he use!
big words, it just doesn't sound right.
He rarely uses cliches. When he Is ire
ritated or mad, he doesn't raise his voice
or change its quality greatly. The change
in his voice is subtle yet noticeable,

In an interview with the Iowa State
belly, Smith was asked what his par-
ents think of all that has happened to
him. ”Ick.” he replied. He further ex-
plained that he had gotten on poorly
with his parents even before his elec-
tion, though for the iirst seventeen years
of his life he attended church regularly.
“Primarily it is because my dad is such
a staunch Catholic. I don‘t go along
with all that moral shit.” He now calls
himself an ”agnostic."

If he is impeached. and it now ap

pears likely, Smith is a prime candle
date for martyrdom. He has the dev0<
tion of a large segment of the interested
students, and as an Iowa State stu-
dent leader, he seems to be the only
prominent one not acting out of
selfish motives. He might be seen as
the idealist come to grief.

"The betrayal oi my trust by certain
reporters and the following sensational
journalism has brought to lite the tact
that i have smoked marijuana, i do
not deny this I do not deny that this
limits my eilectiveness as president or
the student body.

“I realize that I will be closely

of cases where marIJuana was planted

legal drugs that narcotics agents could

that they bring in themselves. I will

iuana."

who they could live with. This means
that they can’t make girls live in the
dorms if they don’t want to. And I
think of what's left. the most important
thing i want to see passed is the part
about not allowing the university to ex-
pel any student except for academic
failure.

REPORTER: How much effect doe:
any senate action have on the admins
istratlon of the university?

SMITH: Legally, it’s only a recom-
mendation, but I think that if we get
the students behind us we can get
these changes brought about.

REPORTER: Many pe rso n s have
charged you with inaction. What is your
reaction to this?

SMITH: Well, the thing is, I prom-
lsed during the campaign that if I was
elected I would try to bring all my
changes about through the normal chan-
nels. and the normal channels take
time. The student senators asked for
time to investigate all my proposals end
the Bill of Rights and that’s what
they’re doing. They’re looking into these
things before they vote yes or no.

REPORTER: Has there been any
movement to push for the removal of
restriction on the coeducational use of
dormitory rooms?

SMITH: Yes. I think that this should
be turned over to the individual dorm-
itories involved—and that would be in-
cluded in the Bill of Rights—the part
about the rules that Students live un-
der, a part that has not been passed
yeti

REPORTER: DO you think student
opposition to you will hurt your pm
grams?

SMITH: Most opposition has been, at
least supposedly, on the marijuana

nor does it necessarily lead to hard
narcotics. The primary reason it is
illegal is that the legalization would
greatly harm the liquor industry, which
carries a large amount of financial and
political power."

“I have also been accused by those
in the New Lelt of not devoting enough
work to my office. i do not feel that
I can or should staiitl alone to defend
my belieis or implement my programs.
Why have you New Leit students not
contacted your senators about my pro«
grams? Where were you when Presie
dent Parks criticized my Bill of Rights?
Why haven‘t you written letters to the
Daily? Iriow many students outside the
New Left ilave you spoken with? — l
am only human. I can‘t do all of these
things alone."

thing and not on the basis of my pro-
grams.

REPORTER: What do you think will
happen to the effort to impeach your

SMITH: Well, the senate has alwayl
stressed that they want time to inves-
tigate anything they do and as for an
the impeachment is concerned, the Sell.-
stors I’ve talked to are going to table
it at least tor a week to discuss it
and let this thing cool off before they
reach any definite decision.

REPORTER: would you say that til!
elements which are aiming at impeach-
ment are elements that feel that the
situation has changed since the election
or have these elements been diametric-
ally opposed to you throughout the cam-
paign?

SMITH: The people who are trying
to impeach me are overwhelmingly pm
pie who have always been diametrically
opposed to me.

REPORTER: What is your general
philosophy about student life?

SMITH: Well. we’ve got 15,000 stu-
dents here living together in a small
group and under the present situation
we’ve got to have some rules to live
under. In the past these rules have
come down from the administration.
The students have been sort of a colony.
But what I’d like to see in the future
is Student government take over this
role of the rule»maker.

REPORTER: How far would you like
to go in this student decision makingr

SMITH: I think the eventual goal
would be With the administration just
setting up classes and telling us when
to be there,

REPORTER: Do you think that silk
dents are mature enough to handle
this freedom?

SMITH: I think they are. I think this
is the very way they’ll have to learn
to make decisions because when they
get out of college they're going to be
thrust into this position.

REPORTER: What is the relationship
from your point of view between the
university and the student body and
the state legislature?

SMITH: Well, a lot of criticism ill
the legislature I feel has been unfounded
and I have offered to speak to them
as a body or to any individual legis<
lator about what's happening at Iowa
State. As of yet, no legislator has ac.
cepted my invitation.
