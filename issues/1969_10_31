Controversy Gver College Role in FBI Probe

The college administration
Tucsday decided to stop acting
as an intermediary between stu7
dents and Federal Bureau of
Investigation agents who for
the past two weeks have been
Conducting an investigation of
Grinnell students involved in the
SDS demonstrations in Chicago
earlier this month.

“If FBI agents come on cam-
pus, we will not serve in an the
tormediary role," said Joseph F.
Wall. clean oi the college. Wall
told the 5&3 he had eallier ofv
lered two FBI agents the use of
a college building to question
freshman Kay Sophar and‘ her
roommates because he wanted
to protect the students from the
embarrassment of going to the
Grinnell police station. “I was
operating on what I thought

were generous instincts,” Wall
explained.

President Glenn Leggctt said
that the college’s role in the
FBI probe had been “simply
that of relaying information
from FBI agents to students"
and informing students that
they were not legally bound to
meet with the agents.

“The use of the word inter-
mediary is unfortunate." Leg-
gett said, ”because it gives the
impression we were cooperating
with the FBI in a way that we
weren't." Both Wall and Leg-
gett said that they thought they
were prov1d‘ing a service for the
students involved by relaying
the information, and were not
intentionally aiding the FBI
agents.

Mrs. Alice 0. Low. dean of

students, used the words ”inter-
mediary cdpaCity” to describe
thc college’s role in the matter
in a note sent to the students
involved.

Both chgett and Wall were
critical Thursday of a new story
about the FBI prcbe here that
appeared under a banner head-
line on the first page of Wednes-
day's (Oct. 29) DE; Moines
Register. Wail was expected to
release early today a statement
“ larifying the facts" about his
invclvemcnt in the matter.

lowa Governor Robert D. Ray
criticized the college adminis-
tration’s role in the FBI probe
during a press conference Wed-
nesday. "Schools should not be
in the FBI business," Ray said.

According to a memorandum
released by the President’s of»

{ice Tuesday, FBI agent Ells
worth Gustafson and a fellow
investigator called at the of—
lice of Dean Wall Friday,
Oct. 17, and told him they
wished to talk with Miss So-
phar and her roommates.
Wall contacted Mrs. Alice 0.
Low, dean of Students, who in
turn contacted the girls in-
volved, informed them of Gus-
tafson’s message, and told
them their legal rights. The
girls met with the agents that
day in a college office.

On Tuesday, Oct. 21, another
FBI agent called on President
Glenn Leggett. Dean Low also
attended the meeting. The
agent said he wished to talk
with 11 students whom the
5823 had identified as having
been in Chicago during the

SDS demonstrations. “The im-
portant thing to remember,”
said Leggett, “is that the FBI
already had the names. We
didn‘t give them to them.”

After consulting with the
college attorneys, Leggett and
Low agreed to contact the stu-
dents the FBI wished to see.
In a note sent to the students
involved, Dean LOW said, “The
dean’s office is acting in an
intermediary capacity only
between the current investiga-
tion conducted by the FBI and

Leggett Delays Statement
On Disruptive Protests Policy

BULLETIN‘ShC‘rily before
the son went to press,
President Glenn Leggeitt said
that after discussions with the
Judicial Council and Student
Affairs Committee, he has
decided NOT to issue a
statement on disruptive
protests at this time.

“I have questions about the
need for it and about how
it might be interpreted by
students," Leggett said. “For
the time being, the statement
is not dead, but it’s dor-
mam.”

President Glenn Leggett is
revising a draft of a state-
ment he has written concern
ing the college policy on dis-
ruptive protest. the sari; learns
ed this week. Leggett said the
statement “which is not on
procedures, but on attitudes"
may be ready for release next
week.

He explained that the “state-
ment on college responsibil-
ity” will attempt to deﬁne “at
what point the community
should draw the line” with re-
gard to disruptive protests by
students.

Leggett read the original
draft of his statement at the
Oct. 9 faculty meeting, and the
faculty Executive Council has
since made recommendations
to the president concerning re»
visions. The statement is pres-
ently being discussed by the
Judicial Council, and the final
version will be submilled to
the trustees before being re-
leased.

Leggett said that he is pro;
paring the statement because

“the executive council of the
Board of Trustees felt we
ought to have one.” He added
that the trustees first began

sued a controversial statement

merous other colleges and Uni

Profs Debate Abolishing Senior Comps

After several years of contrur
versy about the senior compra~
hensive examination, the fac-
ulty met Monday and debated
whether to abolish comps as a
general graduation r e qu i r e-
merit.

Prof. Joseph F. Wall (His-
tory), dean of the college,
placed on the floor a motion
to abolish the comprehensive
examination as a graduation re-
quirement “effective for the
class of 1970."

Wall told the faculty that
after debating the motion for
11/2 hours, the faculty’s Execu-
tive Council was divided evenly
on the question, with five mem-
bers favoring the abolition of
comps and five others opposed.

“In some respects that was
good," Wall said, "because
now there is no pressure from
the Executive Council (on how
the faculty should vote). We
must get a decision within the
next week or two."

Wall also told the faculty that
the three divisional educational
policy committees had been
divided on the issue of compre-
hensive examinations. The
Humanities Divisional EPC res
commended that the comp rc~
quirement be maintained, while
the Social Studies and Science
Divisonal EPC’s recommended
that it be abolished.

Asst. Prof. John H. Worley
(Philosophy), faculty secretary,
read a proposal which he will
offer as an amendment to the
present motion at next Mon-
day's faculty meeting. The pros
posal would allow individual des
partments to replace the
present comp requirement with
programs that “could consist of
a comprehensive examination,
a theSis or paper, a particular
course or seminar, a research
project, a public performance,
or any combination of these."
Such programs would be either
required or optional, but if

passing them is a graduation
requirement for majors, they
“must be accepted by the Di-
visional EFC, the Executive
Council, and appear in the col-
lege catalog.”

Wall said that the comp issue
was “fundamental to the basic
issue of college policy and the
reason for the existence of the
college itself.” He explained
that the Executive Council dis-
cussed the issue dn the level
of whether Grinnell’s purpose
is to provide only a broad and
diverse liberal education, or
whether it does, or should. also
provide high quality pie-pro
fessional training.

During debate on the motion
to abolish comps at Monday’s
meeting, the faculty appeared
to be divided on the issue for
various reasons.

P r o i . Morris Parslow
(French) defended the compre-

hensive examination because it
“evaluates the student’s ability
to define and to operate in his
field and to see the relationship
of that field to the general lib-
eral arts in a wide perspec-
tive."

"I'm against comprehensive
examinations as a general We
quiremenl." Prol. Irwin Gold-
berg (Sociology) told the
faculty. “Leaving the require
ment to each department would
allow the departments to do
what's best for the student.”
Goldberg said Grinnell should
“prepare our students for the
world into which they are
moving” by aiding in "occur
patioual placement and self-
fulfillment." He said that
comps don't serve those pur-
poses in his discipline, and

Frank, objected. "We want you
to stay out or this altogether,"
lie said. Most oI the students
nrcsent agreed with Frank.
“Just by calling this meeting
you're getting more involved
than you have to be. If the
FBI calls again we want you
to tell them you aren‘t going
to do anything,” Frank added.

Dean Low responded that
what the dean‘s office did the
next time the FBI called would
depend ”on the circum-
stances." The Clean oi students
also advised the students of
their legal rights, including
their right not to even see the
FBI unless subpr‘naed. Dean
Low gave the students the
FBI number in Des Moines
and told them they could “call

to the agents. She also iniorm-
ed the students that the col-
lege would not turnlsh any stu—

legally ioroed to do so. “Even
in that case we would probably
fight it,” Said Low.

dents met with Leggett Tues-
day atternoon to ask that the
college cease its “intermediary

the meeting. Both Leggett and
Wall later told the 8&3 that

“I think the college still has
an obligation to tell a student
that the FBI is looking for him
it we know that. Also, just as
the college provides counsel-
ling on dratt iniormation. we
have an obligation, ! think, to
advise students of their legal
rights.” said Wall.

“We have asked the FBI to
notify us it they will be on
campus,” added Leggett. “in
this way we can hopefully
contact students and advise
them of their rights before
they are contacted by the
FBI."

According to
who had talked with FBI
agents, the investigators are
looking into the possibility of

a federal offense under which
the Conspiracy 8, national
anti»war leaders, are current

FBI Cooperation llnwise

This week President Glenn Leggett announced that the college
“would no longer act in an intermediary capacity" between the
FBI and Grinnell Students. The college will continue to offer stu-
dents advice concerning their legal rights. This policy is to be

commended.

Although we recognize the college's “sincere concern" for the
wellare of students that prompted them to call students and relay
information (mm the FBI. the college must not become involved
in those situations that are essentially matters between students
and legal authorities. Such involvement jeopardizes the college
and may easily become detrimental to the student

If Grinnell is to truly develop “mature. thinking individuals,"
students must neither expect nor receive the well-intentioned pro-

tection oi the college.

The new policy of the college in this area recognizes the dis-
tinctions between “in loco parentis” and the legitimate counsel-
ing function of the institution. This distinction must be main-

tained.

Abolish Comps Now

On Monday the iarulty is expected to come to a vote on the
question or abolishing the senior comprehensive examination. The
scope of arguments on both sides prevents repetition here.

The present comprehensive examination,

an archaic and

meaningless requirement in its present form. should be abolished

immediately.

Kenn Yedcrsen, turn

a common challenge for the in-
ture: to accept the fact that the
world is not an ideal dwelling
place; and to work to bring it
closer to the ideal which we
must establish for the next
generation. as our parents have
done before us, Certainly those
who have been hrandcd conser-
vatives can see our link with
the past; likewise. those who
are named liberals can see our
connection with the tuture, 1t
wc can perceive continuity be
tween generations. then why
have wc so failed to recognize
the similarities with n our own
generation? Why, even among
coitege students. is there so
much resentment and apparent
disagreement?

The answer :les in our self
evasion. We are surrounded so
closely by so many people who,
alter all. are so like us. that we
feel the need to individualize—
if not individually, then in
groups. In other words. we
want to be different from our—
selves. The result is several
clusters of people. grouped
around {also images. which have
become cults or teiishes. Each
or us is classified according to
the length or his hair, or by
the arm band that he wears, or
refuses to wear, The image
identifies the person as a mem.
ber of a particular faction. and
tends to alienate others who
do not look or act as he does,
We have thus individualizcd
ourselves ‘ albeit in groups 7
almost to the point or forget
ting our common heritage. itself
paradoxically the cause or our
separation.

What is to be done? How are
wcto putinto practice
the harmony that we preach in
theory? Perhaps we should
abandon all attiliations Indeed.
a recent article in the Des
Moincs Register has suggested
that the principal stimulus ror
war is man’s mass devotion to
various causcs. Yet. a universal
rcnnneiat on of human devotion.
even it it were possible. would
scvci- all tics among us. leaving
only chaos and greater aliena-
tion. We would be fighting a
cold war or apathy among indi-
viduals, rather than a hot war
oi interests among factions. and
no one would be the winner.

We must therefore. ﬁnd

ideals that we can share, as
universally as possible. instead
of joining a group to find a
ready-made identity. we must
search ourselves individually.
to discern what it is we really
believe. Only then can we do.
clare ourselves according to the
origins that have tormed us.
and the needs which call us
iorward Because of the simi-
larities among us. we would
probably find that we agree
with each other more than we
had realized. Hopefully. then.
we would understand that it is
not our various costumes and
political labels that are of ultir
mate importance; but rather the
common sympathies which lie
beneath them.

Let me say that i realize the
issue has been oversimpliﬁed
here; otherwise, i could not
have discussed it so brieily.
What I would lke to know is:
do you agree with what i have
said? Do you disagree? Why?
I'm not looking to start a tight
_neccssarily~lust some com-
munication. Without it. there
is no cure for the isolation
which i have described. and

PIONEERS SPLIT;
3RD IN CONFERENCE
By Steve Wells

The Grinnell football squad
split its last two games, beating
Beloit 26-7 in the homecoming
match while losing last week to
Goa 3577.

The highpoints of the home-
coming battle were the tough
defense and hard running or
the Pioneers. The defensive
unit gave up only 34 passing
yards and allowed Beloit to
cross the 50-yard line only
three times. John Robinson,
Roy Lewis and Mario Bogs
nanno combined for 230 yards
rushing to help give the Pio»
lleers their best ground game
of the season.

Robinson was the surprise of
the ball game gaining 103 yards
rushing and picking up another
66 yards on a screen pass.

Coe's high-powered offensive
unit struck quickly in last Sat-
urday’s game giving the Ko
hawks a 2H) lead early in the
second quarter.

Roy Lewis got Grinnell on the
scoreboard in the second quar~
ter with a four~yard run but a
minute later Coe scored on a
30ryard pass to Mike l-larris.
