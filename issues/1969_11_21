complete Text of Leggett’s
State of the College Speech

(At last Monday’s faculty meeting President Glenn Leg-
gett delivered an address on what he called “the state of the
college.” The complete text of his remarks is published below.)

I want to talk with you about the state of the College as I see
it. This means I will be talking about some of our problems—fi-
nancial, educational, and psychological, I may spread some gloom
and probably some resentment, but here and there there may be
a glimmer of hope and good nature.

All colleges are in trouble. The better colleges are in more
trouble than the others, chiefly because their expectationsare
higher and thus harder to realize and more expensive, partly
because it is the nature of a superior faculty and student body to
invite trouble more efficiently than the nature of a second-rate
faculty and student body. But the fact that we have partners in
trouble is cold comfort for us here in Grinnell. This is where we
live; this is the environment that works on our personal and pro-
fessional nerveendings; this is where our problems have to be
solved.

You already have some information about our financial prob-
lems, On September 26, I sent you my interpretation of the trus-
tees’ meeting of September 17, in which the trustees posed certain
questions for study by the faculty. These questions, all inter-re-
lated, concerned the financial ramifications of different student-
faculty ratios, of the relationship of the comprehensive student fee
to the actual cost of a student's education, of an increase in en-
rollment, and of a cutback in administrative services. Deans Wall
and Walker, with the assistance of Professor Voertman of econ-
omics and Professor Mullins of Mathematics have already begun
to develop the necessary models of analysis for such studies; and
my understanding is that the computer will shortly be bringing
forth the data which will help us form our recommendations to
the trustees at their June, 197D,_ meeting. Though analysis and stu-
dy will not resolve our financial problems, they will at least define
them more accurately than ever before. In the meantime, our
development people and appropriate staff and faculty persons are
hard at work devising more and better stratagems for raising
funds. The effort is CrucialI for like all colleges, we face the fact
of an increasing discrepancy between our ability to spend money
and our ability to find it. Luckily, we have, because of our en-
dowment and the nature of our trustees, more resilency than most
colleges, We should appreciate this circumstance, so long as we
realize that the oratory of austerity as practiced by Dean Walker
has a necessary accuracy about it. If you have resentments about
this hard fact. take them out not on Dean Walker, but rather on
the fact of national inflation, on a federal government which can-
not decide what its obligations are, and on a war that is chewing
up both bodies and minds and is dangerously close to making
psychopaths of us all.

The problem of simple educational sanity, let alone educational
direction and leadership, in such an unhappy climate, is almost
beyond description. Faculty are jittery or self-righteous; students
are bewildered or angry; parents are confused or outraged; alumni
are indignant or puzzled. Trustees wonder why they bothered in the
first place. Presidents and deans, who by nature like to begin
each morning with a semblance of orderly purpose and a minor
flexing of executive muscles, discover every day that once again
there is time only to strategize about emergencies and time only
to devote their weary muscles to the unhappy routine of academic
stable-keeping. l overstate the circumstances, by about one per—
cent. We cannot do much about resolving this national agony, and
we cannot avoid being profoundly affected by it. But we can make
a better effort than we have to bring a measure of sanity into our
own operation.

How do we start such an effort? We start by defining our pri-
orities, then move to describing the obligations that are attached
to these priorities, and then to parceling out our time and energy
accordingly. The first priority of this institution is to offer superior
undergraduate education. Superior undergraduate education is not
primarily a matter of curricular manipulation; it is mostly a mat-
ter of superior faculty teaching superior students. This means that
our first energies need to go into the recruiting and retension of
superior faculty and into the searching out of superior high school
graduates and into keeping them working hard and constructively
after they get here. This process also implies the obligation to dis—
courage from remaining here those faculty and students who for
whatever reasons do not meet the standards we commit ourselves
to. A great deal of our energy is already going into this priority
of searching out and retaining good faculty and good students, and
quite successfully so. As yet not enough is going into the hard-

beaded application of the measuring-up process and the decisive

Four Ptero Venders Busted

Four persons, including one
Grinnell student and two alum-
ni, were arrested in Cedar Falls
Wednesday afternoon while
selling the latest issue of
Pterodactyl, Grinnell’s under—
ground newspaper.

Charged wlih distributing ob-
scene matter were sophomore
Jacob Alfred Margolin, 19, of
Metuchen, N.J.; Krystyna Neu-
man, 22, of Grinnell, a 1968
graduate; Catherine Reed Leda
er, 22. of Allen Park, Mich, a
1969 graduate; and Robert D.
Hoenig, 18. of Metuchen, N

According to Cedar Falls po-
lice, the four were arrested
about 2 pm. at the intersection
of 23rd and College near the

University of Northern lowa
campus after police received a
complaint that they were selling
obscene material.

The four were arraigned in
the Municipal Court of Cedar
Falls late Wednesday afternoon
and were released on their own
recognizance upon their promise
to appear for a hearing sched-
lued for 4 pm. Thursday.

They were charged under a
state obscenity statute which
provides for a maximum penalv
ty of one year’s imprisonment
or a fine not exceeding one
"10qude dollars.

The allegedly obscene issue
included a full-page photograph
depicting a male youth

 

Five Hundred Dollar Theft
During Sweetwater Concert

By Mark Sableman

More than five hundred dol-
lars in clothes and cash was
stolen from the Darby dress-
ing room of the Sweetwater
band during their concert here
last Saturday.

Although the College social
committee is not legally bound
to pay for the loss, it expects
to make some kind of settle—
ment with Sweetwater "to in-
sure good relations," accord-
ing to Social Coordinator Jon
Stein.

The incident illustrates the
growing amount of larceny on
campus, and the related prob—
lem of security at concerts and
dances.

There was actually more
security at the dance Saturday
than was required under the
contract w i t h Sweetwater,
since one Grinnell auxiliary po-
liceman was hired to watch
the dressing room area.

There were also the normal
two policemen outside Darby
to keep “outsiders” out of the
dance.

Nevertheless, in between the
rounds of the policeman in-
side, the dressing room was
broken into, and three leather
coats valued at $50 each, one
valued at $290, and $70 in cash
were taken.

The theft was reported to
Grinnell police, but they told
the 5&3 that they have no
leads as yet.

A number of people from
towns as far away as Cedar
Rapids and Newton were ob-
served at the dance, and some
suspect these outsiders pulled
off the theft.

Social coordinator Jon Stein
told the 5&3 that he recog-
nized more than twenty people
at the concert as definitely
college students or

Stein also mentioned that, be-
fore the Sweetwater concert,
he had seen three of these
“outsiders” using the tele-
phone in the dressing room. He
told them to leave, since he
needed to use the phone to call
Sweetwater in Des Moines.
Sometime after Stein had made
his telephone call and left, the
phone was taken from the
dressing room,

(Later that evening, four
boys from Newton were picked
up by police and charged with
disturbing the peace, and ille-
gal possession of beer. When
the police picked them up, they
had the phone from Darby in
their possession, They were

Police reported Wednesday
that they did not seek prior
adjudication that the material
was obscene before they made
the arrests. “It was obscene be-
cause it showed a naked man,"
Sgt. Peterson of the Cedar Falls
police told the 5&3.

Last year, state agents were
ordered to return allegedly
obscene Plero material that
they had seized at a Wilton
Junction printing shop. A dis
trict court judge ruled that the
seizure was illegal because
there had been no prior adjudi-
cation that the material was ob-
scene. A Pterodactyl suit a-

Ptero staff member Henry
Wilhelm said that numerous re—
tail outlets have stopped se
ing the latest issue, although it '
is Still being circulated on cam-
pus.

David Danforth, a clerk at the
Varsity Newstand in Grinnell,
said that he stopped selling
Ptero “because of what hap-
pened in Cedar Falls." Danforth
also said that he was Visited by
law enforcement officials Thurs—
day morning regarding Ptero,
but would make no further com-
ment.

Movie Previews:

“Olympiad” & “The White Zombie”

By Jon Stein

This‘weekénd's movE will be
”Tokyo Olympiad" and “The
White Zombie." “Tokyo Olym-
pia " will be shown Friday at
9:30 pm. and Saturday at 8:30
pm. "The White Zombie" will
be shown at 10:30 p.m. Sat»
urday and at 8:00 pm. on Sun-
day,

“Tokyo Olympiad," directed
by Kori Ichikawa (“Fires on
the Plain"), is a 93—minute col-
or documentary on the 1964
Olympics. it is not merely a
sports film, but a magnificent-
ly executed cinematic ode to
the human body and spirit.
Much of the film is pure mon-
tage, borrowing liberally from
Riefenstahl and Eisenstein.
The photography is stunning,
employing a number of spe-
cial effects, such as strobe
shots of the gymnasts, exten«
“£1159 of slow motion, and

for all

Pioneers

some remarkable closeups.

“The White Zombie,” is a su~
perior horror iilm, it was
made during the early Thirties,
the socalled “golden age of

horror film,” Lon Chaney Sr,
was originally scheduled for
the starring role, but because
of his death (still a mystery) it
was given to Bela Lugosi, the
Hungarian actor who had been
brought to the U.S, to star in
“Dracula" (1931). This lS a
“good guy-bad guy” film (hiss),
yet devoid of mood music and
special effects. Yay!

“Notorious," next Wednesday
night at 3:30, is a Hitchcock
film with lngrid Bergman, Cary
Grant, and Claude Rains. More
a study of relationships than
a straight thriller, this is one
of Hitchcock’s best films.

tried in Justice of the Peace
court in Grinnell and 'each
fined $100 on the possession of
beer charge.)

Presently, the Grinnell auxs
iliary police are relied on for
security at concerts and dances
in Darby and the Forum.

Stein pointed out that in
many ways this is not the best
security system, since the
auxiliary police cannot effec-
tively keep outsiders from col-
lege activities.

He also mentioned the high
cost of using the auxiliary por
lice: to guard the Darby dress-
ing room effectively, three or
four policemen (instead of one)
would be needed, and they cost
$15 per man per night.

Thus increasing this kind
of security to the point where
it might be effective would
mean one less concert or
dance each year, Stein said.

Stein suggested that a dif-
ferent kind of security system
be considered, possibly elim-
inating the unnecessary uni-
forms a and guns — of the
auxiliary police, and making
use of student ID cards.

Although he foresaw possible
student opposition to any such
“tightening of security," Stein
said that Grinnell students
”just have to start asking
themselves if we aren't getting
to be a place where you can’t
trust everybody.”

by Henry Scheff

The senate Tuesday night
e n d o r s e d the following
resolution presented by the
Steering Committee for the
Student Position Paper:

“Toward the end of greatly
expanded participation in the
governance of Grinnell College,
we students submit the
following guidelines:

1) Academic policy should be
determined by the faculty and
the students equally. Personnel
matters should be left to the
faculty.

2) Social rules and their
enforcement should be deter
mined by a body having a
student majority,

3) Community service policies
d i r e ct l y allecting students
should be opened to expanded
student participation.

4) Counseling services should
be determined with fifty per-
cent student representation.”

This resolution was sub-
mitted to the student body in
a relerendum today. The reso-
lution is intended to serve
as a basic guideline for the
Steering Committee in its
discussion with the faculty. In
another resolution the Senate
recommended that the Steering
Committee replace the 5
student members presently on
the Student—Faculty
Organization Committw,
chaired by Mr. Betts. The
senate felt that this was ap
propriate since the Steering
Committee is made up of the
elected representatives of the
Student Position Paper.

in other action an election
board consisting of senators
Aldrich, Broadwell, Stranger,
and Thomas was appointed to
run the election to fill the va-
cancy in the senate when Lynn
Aldrich leaves the college at
the end of the semester. Also,
one position will be open on
the Campus Judicial Council.
Interested persons should see
the student coordinator or Jim
Lew.

A large amount of damage
in the halls is becoming a
major problem for SGA. The
present policy on assessing stu-
dents for hall damage is that
persons responsible for the
damage will foot the bill, if they
can be identified. If not. the
hall will pay the bill, If the
hall refuses to pay, the money
will come out of next year's
student government funck,
according to Dean Waldo
Walker. As a deterrent to halls

. ' On Main Sf.”

refusing to pay for damages,
the senate adopted a resolution
proposed by Andrew Brill to the
effect that halls that have out-
standing damago debts will be
eligible for initiative funds for
hall functions only with the alps
proval or the senate, and in
exceptional cases. Halls with
large debts will find it very
difficult to get initiative funds
in the future,

Senators, House Presidents,
and VicerPresidents are author-
ized to fine students 51 for
cutting SAGA lines. Names of
fined students should be sub
mitted to the Student Auditor
so that he may bill the guilty
student. _

Social Coodrinator Jon Stein
is looking for interested stu-
dents to form a Coffee House
Committee to investigate the
possibility or putting the Forum
Coffeehouse to some use,
perhaps serving food and en-
couraging student entertainers
to perform there. if you are
interested see Jeri Stein soon,
as he wants to get things set
up for next semester.

Finally, the senate had a 45-
minute debate on the "drinking
problem” here at Grinnell
(didn’t know we had one, did
you?) According to Ric MacV
Dowell, the Administration and
certain staff are uptight about
students drinking in public,
such as occurred on that warm
fall day a couple of weeks ago
on central campus. The consen-
sus of the senate was that this
is covered by state law, and
the students should be responsi-
ble for their acts, A ruling on
this, it was felt, would just be
another rule in loco parentis (or
“in parentis loco," as Steve
Schwartz put it). I hereby take
it upon myself to inform the
student body that drinking is
a nono because it is against
the law. Thus, when you drink
in public, I urge you not to
get caught by police or un-
friendly administrators! If you
think this is worthless advice,
talk to our illustrious Assistant
Student Coordinator Steve Sch-
Wartz.

canadian Exhibit

“Recent Prints: Canada," an
Exhibition of 47 works by
Canadian painters and sculp
tors, opens Saturday (Nov. 22)
at the Scheafter Gallery in
Grinnell’s Fine Arts Center.

The exhibition, which con-
tinues through Dec. 18. was
organized by the Museum of
Modern Art in New York City
in 1967 in honor of the Canadian
Centennial.

“This highly selective survey
suggests the vitality, excite-
ment, and variety of Canadian
art today,” said William S.
Lieberman, director of the
Museum of Modern Art’s
Department of Drawings and
Prints, who selected the works
with Riva Castleman, assistant
curator tor prints,

EDITORIAL 7
censors»

What you are reading may not be what I am
writing. You see, if I use certain words that the man
who owns the printing press doesn’t like, he’ll cut
them out before you even have a chance to read
them and decide for yourself whether or not they’re
appropriate.

That’s what happened last week. The man who
owns the printing press didn’t like a certain Word
in my editorial, so he simply deleted it before the
S&B went to press. He didn‘t even bother to phone
me about it; he just cut it out,

The editorial you saw last week said “Stop the
War.” But the one I originally wrote included a
word describing the War. It was a seven-letter word
that rhymes with “ducking.” The man who owns
the printing press didn’t like that word.

The man who owns the printing press is E. K.
Shaw. E. K. Shaw is the publisher of the Newton
Daily News, the company that prints the S&B. E. K.
Shaw is also the sensor of the 5&8 ~ the man who
decides what you will be allowed to read.

I went to see E. K. Shaw yesterday to find out
why he cut out that certain word. E. K. Shaw ex-
plained, ”That word is dirty." (E. K. Shaw care-
fully avoided using ”that word” throughout our
conversation.)

I asked E. K. Shaw if he believes in freedom of
the press and freedom of expression. He replied,
“Yes, but I’m not going to print filthy words in my
shop."

I wasn‘t quite satisfied with E, K. Shaw’s ex-
planation, so I gave it one last fling and bluntly ask~
ed him, “What is dirty about ‘that word‘?”

E . K. Shaw turned red and sputtered, “May-
be someday when you're older you’ll understand
why that word is dirty."

I decided at that point that I didn’t want to talk
to E. K. Shaw any longer, so I left. I’m already a
day older, but I still don’t understand why ”that
word" is dirty. Maybe I’ll have to reach E. K.
Shaw’s age before I understand,

I do think I’m old enough to understand that
E. K. Shaw is part of a system that denies true free-
dom of the press to those who don’t own one. I am
also old enough to understand that E. K. Shaw is
part of a system that is. totally irrational in its re-
action to what it calls “obscenity,” I am old enough
to understand that E. K. Shaw is part of a system
that is suppressing Pterodactyl and underground
papers throughout the nation, and I’m old enough
to understand that that system kills off the Lenny
Bruces and will do its damnest to snuff out anybody
who strongly dissents from it.

I suppose E. K. Shaw will never understand
some of the things I do about the system of which
e is a part. I just hope that E. K. Shaw is young
enough that he’ll still be around to watch his system
crumble.

Perspective

By Tom Thomas

It’s Washington and every
body is getting their heads to-
gether. Marching together.
chanting together, talking to-
gether. It’s the politics of the
Woodstock Nation and it start-
ed before you ever got to DC

Every rest stop on the tum-
pikes, from Wednesday on,
was a movement center. Quick
:onversations as people stretch—
ed their legs after long drives.
Born a cigarette and trade an
underground newspaper. The
highways are filled with
freaks in painted-up VW buses.
Nobody believes the numbers
of other people that are mov7
ing with them.

Things start Thursday with
the March Against Death.
Across the river in Arlington,
people are arriving in care-
fully timed buses coming trom
the five Mobilization reception
centers. Shortly alter sundown,
the march gets underway.
Thump, thump, thump, rolllll,
it‘s like Kennedy’s funeral, a
comparison that no doubt is in
the minds of many marchers.

The first marchers are a
careful mixture of types, obr
viously chosen for the image
the Mobilization Committee
(Mobe) wants to project. The
march is led by an old social-
ist stereotype and a young
war widow. Following them
come hippies, an elderly
couple, a business executive, a
whole family, two coeds, a
couple of guys that look like
they just got back from the
McCarthy campaign. and then
some more freaks. Most are
carrying candles.

Mobe marshals are every-
where. Carefully trained, even
though some had begun to
learn only the day before, they
quietly directed the marchers
and sometimes traffic, talked
easily with police officers, and
seemed very much in control
of the sitUation. The march
stopped at each red light, and
in many instances, the police
let the marshals direct the
traffic.

As the march moved through
the night, very few onlookers
or cops seemed to be around.
Then we turned toward
Pennsylvania Avenue, march-
ing virtually next door to the
White House, The seven drums
sounded like a thousand as the
cadence echoed off marble of-
fice buildings. The cops are
now wearing white helmes,
the drums get louder, and ev<
erybody’s adrenalin flows a
little more swiftly as we get
near Tricky Dick’s big white
house (even though everybody
knows he‘s not in).

We reach the main gate and

marchers call out the name of
a slain 6.1. Some are defiant,
others solemn, some have
tears in their eyes. Many of
these first marchers are call-
ing the name of someone close,
a husband, a son, a brother:
others Carry a placard and call
the name of a man they have
never known.

Klieg lights glare as the tele-
vision cameras whirl. Over
thirty microphones record the
names of the war dead. And
in the not too distant back-
ground, a police intelligence
photographer snaps the pic-
ture of every single marcher.

The march moves on and the
Capitol, the final goal, comes
into view. As marchers realize
that it will be a while before
‘anything new happens, the
cold seems a little more ap-
parent, the winds a little more
brisk. The line is now grow-
ing, however, as onlookers join
in the procession.

Meanwhile, nattily dressed
agents in unmarked Cars care—
fully watch the protestors. One
agent, in his car, goes over
page alter page of youthful
face shots; another agent
stands under a street lamp and
scrutinizes each face as the
marchers pass.

As the march reaches Capir
tol Hill. the route goes up the
Hill to within about fifty yards
of the Capitol building, then
across, and back down to the
imposing statue of General
Grant which stands at the foot
of the Hill. In front of the
statue stand twelve empty
“coffins." Behind ﬂle coffins
stand the drummers, never
stopping the funeral cadence.

The marchers file quietly by,
depositing in the coffins the
placard inscribed with the
name of the soldier they rep-
resent. Marshals direct the
marchers to waiting buses
which will return them to
their original “centers."

For thirty—six hours the
march will continue, linally
concluding on Saturday morn-
ing. it will rain and get colder,
but the march will go on. As
1 leave the Grant statue, I can
see a constant stream of
marchers across Capitol Hill.
Looking d o w n Pennsylvania
Ave., me line goes as far as I
can see. The Mobe has created
an impressve scenario

The March Against Death
was beautifully programmed
for media presentao'on. Bell
tolling as the march starts, out
to shot of long line of march-
ers, then a dramatic sequence
as marchers call out names,
keep the drums on the sound—
track all the time. Conclude
with nighttime sequence of

candlerholding marchers place
ing names in the coffins. Beau
tiful. Also the impact of ev-
ery hourly news report on the
”protest activities" concluding
with a solemn, reporter inton-
ing “and the March Against
Death continues."

The march seemed to have
a very symbolic lunction for
those who participated —— sort
of a masochistic purification.
Two and a half hours, four
and a half miles. People are
not just getting together for
a "g r o o v y demonstration.”
They are solemn, serious. The
March Against Death sets the
tone. It’s passive, force com-
ing from the numbers, 46,000
marching the route, and the
continuity. night and day and
night and the sun rises and
the march continues, It is a
sacrifice, .a symbolic act of
committed youth, hanging
black curtains on a stage the
world is watching.

On Friday a large group as-
sembled near the Justice De-
partment for a rally in oppo-
sition to the Conspiracy 8 trial
in Chicago. About 1,000 people
heard Frank Joyce of the Con
spiracy staff explain “we’re

Hitler did in Germany in the
1930‘s was legal.”

Dr. Benjamin Spock told the
Crowd. “I think it is disgrace-
ful that the Attorney General
would prosecute these brave
young men under the law (of
conspiracy).”

It was then announced that
the group would set up a pick-
et line around three sides of
the Justice Department, located
just a short distance from the
rally site, and that a small
delegation, headed by Spock,
would try to get in to see At-
torney General John Mitchell.

Chanting “Stop the Trial" and
”Free Bobby Seale," the dem-
onstrators marched around the
building, then gathered at a gi-
gantic door as Spock sought an
appointment in vain. Deputy At-
torney General Jack L a n d a it
told Spock the staff was “too
busy with other emergencies”
to see him. Army troops were
visible inside the building, sta-
tioned in a grassy courtyard.
it was the first time troops
had been in the Justice De-
partment since World War II.

Spock told the crowd to move
back to the park for a linal
speech after which the crowd
would disperse. Dwight Mac--
Donald spoke briefly, claiming
that Judge Julius Hoffman, who
is presiding in the conspiracy
case, is holding “what you
might call axfree form trial.“

“l-lis conduct has stripped this

law of any dignity and ration-
ality it might have ever had,”
he added.

MacDonald then announced
that he, Spock, and others would
return to the Justice Depnrlr
ment to try to arrange an ap-
pointment with Mitchell and [0
turn in draft cards that had
been collected at a rally lil
Philadelphia, The crowd, at
least part of it, followed. Mobe
marshals, anxious to avoid a
confrontation, tried to clear the
area. One marshal, using a
police bullllorn, tried to para
suude the crowd to leave.

SDS organizers moved
through the crowd announcing
a march on the Saigon Em-
bassy later that night. “We're
going to reclaim that embassy
lor the true people of Vietnam,
the Provisional Revolutionary
Government,” shouted one
man, waving a Viet Cong flag.

Helmeted police cleared the
streets and lined the sidewalks.
MacDonald told the crowd that
“this is what Nixon wants——a
confrontation.” After a b o u t
thirty minutes the crowd dis
persed. A New York Weather—
man leader, fist clenched, said,
“See you all at the Saigon
embassy,"

The st rally. in support oi
the Provisional Revolutionary

duled to begin at 8:30 lll Du-

Despite p u b l i c statements
that the action would be “non-
violent," everyone there was
aware that confrontation would
not be long in coming. Many
wore helmets and many others
had gas masks.

Teargas at Dupont Circle

The temperature was near
freezing and the winds were
brisk. Nobody wanted to stay
in the Circle long and nobody
needed to be told why they
were there, At 8:40 everybody
moved out of Dupont Circle
and down Massachusetts Ave-
nue toward the Saigon cm-
bassy.

About l00 yards from the
embassy was a solid line of the
Washington police Civil Disor-
ders Unit wearing helmets and
gas masks. The loud hum ol
tear gas generators druned be—
hind the line.

After a brief stand-off,
bottles began to fly from the
crowd, crashing around the po-

lice line. At that point the po-
lice released the tear gas and
the crowd retreated back MasA
sachusetts Ave. The Crowd rce
grouped at a traffic triangle at
22nd. Q Street, and Massa»
chusetts Ave; the police line
moved to about a half block
away The demonstrators
surged toward the police line,
led by the Weathermen, and
more tear gas was released.
The crowd scattered in the
open area of the triangle, then
moved back toward Dupont
Circle.

A police motorcycle. parked
on a corner, was smashed and
set fire. A police Van which
drove through the crowd was
pelted with rocks and bottles.

By 9:30 we were all together
again in the Circle. Police ar-
rived and launched tear gas
into the Circle this time using
bazookarlike d e v i c e S. The
crowd is together this time.
People keep cool, urge others
not to run, and treat those who
have been gassed. A nearby
hotel and a church become
medical centers as people
Wash the burning gas from
their eyes and faces.

The Wind is on the side of
the people. The gas is quickly
blown out of the Circle and
the Viet Cong flags move back
to the center.

Before the evening is over
police Will gas the Circle at
least a dozen times. Although
nearly everyone gets gassed at
least once, people won't leave.
There are occasional forays
down business streets and win-
dows are smashed — selective-
ly. The Riggs National Bank
has every window smashed. A
flower shop is untouched. PoA
lice cars have their sides
caved in; passers-by are un-
harmed.

work together. How to function

you, keep cool and you won’t

Militant resistance.

The police finally leave
around midnight. The radicals
an hour later, smiling with
chattering teeth.

Most people have probably
already read quite a bit about
the Saturday march so I won’t
dwell on it for long. The mass»
ing on the Mall was chaos.
Flags were waving, people
were chanting and handing out
leaflets, others were having rev
unions from earlier peace
marches. It sort of had the at-
mosphere at a peace party.

McCarthy spoke and people
shouted Peace Now. The
march finally got under way
and slowly wound its way
down Pennsylvania Ave It
was cold but people were
happy, passing around pea»
nuts and sandwiches.

By 2:03 the grounds at the
Washington Monument were
covered with more than 400,000
people. There were so many
that all of them couldn’t even
walk the march route. The
speeches were mostly rhetoric,
a real drag, although some of
the music was great. It was
definitely cultural politics.

At about 4:15 the ”radical
splinter group,” 10,000 splint-
ers, moved out to march to
the department of injustice to
protest the conspiracy trial

and to demand freedom for
political prisoners. We march-

ed down Constitution Avenue
(dig it?) to the “domestic
pentagon" and circled the
building once. People were
supposed to be chanting “1.2,
Stop the Trial, etc." but it
was coming out “Ho, Ho, Ho Chi
Minh" and “Off the Pig.”

The crowd eventually gath-
ered around the south entrance
to the building, smashed a few
’of the first floor windows, re
placed the American flag with
an NLF banner and shouted
for Attorney General Mitchell,
watching from the fifth floor. to

Mineral Patter: The Rolling Stones

By L.

50 we all went to Chicago to
see the Rolling Stones, even
though it was at the Internation-
al Amphitheatre, and I guess we
all got what we expected—Jag-
ger running around and shaking
his thing, a lot of songs we’d
heard before and some we
hadn’t, a good but not great,
and exciting but not earthshak-
ing show. And it was worth it to
have been there, even more
than a concert; like all major
rock performances, it was the
charisma of the group, like
Cream and Hendrix and Blind
Faith, but like Dilly the Stones
can really put out now, and like
only the Stories ever could.

Because they are and always
will be the super group. The
Beatles have art, the Stones de-
pend more on emotion. Gut mu-
sic seems about the best de-
scription, no pretension, just
sound and feeling. It's these
things, my emotional reactions,
which still make me say that
the Stones are the greatest
rock group in the world, the
only ones in their class, even if
there are people I’d rather lis-
ten to on records and some I'd
rather see live. But I had to see
the Stones, we all did, and we
came away feeling not much
better but in some way fulfilled,
or at least relieved that they’re
still there.

Musically, i can’t judge the

Stones because my reaction to
them is so emotional, They did
songs that I liked and played
them well. The songs from their
new album were impressive, es-
pecially the slow and pretty
“Love in Vain” and the long
and frantic “Midnight Ram-
bier," both in the same great
style, always improving, that
they’ve had from the beginning.
They seem to have matured
just a bit, a little less pushy,
but not too much, sort of the
way a lot of us have changed.
But Jagger, for all his sex
games, lets us know that they're
with us, not just on our side, but
friends we can depend on. He
projects more warmth than I
could imagine. And if his voice
seemed more strained and less
strong than I remembered, he
hasn’t done a whirlwind tour
of one-nighters for a long time.

brought the house shouting and
dancing to their feet. Playing
with three white freaks backing
him and sounding just like his
old Chess studio group, he took
us back ten or fifteen years to
the days of our youth. He
played updated but identical
sounding versions of many of his
his, and generally zonked ev-
erybody out. And when the
Stones did “Oh Carol” you could
see how much Jagger owes to
Berry. in music as well as emo-
tional appeal to the audience
and, maybe most notably, life
style. Chuck was getting busted
inr sex and dope things when
Mick and all of us were just
kids, And the Stones couldn’t
get much earthier lyrically
then Berry did in a long, fan-
tastic version of “Reelin’ and
Rockin.’ ” The Stones, however,
live in a different world, a
white jet set world where men
ey isn’t a problem and their
public clamors out if they get
arrested,

But the world has changed

since 1966 (their last Ameri-
can tour) and so have the
Stones. Where was your head

ours, were on-and booze
and starting to be on dope, and
they still are, but now there's
the realization that somebody’s
going to have to fight back or
we can’t have all that good

-we want. So we have
Jagger singing “Street Fighting
Man" like he means it, as much
as he means “Under My
Thumb" and “Satisfaction."
And the response is not from
screaming little girls and boys
but grown men and women,
clenched fists in the air, yelling
not only words of adoration but
“All Power to the People."
(Even the Airplane sings about
Revolution Now! and get kids
in Iowa City to break police
lines.) True, those in Chicago
didn’t all read the Weatherman
leaflets, and when the show was
over they all took to the streets
and went home, not to smash
windows. But they sat in the
Amphitheatre where the Demo-
cratic pigs had held their death
rally, and smoked What little
dope they had, openly. and you
know that somewhere in the
teaming masses of freaks there
was some hope that we can get
our heads together before the
Nixons and Agnews and Tur-
ners and Lows can bring the
axes dawn on our necks.

action which must accompany it. But the
Executive Council of the Faculty and
the Academic Standing Committee are
showing signs ol vigorous assertiveness
and l intend to encourage them.

Superior Education

I spoke of superior teachers, superior
students, and superior education, as
though the word “superior" was an ab-
solute. It is not, of course; but what I
mean by a superior teacher is someone
who believes that his discipline provides
a vehicle for educating both himself and
his students, who continues to aspire to
know more than he does now, who be-
lieves that students are worth his best
preparation, who has a sense of obliga-
tion to his status as a professional man,
who has a realized or developing com-
mitment to this kind of institution, and
who has an ability to reflect all these
characteristics to his students so that,
though they may not like him personally,
they take him seriously and believe in
him as a practitioner of the discipline he
represents. Whether he writes articles
and books is somewhat baide the point.
a matter of personal drive and taste;
whether he reads to enrich himself and
thus the dimension of his preparation is
not. His views about society are also be
side the point, thus provided he does not
substitute them for the practice of his
discipline. On this matter I do not wish
to be misunderstood, N0 instructor in
times like these can escape responding
with a personal point of view to the con-
cemed idealism or honest confusion of
his students with what is happening in
the world. That response, which comes
by way of illustration and personal com-
ment, cannot be neatly separated from
his subject matter in class discussion or
lectures or conferences. It is the nature
of Grinnell teachers and students to arti-
culate their social consciences, to make
themselves relevant to their age. But a
Grinnell teacher is, ﬁrst of all a profes
sional, a teacher in a discipline, not a
full time singer of a social gospel, and
in the consideration of his own integrity,
he needs to face these hard facts.

What I mean by a superior student is
someone whose high school record indi-
cates that he is a competent learner,
who brings enough energy and modesty
to the job of learning to be educable, and
who can accept the frustrations and hos-
tilities involved in the student-teacher re-
lationship without getting the emotional
bends and crying out that the college is
cruel or thoughtless. I do not wish to say
that student complaints are always
wrong. i have no doubt that there is
some damnably dull teaching going on
in this place; that students are some-
times getting short-changed by overly
casual preparation on the part of teacha
ers, or by a teacher’s inability to re-
spond with any excitement to the real
richness of his subject matter, or by his
failure to connect it with some meaning
to other disciplines so that his students
get at least a first glimpse at what “no
eral studies" are really all about. I am
also aware that some courses remain in
the schedule simply because they appeal
to cataloguing instincts. when students
apply the word “irrelevant” to these
sorts of miseries, we ought to listen to
their complaints seriously. But if a stu-
dent means by “irrelevant” some no-
tion that a course ought primarily to
make him tecl right about his feelings,
then I don’t even know how to talk With
him, except to say, with honest sorrow,
that the question is really not whether
the college is relevant to him but wheth-
er he is relevant to the college.

Well Trained and Committed

The question of what is meant by a
superior education in an undergraduate
institution like this one is answered chief—
ly by bringing superior teachers and
students together and letting them have
a go at one another. chieﬂy, but not
solely. Curricular management does
have a part to play, provided it rests on
two assumptions: first, on the nature of

faculty competence available; and, sec-
and, on a system to control the memo
fessional biases of individual disciplines.
The first assumption is probably obvi-
ous, though I can give you a few in
stances from our newer ventures and
changed Circumstances. Urban Studies
and Religious Studies appear to be going
concerns because they are competently
staffed. Our Comparative Literature Pro-
gram seems to me to offer great pro-
mise because we happen to have on hand
a group of well-trained and committed
young men eager to try their hand at it.
If our Department of Russian Language
and Literature is successful, it will be
because Mr. Whelan and Mr. 'Magee,
with some lateral assistance from Mr.
Guroff and Mr. Kulawiec, make it so.
We cannot order any of these good things
to be done, nor can we create them
simply by drawing up handsome curri~
cular chariots. We have to have the
horses first, or at least simultaneously,
and then we can provide the administra-
tive and moral encouragement to make
them go.

Accountability

My second assumption, that of con
trolling the preprolessional biases oi
individual disciplines, is more compli-
cated. There is something to be said
for not controlling it. For one thing,
an individual discipline which does not
consist of people with strong professional
pride and energy is not worth much to
begin with. For another, the liberal arts
general educalion concept has always
been in trouble with those of its prac-
titioners who in tryilig to teach every-
thing end up teaching nothing. For still
another, graduate school faculties, in
spite of the public prattling of their deans
to the contrary, still like to see strong
pre-professional courses of study in the
transcripts of their baccalaureate appli—
cants. A college such as this one, with a
strongly professionally oriented faculty
and a substantial number of students
bound for graduate or professional school
might survive a long time by simply
turning the decisions for educational po-
licy over to individual departments. The
result would be a narrow but quite
likely, in such terms, a superior educa
tion. But such a definition of "superior"
is not the double virtues, at least po-
tentially, of both generalist and special-
ist; and this means that a system of
checksrand-balances to keep matters in
equilibrium has to be allowed to funcr
tion. This system functions here in the
recommendations of the divisional edu-
cational policy committees, in the care
ful considerations of the Executive
Council about both personnel appoint-
ments and course changes, and in the
total faculty discussion and debate about
graduation requirements. This total fa-
culty review, though sometimes wearir
some, is perhaps the most crucial ele-
ment in the system. It rests on my con-
viction, which is sometimes shaken but
never wholly dislodged, that the wisdom
of the total faculty in educational mats
ters affecting the basic direction of the
College is sounder than that of an indi~
vidual department or divismn. It seems
to me that the Worley amendment to the
Executive Council’s motion to abolish
the comprehensive examination require
ment is a Case in point. Individual disci-
plines know, or ought to know, how to
devise the most effective ways to exam-
ine their students, But they ought to
be required to justify the pedagogy of
these devices to representatives of the
whole college. This kind of accountability
gives the College the opportunity to
keep its educational policy decisions in
equilibrium. For even if that equilibrium
is fretful and constantly assailable, we
can always have at hand the ways and
means to readjust it.

A good many questions are implied in
my remarks, and knowing this faculty
and student body, I do not doubt that
questions will be raised. And so they
should be. Whatever changes in detail or
flexibilities may be wise or necessary
at its edges, my central position is that
our concern for professionalism in our
teachers, for academic orientation in our

students, and for purpose and control
in our educational policy has to repre-
sent our first priority and obligation
and has to have first call on our ener-
gies.
Emotional Climate

Our second priority and call on our
energies must go to improving the emo-
tional climate of this environment. In so
far as the climate is a result ol phy-
sical improvcrr nts, I think we are
better off than we were. The residence
halls are more comfortable, the renovar
ticn of ARI-l is progressing ahead of
schedule, the removal of the old combi-
nation service-and-heating plant has im-
proved the landscape, Other improve»
ments are on their way, though one has
to discount the fact that half-finished
improvements often look worse than no
improvements at all. By September 1 of
next year we hope to have a remodeled
bookstore, and hopeiully some signiﬁ-
cant improvements in landscaping on
the central campus. You are aware by
this time, and perhaps even amused,
by my iinickiness about the physical
looks of the place. Though some of this
iiniclnness is just plain psypchopathic
tidincss, most of it comes from my
belief that education has a better chance
in pleasant and attractive surroundings.

in so far as the emotional climate is
the result of lhe way people act and be-
have toward one another. we are better
on in some ways and worse oil in oth-
ers. The change in the pattern of resi-
dence hall living and the incorporation
of the resident advisory system repre-
sent, it seems to me, quite promising
improvements, at least when I compare
the present situation with the one that
existed previously. But the improvements
are only promising, not fully realized, or
even really tested, and we need to de-
vote some of our energies to working
with resident advisers and appropriate
student groups on systematic appraisals
of what is Working and what isn’t and
why. In all these appraisals of the resi-
dence hall system, and indeed in all Of
the faculty‘s appraisals and reapprais~
ills of the way students live and behave
on this campus, you need to be aware
of two things, First, the faculty has not
only the right but the obligation to con-
cern itself with the out—of—class life of
students, because the quality of that life
has a direct bearing on the academic
movement of this institution. Second,
the student deans, Mrs. Low and Mr,
Kimbo, have a right to know how you
are managing your concern, which
means you ought to talk with them- be-
fore assuming they are wrong or mis
guided or il‘ informed. They may be,
as all administrators are at times; but
it is sometimes the peculiar quality of
this faculty to compound college prob
lems by discussing them with everyone
first but the faculty committee chair
man and the administrators concerned.
The result frustrates answers and solu-
tions by piling them over with heaps of
rumors, second guesses, and confused
half-truths.

Liberal Campus

That was a somewhat ill-humored re~
mark, which you will either understand
completely or not at all, but it is not
truly a digression. In a small way it
lifts the edge on one of the major
problems regarding the emotional cli-
mate on this campus. This problem, to
oversimplify it, is how we can manage
on this campus to protect faculty and
student criticism and dissent and at the
same time to prevent egregious rudeness
and confrontations. To say it another
way, l think we may well be lacing the
task of defining the line between what
we, as a community of faculty and stu-
dents, want to protect as the essential
quality of a free and open campus and
what we cannot, as the same community,
tolerate or accommodate without giving
the place away. i do not want to be
an alarmist about this matter. From
many points of view, criticism and dis-
sent at Grinnell, whether directed at
the College or at the society outside,
have been managed with constructive
idealism and civilized style. The efforts
of the Black Students and the Moro-

torium group are two recent cases in
point. From some other points of view,
criticism and dissent at Grinnell, what
ever the motivation, have ranged from
the illrmannercd exhibitionist to the dis-
ruptive. So far this faculty, the deans
and I, as well as most of the student
body, have been very accommodating. it
is the nature of most members of a coir
legiate community to be patient, calmly
persuasive, perhaps even excessively tol-
erant. These qualities are reinforced by
the Grinnell tradition, which believes
that a liberal campus and a generally
permissive attitude, provide the best
kind oi environment tor developing the
proper combination oi toughmindedness
and sensitivuy in its undergraduates. I
do not want this situation to change, so
that we end up with either a tyranny
of the majority or a tyranny of the mic
nOrity.

The guidelines necessary to define
the distinctions between an Open liberal
campus and o disorderly one are very
difficult to enunciate. But I am aware
that it is the president’s job to do it
and a few weeks ago I read to this
faculty a draft of my thoughts on this
matter and then discussed them with the
Faculty Executive Council, which re
sponded favorably. But I am also aware
that such an enunciation of guidelines
has to be presented and has to argue it-
sell so persuasively that faculty and
students, or at least the greatest number
of them. will see the enunciation as
obviously sensible and timely. The
statement in question is now being re
vised and will be forthcoming shortly.
In the meantime, you can be reminded
that almost no policy position of a pres-
ident in a iacultyoriented institution
like this one will have its intended ef-
fect on the community unless you stand
by it. in a very real sense, not only
the academic direction but also the aca
demic and non-academic order of this
College rests in both your hands and
mine. The way by which we work to-
gether, talk over our differences ration-
ally, and above all, discharge our teach-
ing and other proiessional obligations is
the basic style that supports or weak-
ens the whole character of this Col
lege. With students as sensitive and in-
telligent as ours, our real if unexpressed
commitment is transparently clear and
immediately becomes our basic instruc-
tional process. Over the last generation
the exercise of our commitment has
been managed in such a style, and
with such a clear recognition of our own
accountability, that the trustees have
delegated through and with the presi—
dent of the College the real internal
governance of this institution. That dele-
gation is a conscious act of faith. not a
legal or fixed absolute, and we must
continue to earn it.

Faculty and President Acting Together

I suspect I‘ve said enough. at least for
this meeting, but I do want to tell you
that I intend to make much more fre-
quent reports and statements to this far
culty than I have in the past. Given the
pressures of the time we clearly need
now more centers of reference and focal
points for discussion. My remarks on the
emotional climate of our environment
are clearly incomplete. There is much
more to be carefully thought out and
said about this matter. One aspect of it,
for instance looms on the immediate
horizon. This is the forthcoming position
paper of the students on college governe
since. It will require our immediate at-

Women's Deliberation: An Anti-Declaration

(Robert Finley, resident ad-
viser for East and west Nur-
ris Halls, is unmarried He
wrote the following article in
response to Sally Moore’s art-
icle in last week’s 5&3 entit-

led “Women’s Liberation: A De-
claration.)

By Robert Finley

Utterly without fanfare, in a
lemon grove in Southern
California, the wisest and most
ancient sage of China, Lao Tzu,
was recently reincarnated as a
migrant farm - laborer. l-litch.
hiking across the country to
Washington, last week he stop»
ped at Grinnell for a look at
the state of the ”small liberal-
arts college” Knowing his
espousal of tenderness and non
resistance as the true way of
life, you can imagine his
reaction on reading in the 5&3
the diatribe entitled, “Women’s
Liberation: A Declaration." His
legendary imperturbability was
blown, and he was moved to
speech. ”Is this the famous
American woman?” he cried.
Such blather was unimportant
in itself, be explained, but it
distressed him that young ims
pressionable minds be poisoned
He pleaded that his views be
passed on and quickly drunk
as an antidote. He remarked
that he was pleased to see that
in California, a land where half
the marriages and in divorce,
the pendulum was swinging
backi Young women were dis-
covering the joy of being them-
selves. They were abandoning
their Ph.D.s and finding again
the joy of baking wholesome
bread, preparing nutritious
meals, of being again the center
of the home.

In all cultures and all
religions, the sage reminds us,
the universe is conceived as a
play of opposites, in China
these were called Yin Yang,
Yin being the feminine, the
feeling, expansive, subjective.
negative pole of reality, Yang,
the masculine, thinking, cone
tractivc, objective, positive
pole. All opposites are comple-
mentary. Yin cannot exist with-
out Yang, nor Yang without
Yin; but properly they are in
free interplay and balance.

Never have they been more
imbalanced than today. All our
misguided efforts to create,
through force, a Heaven on
earth, all our science and
technology, our vaunted
“victory over nature" is the
positive, Yang way it is
at last becoming obvious to all
that there is no victory over
nature, that nature has the last
word. But this truth is not so
easily seen in human relations
as in man's corruption of the
environment, or his saving
through the wonders oi
medicine millions of llves only
to doom them [0 starvation.

The Yang way is the positive,
external, extroverted, outward
seeking way, and it is this way
we extol] to high Heaven
(another word for Yang). We
would deny altogether Yin,
putting always knowledge
before wisdom, achievement
before being, compulsive ac-
tivity before observation and
understanding. ideas before

feelings, seriousness and
egotism before play and enjoy-
ment. This is pure suicide, said
the sage. All the problems of
modern life are due to this one
cause—for it is the Yang-
polarized mind that makes the
problems. Most especially it
disturbed the sage to see
meen dcserting the way most
natural to them. and thinking
they Will find real fulfillment
in the outside world He said
they are dooming themselves to
lives of empty soliseeking. The
solution to all problems of life
is not to be found in striving to
mold the world to your petty
desires, in complaints and pro-
grams, in perpetual discontent
and reformation, but in
adapting the self to what is.
If you are empty, your world
is empty. If you are filled, your
world is filled. But Without the
feminine dimension the world
is a sterile, ugly, unieeling, un-
regencrate place tit only for
toads and newts. The sage then
quoted from his one immortal
work of twenty-five hundred
years ago, the Tao Te Citing
the only previous time he was
moved to recorded speech:

Understand the masculine, but
follow the feminine,

And you will become the whole
world’s channel,

Eternal virtue will not depart
from you

And you will return to the state
of the infants

Knowing every assertion has
a contrary, the master trans
slated “Woman‘s Liberation: A
Declaration” out of the shrill
and febrile air of intellect into
the deep reverberaticns of the
heart. The following is the same
article rendered paragraph by
paragraph into its authentic
emotional correlatives.

1) An old Woman is being
born, who thinks herself new.
She is the chromevplated, can-
dy-striped, stream—lined, 1969
gen-you-wine Viragoi this old
new woman has given over
her time-honored place to

technology, and she has found
herself without 2i place at all.
She rejects what she mistakenly
understands as the “superior
attitude of men,” and thus
rejects the wonderful. my-
sterious ccmplementariness in
which man is the leader,
woman his helper, who by
putting hcrsclf second is out
first.

2) Having forsaken her place,
the new woman is so insecure
and confused that she must go
about crying and demanding
her equality. Can he who must
demand his equality ever be
equal? He who is equal dmsn’t
demand.

3) She is prccessed through an
educational regime which could
not be better designed to
cripple and dcmean her
ingrained capacities as wife and
mother and render her fit only
to intellectualize about the
“problems of women." Since
she receives the identical,
irrelevant mindstutiing as the
malc, all sensitivity to, and love
of the inherent differences of
mm: and woman are destroyed.

4)- Deeply infected with the
disease of the times, she puts
herself before all things. Self-
exploitation is her end. Neither
happiness, children nor husband
can come before herself and
her desires.

5) So intellectualized is she.
she has lost contact with her
body, her hands, the joy of
movement and making. Her
home has become meaningless
U: her.

6) She is becoming a fulle
blown shrewi

7) She is utterly alienated
from her own emotional life and
the emotional life of simple
humankind. Her children are
such blank enigmas to her that
caring for them, nurturing and
guiding them is without
meaning.

8) She is worthless as a
mother. if her husband will not
relieve her of her burden she
will crack.

98:10) A Victim cf sociclogical

theories
reduce

which attempt to

masculinity and
femininity to mere acquired
role-playing, she will raise
Children as confused and lost
as herself.

11) She is full of self-pity,
blaming the meaninglessness oi
her home life on commercial
advertising. Because she cannot
distinguish herself from the
stereotypic images of the mass
media, she looks for fulfillment
in the “important concerns of
society.”

12) She has never known what
it feels like [0 be a woman.
She will do all she can to
spread discontent and destroy
the home

13&14) She has lost the sense
of gracious living, of simple
leisure, of meaninglul triviality.
She Will sacrifice all to self-ad-
vancement and "serious" o:-
cupation. Having no inner
security, she must seek identity
in a social definition.

15&16) She puts money and
self-aggrandizement before his
tangible rewards.

17) unavoidably afflicted with
a body that gets pregnant, she
begrudges the time necessary
to bear a child She will Wait
out gtstation, drug herself
during delivery, and quickly
rush back to. her “serious" pure
suits. She will 53 her best to
obliterate from her mind that
she is a mother.

18) Because she has nothing
to give her Children, she wil-
lingly (and perhaps for the
best) consigns them to nursery
homes and the care of
“specialists," rationalizing the
matter with copious verbiage
from child psychology texts.

19) She will submit to nothing
undcr Heaven.

20) She has lost touch with
the intuitive sense of play in
courtship. For the ancients.
Eros \vas a god. For the new
woman he is an intellectual
puzzle.

213122) She will have her
sexual gratification when and
where and how she wills it, and
demands that science rescue
her flom the consequences.

23) She is so humourless and
inscsure she cannot laugh at
the absurdities of commer-
cialism and advertising. The
images of the media overpower
her shredded feminity.

but she's forgotten how. or has
never known. ‘

26&Z7) Having tried to cram
the world into pale and decep-
tive intellect, the beauty of play
and ritual is lost to her. She
is blind to the fact that in all
places and all times men have
loved and admired woman for
their physical beauty and
feminine charm. She would
strive to abrogate what Nature
has decreed.
