Quad Opens For . . .

By Suzie Gelber

The Quad opens its heart and its house to the men of
North campus, tomorrow night at 8 pm. Smith of the border,
ladies prepare to welcome all comers, including administra-
tive personnel and faculty advisors.

Guided by the expansive spirit of Tom Jones, Molly
Brown, and Irma la Douce, each floor of femmes introduces
itself to any and all suitors with a Broadwalk flourish. Wan-
dering males are both permitted and encouraged on this night
of nights, as the “fair ladies” ensnare their men. All’s fair in
love and war except practices forbidden under open house
regulations, enforced during the 8-10 pm. random visits and
the 10-12:30 p.m. lounge parties.

Each women’s residence plans a demonstration of its af-
fection for a men’s hall by means of lounge entertainment
and specially selected food. South campus social chairman,
Dottie Dosse, interrupted while mixing and matching dorms,
acknowledged the tradition of the all-Quad mixer. “A pro-
gram apart from open dorms, open house, is planned as a sort
of gay and informal mass social introduction,” noted Dottie.
All irresistible forces and immovable objects are advised to
don informal date apparel and a festive air. ,

Bafflebroads, acting as temporary social chairman, and
Dithyrambers helped plot the mob capers, mapping a course
of action from Park Street to French House to Mears and on
to the Ioggia etceteras.

Invoking the protection of Sadie Hawkins, girls turn the
tables and take the invitation initiative during this South
campus complement to men’s open house. However, all the
Quadrangels wish to announce and affirm their undying af-
fection for all North campus men, and they plan to prove
their love with all sanctioned forms of hospitality. MENi‘
CgME AND GET YOUR SOUTHERN COMFORT — ON THE
H USE!

Throwing Houseparll'es

Society has several excuses for hanging on to worn-
out tradition — among them sentiment and neglect. But
when sentiment becomes a hinderance, one hopes that
necessity and practicality will take over. Such it should
be in the case of campus house parties.

Every year the ivy-covered annals of Grinnell Col~
lege living are dusted off again and the houseparty
rears its faithful head. Each house on campus is allotted
a sum of money to carry out its social obligations; stu-
dent representatives are chosen within halls to spend
that money. It is traditionally assumed that a major
portion of the pocketbook must go for the semester hall-
fest which less than half the hall residents will attend
and toward which a much smaller percentage will con-
tribute any time or effort.

South Campus has recognized, to some extent, the

social stagnation that house party imposition brings
about. Last year the majority of women’s halls sched-
uled one such party, rather than the normal two, and
attempted to spend the money on more original and re-
.warding social events.
‘ But on North Campus, house councils begin each
year as they did the last — making plans for the {all
houseparty. It is time for campus social leaders on both
sides to re-evaluate the houseparty system in their
halls and to make active plans to take this festering
thorn of worthless activity from under the campus so-
cial skin,

When houseparties are planned each resident will
be represented in the expenditure column, but as many
as half the hall members will never benefit from this
expense by actually attending the event, Money allo-
cated to the balls is meant for each individual and all
efforts should be made to spend it as such. Although
each hall contains residents that would not attend any
event planned, there is a definite need for rte-evaluation
concerning how many are really interested in finding
dates to attend the two annual houseparties.

Even more frequent than the non~attender is the
hall member who sits back and waits for the social
chairmen to “throw the party.” He won’t lift a finger
throughout all the planning and decorating procedure,
yet once the crepe paper has sagged and the quad is
locked, his cries of complaint are loud. No handbook
states that the social chairmen are elected as sole party
givers. If this is the case in your hall, the best place
to throw your party would be right out the lounge win-
dow.

Grinnell’s limited physical environment has been
more than worn out during the decades of party plan-

ning on campus. and the modern social chairman is al-

Letters to the Editor
Kohlmah Views North Campus Altitude, Hall System

The 1964 encampment is now
over and I suppose much will
he wnuen about it by students
and faculty who attended,
However, as I understand it, its
main purpose was to serve as a
vehicle of communication be
tween students and faculty~ad-
ministration. Thus the impres-
slons that it made on students
who did not attend is of pri»
mary importance to its goal.
As such a student, I write this
letter.

It would seem that the major
issue is that ol the attitude on
North Campus, and what steps
should be taken to make the
climate more conducive to the
educational goals oi the college
community. It is argued that
the attitude on North Campus
is such that discussions of
rules, social life. and seiual
activities dominates or com-
pletely excludes discussions
that would lead to intellectual
challenges. This, I feel, is only
half true, and I would hope
that at the encampment this
was discovered. The chants
concerning the digestive habits
of Smith, Clark, or Langan, in

 

an attempt to start a Water
tlghl. is louder and travels much
Iurther than a discussion of
Shakespeare, Most of the fac-
ulty was aware of the water
fight, few were aware of the
dlscussion. This is not to say
that obsene chants can be ex
cllsed because inlellectual dis-
cussion occasionally does take
place, or that North Campus is
anywhere near its educational
value capacity. Rather that
both horseplay and academic
discusslon can, should, and do
exist side by side on North
Campus. However, not enough
of the latter does exist, and this
is caused mainly by a mis
directed attitude. An attitude
which generally runs along the
lines of once I czoss Eighth
Avenue i can forget about studr
les and blow steam via the low
and often Violent humor that
has become an obvious part of
North Campus.

The next step is what do we
do to change this attitude, so
as not necessarily to exclude
horseplay, but to place more
emphasis on an exchange of
ideas. 1, myself, at this time,

 

Fresh Look at Upperclassmen:
Finds Luck of Maturity There

Dear Editor:

As an incoming freshman, a
great disappointment has over-
come me. Where are the ma-
ture. responsible upperclass-
men? The college catalog lists
one of the major objectives of
the college as developing “cow
sciousness of social responsibil»
ity” and "service to his fellow-
men.” Is the preping program
man’s ,social responsibility?
Are beanies a service to his fel-
lowmen? Is the freshman show-
ing concern for his comrades
through dirty telephone greet-
ings? The answer is obvious.

This immaturity is found in
other aspects of upperclassmen
behavior. Take, for instance.
the library. And it seems some-

one is. piece by piece. Why
were the Innocent freshmen re
quired to sign pledge cards
whlle the Guilty upperclass~
men were not? Consider also
the true purpose of the library
and its actual role on campus
A library is a place to gain
knowledge, but Burling is a
place to gain something else.
15 “What are you doing to-
night, honey?" an academic
question.

By pointing out this imma-
turity. I hope the upperclass-
men will reconsider their atti-
tudes, and I call upon my own
class to lead them in estab-
lishing a new, mature conv
sciousness.

Sincerely
A sad freshman

 

ways tempted to look beyond the Iowa cornfields for
a new and better site, An off-campus houseparty can be

 

great fun, but wandering over the hills and rivers of
Iowa just for the sake of finding ah off—campus site
because “that’s what the guys want” is impractical. The
problems of transportation, decoration, women’s hours,
and food transfer are often neglected until the plans are
well under way and the party starts to fall apart before
it ever begins. What might have started out as a mar-
velous idea on paper, becomes nothing but frustrating
fact once the party day arrives.

Each semester the social activity calendar is over-
crowded with events. Yet four week-ends must be
set aside so that the houseparty schedule can run its
course. It would seem that houseparties wore out their
welcome on campus some time ago, and what exists
now is more an obligatory maintenance project rather
than a desired program. We would suggest that if
a houseparty can’t be run by a full-house for a full-

house that the deck be reshuffled and some new deals ‘

made.

“Am not about to propose an

answer. Because of this, my oh-
jections to what I consider an
extreme proposal may be weak~
ened.

l believe that the complete
revamping of the hall system
would be a mistake. First of all
as already established and Orv
ganlzed subgroups of North
Campus they could be em-
ployed as workable units in the
process of reorienting the gen-
eral North Campus attitude.
Here are already organized
house councils or larger groups
that the administration could
meet with. They further reprev
sent a vehicle for a unique so-
cial system that neither frater-
nities nor dormitories can
match. They are not so indo-
pendent of each other that
friendships and interchange of
ideas do not span their bound- ,
aries. On the other hand, they
are introverted enough so that
they can serve as the basis for
a social life. It should be 1‘?

-membered that South Campus

does not have to serve as a cen-
ter for social functions. A less
important attribute of the hall
system is the intramural pro‘
gram which is so important
to our Physical Education Pro-
gram. This of course is a minor
lssue, but Should not be over<
looked. We happen to have a
strong and Worthwhile athlelic
program which would be drasti-
cally changed by a switch to a
dormitory system.

There are of course many
weaknesses to the hall system.
Perhaps they have become ov-
erly introverted. The familian
ity one acquires after living
four years with the same group
may to a certain extent dp
tor the exchange of ideas. Tho
social llfe they promote may
cause unnecessary [rustrations
with some of its members.
Worst of all their introverted-
ness might very well breed this
anti-academic attitudes

None the less, the hall syo
tem is a unique situation which
Grinnell can and should be
proud of. Faced with the choice
between a well-run hall system
and a well-run dormitory sys-
tem, I would prefer the hall
system. Further. there is. of
course, no assurance that a
switch to a dormitory system
would actually solve any of the
North Campus problems. It is
easy to say that the dormitory
system on paper looks better
than the hall system as it is,
but don’t forget that on paper
the hall system looks pretty
good. Especially the fact that
it represents workable unit!
through change, if needed, can
be promoted.

Shades of Gray
Americana on Trial

By Carl Otis Gray

Two years ago New York
City's public schools w are
forced to remove all copies of
Huckleberry Finn from the
shelves of their libraries. This
year a Chicago television net-
work was banned from allowing
Amos ’n Andy reruns to be
broadcast. Oliver Twist, as
Well as The Merchant of Venice
have been closely scrutinized in
various cities long known as
hotbeds of liberalism. To add to
this list of hallmarks in Ameri-
can and English tradition that
have recently come under fire
— America’s Own jovial god-
dess of the culinary art —- Aunt
Jemima, has been placed on
trial — not for illicit kitchen
tete-a-tete with Uncle Ben —
but for virtual genocide.

Being a product of Western
civilization, and Freudian psy-
chology, I feel than this black—
baiting is sure to frustrate my
Oedipal fixationLThat Aunt Je-
mima is a stereotype is true,
but that she is an offensive
stereotype is heresy; regardless
of what the new Civil Rights
Bill says, I can’t bring myself
to think of Betty Crocker in
terms of "Mamas"

Now picture, if you can. that
rotund grandmotherly lady with
the coffee hue and the red and
yellow bandana in front of all
those nasties at the NAACP.
There she stands armed only
with two dozen of those succu-
lent mouthwatering buttermilk
pancakes smothered with blue-
berries and maple syrup; she
smiles demurely at her ac-
cusers revealing that special
ra‘y of sunshine that has sealed
millions of boxes of self»rising
floor, There, four bespeckled
middleagers ranging in color
from buttermilk brown to burnt
biscuit black, sit in judgment.

, Two reporters from The Pitts-
burgh Courier and three from
Ebony are covering the trial.
All nine of these men have de
aided to forego the SNCC rally
in Biloxi in order to give the

high priestess of the pancake
a fair trial—besides the climate
in Biloxi is is bit uncomfortable
this time of the century.

The moderator oi this inquiry
— an executive Vice President
in charge of interracial Affairs
for an all-white corporation —
rises and with impeccable Ed-
wardian accent (acquired at
Fisk University in Nashville)
reads the sentence:

”You, Aunt Jemima, are ac»
cused of perpetuating the stere-
otype and crimes against the
Negro People; you are accused
of waffle witchery, biscuit
butchery, and conspiracy with
Beulah, the ever happy maid,
for the eventual overthrow of
the New Negro Race.

There is a great hubbub
among the members of the Ne-
gro Nurenburg. “Tsk, tsk!
Shamel Shame." they hiss in
unison.

“Woman

how do you

Picture our heroine, her pan-
cakes wilting, the gleam gone
from her immaculate iridescent
ivory incisors. She rises from
her seat with the dignity of
Sheba before Solomon, walks
with the sultry sensuality of the
ebony empress of the Euphra-
tes, surveys the tribunal with
the cool collect‘ ity of a Con~
golese countess. And with the
good Gospel Book in one hand
and "The Cook’s Kitchen Kaf—
ka" in the other: she trumpets
in sweet Gabriel-like tones
“Aw, man. knock it OK"

The moderator s h o c k e d.
lapses into dialect for a few off-
color remarks, signals that she
be taken away while shouting:

“Wicked wench, that cock-
sure coon, impudent nigger—i"
and wonders to himself ”But
what will they say at B’nai
B’rith?"

His colleagues uninterested
in the whole proceedings, look
at him in utter contempt and
say.

”Shut up, man, and help us
finish these pancakes!"

Encampment Discussed Six Areas
0iGrinneli College Community

By Susan Taylor

The fifty five student leaders,
faculty members, and members
of the college administration
who participated in the Student
Leadership Encampment last
weekend did a lot of tough
thinking and encountered a lot
of ideas and obstacles
' It was more than a weekend
away from campus for brain-
storming, It was more than a
weekend away from campus
for these people who will be
working together all year to
get. to know each other.

It was 'a'weekend which was
filled with a large number of
hours of disciplined discussion,
creative thinking, and frank
meetings of minds in areas
which are of vital concern for
the Grinnell College commun-
ity.

A composite of what emerged
from the weekend can best be
described as an understood
concept of that community.

Such a concept emerged from
six discussion groups—each con-
centrating its efforts in a spe-
cific area, but from time to
time, by design and necessity.
venturing out of its narrow con-
fines into the general area of
the college taken as a whole en-
tity.

One discussion group consid-
ered the address “A Game of
Numbers Revisited” which Dru
Howard Bowen delivered to the
college before his resignation
as president last June. Starting
with the basic philosophies of
education or this speech, which
would provide for more inde-
pendent work, thus teaching the
student how to educate himself,

 

this particular discussion group
considered the relevance and
feasibility of a tutorial system
and more independent study at
Grinnell College,

Anonher group considered
Grinnell as a preparation for
graduate school and the busi-
ness Worldl They discussed
such things as the academic
community which places a pro-
fessional emphasis upon grad-
uate study and the Vocational
alternatives which Grinnel‘l
readily represents its students,
Concluding that the liberal arts
education is valuable in itself,
the group suggested that not
only theacademic, but the so-
cial atmosphere of Grinnell is
relevant to preparation for
whichever path may be followed
by a student after he receives
his diploma,

Student lrresponsibility was
the problem encountered by
another discussion group. Con-
sidering such specifics as the
library theft rate. quiet hours
problems, and illegal visits of
women to men’s rooms, this
group arrived at a prevalent
attitude (among students)—
lack of involvement in the com-
munity. The objectives of the
college were seen as being able
to give the best liberal arts edu»
cation possible, and secondar-
iiy, giving students as much
freedom as possible However,
the group emphasized that the
secondary objective must not
infringe upon the primary aca-
demic one.

Still another group considered
the attitude of the various ele<
ments of the community to-
ward rules, and came to an un-

derstanding of why the college
takes many of the stands that
are represented by the rules, It
sought to increase and improve
the avenues of communication
in order to erase some of the
prevalent misunderstandings
in this area.

Another group considered the
extra classroom activities of the
entire college year, and sug-
gested improvements which
would increase the benefit of
these events for the entire col~
lege community.

A sixth discussion group con-
sidered the role of Student Gov-
ernment within the whole frame-
work of the college. Seeing two
functions of student gov’t—to
handle those responsibilities
properly delegated to the stuu
dents, and to consult with the
officials of the college in mat<
ters which concern students—-
this discussion group deter
mined the present structure of
student government to be in-
adequate for these purposes.
It began to suggest means and
plans for revision of the struc-
iure. t

At present it is impossible to
predict how much effect on the
campus the weekend will have
had, it did have some effect
on fiftysfive people.

A report will be made within
a few weeks and various discus-
sions and committees have al«
ready begun to react to some of
the ideas and concepts which
resulted,

Y Cabinet Strives for New Image:
Program to Stress World Issues.

By Cynthia Brust

"A new look and a great
year ahead” are the key words
or the Grinneli College YWCA
this year, according to the
Qabinet members. Many plans
have been made and'much of
the Y’s program is already
underway.

The IBM-’65 Cabinet hopes to
change the image of the Y, al-
jhough the organization and
basic purposes remain the
name. They hope to shake loose
the idea that the Y represents
nnly teas, white candlelight

inners and selling food in the
. uad on Monday nights. The
. WCA is actually a movement
hctively concerned and in-
I\iolved with current issues con—
fronting the world and, in parti-

ular, the women of the world.

uch aspects of the YWCA pro-

ram as work, education, sex
and moral education, the social
group, civil rights and the role
of the church in any or all of
these, will be taken up.

The basic structure of the

ampus Y will remain almost
ﬁle same as in the past. Margie

ayeda, vice - president and
rogram committee chairman,
as been directing all program

lanning activities. E v e n t s
pcheduled include a reception
{or the LeMoyne exchange stu-

 

dents, a senior forum, a series
of programs in summer jobs,
and information concerning op-
portunities in the national Y or-
ganization.

Dodi Holcher Will be in charge
of the social committee which
will not only involve social func-
tions but aso social action pro-

Mrs. Raviiis New Hosiess In Mears~
Finds GrinneII ‘InIeIIecIuaIIy Exciting'

By Ann Showalter

“When I told my friends in
Chicago I was coming to Grin-
neli, they all told me I would
like it here,” states Mrs. Mar-
jorie , Ravltts, Meal‘s‘s new
hostess. “So far this prediction
has been quite accurate.”

“The students have been so
helpful and friendly in answer-
ing my questions. I ask a lot
of questions; I want to know

[Where things are, how things

are done, what courses Hie stu-
dents are taking.”

She finds the students “alert
and inquiring,” the academic
program “intellectually excit«
ing."

She also had praise for the
student government operation.
"It looked rather complicated
on paper, but it is running very
smoothly In the hall.”

Saga Food Service is another
operation she considers out»
standing.

Mrs. Ravit‘ts has been con-
nected with the University of
Chicago for the past 14 years.
She went there first as a grad-
uate student working under the
Committee on Human Develop-
ment. which spans three grad-
uate study divisions directly
concerned with human life:
biology, sociology, and psychol-
Ogy.

 

She was a head resident in a
women’s dormitory at Chicago
for 11 years and served as As-
sistant Director of Student Ac-
tivities and Director of Housing
for Women at different times.

She thinks Grinnell probably
has the same kind of academic
pressures as Chicago, but feels
“a serenity and a solidity” In
the atmosphere here. She hopes
and intends to audit some
courses in the future.

Mrs. Ravitts conceives of
learning as a lifelong process.
“I learn so much from and
with the students, sometimes I
think of myself as a senior col-
league."

She believes learning is a con-
tinual striving towards wisdom.
and that wisdom includes “the
integration of emotional and in»
teliectuai responses.” She ex-
plained, “So often we know
intellectually that a thing is
right or true, but we have dif-
ficulty in accepting it emotion-
ally. We move toward this goal
of integration as we learn from
our own experiences and from
the ideas and experiences of
those who have lived in the
past.”

Mrs. June A. Main, 43 hostess
for East and West Norris for
the last four years, is now host-
ess in Main Hall.

PPPE Announces
Book of the Month

The 480, a political novel
about the 1964 presidential cam-
paign. has been selected by the
Program in Practical Political
Education as the October-No»
vember Political Book-of-the-
Month.

The book's title refers to the
480 different classifications of
income, occupation, race, re-
ligion, class, etc,, into which
the American electorate has
been divided by a behavioral
science corporation, in order
that computers then can simu-
late and predict voter reaction
to any candidate or issue. The
novel tells how John Thatch,
a happily married, successful
engineer, is lifted from politi-
cal oblivion, packaged, pro»
cessed, and sold to the Repub-
lican National Convention as
the Party’s candidate against
President Johnson, by two he-
havorial scientists using the
new computerized politics.

Burdick, author of earlier
bestsellers The Ugly American
and Fail-Safe, sees these anony—
mous professionals — whom he
calls “the new underworld of
American politics”—as an oin-
inous threat to democracy in
the U 5., unless their actions
and activities are known and
understood by the public.

Ripon Begins Title Defense With
Air Victory Over Pioneers, 25-14

By Nick ~Nonas

Defending Midwest Confer-
ence football champion Ripon
launched an overpowering air
attack here Saturday to pin a
25-l4 defeat on the Grinnell
Pioneers in the opener of the
1964 grid season.

Jim Ca‘hoon. the lGO-pound
Redman quarterback. stepped
into the gargantuan shoes va«
cated by Little All-American
Jack Ankerson and ﬁred four
touchdown p a s s e s coverlng
seven, 13. 28, and 73 yards. For
the day Cahoon completed 14
of 22 aerials for 214 yards.

Grinnell hopes were high
early in the game as hard hitr
ting halfback Elston Bowers
shot through left tackle on the
third play from scrimmage lor
49 yards before being brought
down on the Ripon Z& The
short-lived threat was ended by

. an intercepted pass on the 22.

Ripon took over with Cahoon
at the helm and drove 78 yards
for the game’s first score. A
29-yard pass from Cahoon to

 

Andy Goletz put the ball on the

trated to the seven yard line
and appeared to be stopped by
a rugged Pioneer defensive
line. With fourth down and goal
to go. Cal-icon tossed a seven
yarder to halfback Dick Ben-
nett for the marker. The con-
version attempt was wide and
Ripon led 64) after 11 minutes
of play.

Late in the second quarter
Ripon returned a punt to its
own 45. After driving to the
Grinnell 42, Cahoon took to the
air hitting Goletz with a 34-yard
aerial to the Pioneer 8. How-
ever, the play was nullified by
a penalty bringing Ripon back
to the 47‘ Ca‘hoon then con-
nected with five of six tosses
hitting Doug Bradley in the end
zone from 13 yards out with 35
seconds remaining in the first
half, The Pioneers left the field
at halftime trailing 13-0.

Grinnell came to life early in
the third quarter as the Pio-
neers tallied their first touch-

down of the season with a EL
yard drive. A Ripon punt rolled
out of bounds on the Grinnel139,
Bowers went six yards over the
middle and two plays later
picked up the first down with a
(our yard carry to the midfield
stripe. Faced with a fourtih
down and seven situation on the
Ripon 47, quarterback Denny
Hansen sent Bowers around
right end to the 37 for the first
down, On the next play speedy
halfback John Shierholz skirted
around right end aided by full-
back Marty Ringo’s crushing
downfield block whidh found
the Ripon defender lying on his
back and Shierholz in the end
zone for the score, Dave Gau-
ger’s extra point attempt was
blocked as the Pioneers cut
Ripon’s lead to 13-6.

Toward the end of the quar-
ter Ripon drove from its own
42 to the Pioneer 28 with Ca-
hoon hitting on several short
passes. on the first play of the
fourth quarter Oahoon fired a

Still/iii

‘ By Dick Lovell
Despite the gay pageantry and exuberant support
which the Grinnell College community provided for
its football team last Saturday, the Pioneers lost 25-14
to a good, but certainly not unbeatable Ripon team; A
postmortem might be in the offing, but I’m sure that

‘ every “If they would only have . . .” and ”Why the

hell didn’t he . . .” possible has been dealt with in North
campus lounges, faculty homes, and the union, as well

» as in Mr, Bowers’ office. What could I add?

Among things which might cause Grinnell fans to
hope for better fortunes ahead were the fourth quarter

_ passing of “Bomber" Anderson many good ball carry-

ing efforts (especially by Elston Bowers) and unspec-
tacular, but solid line play by the likes of Denny Hoe
merin, Jeff Lewis, and Larry Miller. Miller was injured
and will be out a couple of weeks His loss will be felt
but good depth should ease the burden.

Coach Young has really had the rug pulled out
from under a potentially great cross country team with
several unexpected personnel losses. Look for the re-
turn of Paul Patterson plus a lot of grueling work to'
pay off later this season.

Congratulations to Coach Simone. Vince Anku.
and the rest of the soccer squad for its successful sea-
son‘s opener. Everyone should take the time to see our
soccer team in action —- it is a tremendous game and
our team has few peers among colleges this size,

Grinnell Harriers Defend Tille
In Les Duke Meel Saturday

Coach Dick Young’s Pioneers
will be hard pressed to retain
their championship at Grinnell
College's third annual Les Duke
Invitational c r o s 5 country
meet on Saturday, Oct, 3.

The meet will be run on the
College’s 3-mile course and will
begin at 1:25 p,rn. (CDT) on
Ward Field.

Other teams in the meet will
be Luther. Loras, Graceland,
and Central. All five clubs are
given a chance to capture the
title because of outstanding in-
dividuals or good team balance.

A year ago, Luther, Loras,
and Graceland came in second,
third. and fourth, respectively,
as Grinnell took the crown,
The Pioneers also won in 1962.

But injuries and other disap-
pointments that have continued
since the initial day of practice
have dimmed Grinnell hopes
of a third championship.

 

The meet is named after Les
Duke, is former Grinnell foote
ball, basketball, and track great
who later coached and taught
here. Duke is one of the coun-
try’s top track starters and an-
nually serves in that capacity
at the Drake Relays and Kan-
sas Relays. He’s also a former
commissioner of the Iowa Con-
ference.

to gamble. Watt pulled down an

Gridders Face Knox Salurday

By Kenton Clymer

The Pioneers, off to a shaky
start last Saturday against de-
fending champions Ripon, hope’
to get oil on the right loot this
Saturday, when they meet Knox
on Ward field.

On paper. the Pioneers have
the edge. They have more expe-
rience, and a larger squad.
Knox, coached by Al Partin, is
a young team. counting mainly
on the strength of tour sopho-
mores. All four were outstand»
ing last year as freshmen. ,

If they come through in the
clutch, the Siwash could be
tough. They are definitely
stronger than last year, and
their line averages 205 lbs. com-
pared to Grinnell's 199 lbs. Be-
SIdes a strong line, the Siwasll
have more depth in the back-
field than they had last year.

Despite th e improvement,
Knox suffers from a relatively
small team. There are only 25

 

members on the varsity squad.

Coach Edd Bowers of the
Pioneers thinks Knox may be
a dark horse this year, despite
their 1070 loss last .week w
Beloit. He plans to make a few
changes in the lineup, which
he hopes will strengthen the
Pioneers. Morgan Michel will
probably be in the lineup as on
iensive center. and Barry An.
derson will likely see more
action this game. ‘

Larry Miller will be out for
the Knox game, perhaps for
the following Week also. RF:
placing Miller at guard will be
either Rick Anderson or,Skip
Weyrauch.

Coach Bowers is cautiously
optimistic about the outcome.
He expects to see a strong pass-
ing attack from the Siwaslh, and
thinks that, in Order to Win. the
team must develop a stronger
mental attitude toward the
game. ,

Langham will be at fullback.
Alan Rossman will back them

up.
Bruce Kaufmann will. be in
customary spot in the nets.

That deplorable example of
misplaced educational values,
exhibitionism, over-recruiting
and Big IO-ism, (IM football)
is about to begin and most of
the teams’ masterminds are
molding their behemoths into
the proverbial well-oiled ma-
chines.

There will be some changes
in the format and the schedul-
ing procedures, but for the
most part it will be just good,
dirty run.

with so many question marks
to be filled by preps, prediC<
tions are senseless. Word has
it, however, that Smith is load-
ed. When I asked Jim Randall
for a statement, the cautious

’ pessimist admitted that, “We’re

great!" sounds as if they like
their trophy.

Possible contenders? Who
knows? Dibble and West could
surprise. The only sure bet is
the sportsmanship award which
will doubtless go to Clark

 

Team Trounces Northern Illinois

By Steve Casey

The Grinnell soccer team,
led by record-shattering Vincent
Anku, trounced Northern llli~
nois on Saturday oz. Anku
scored six goals and set up an-
other one as he broke the Grin-
nell record. for most goals

scored by oneplayer in a.

match.

The match started slowly
with both teams missing scor-
ing opportunities. Then with
two minutes left in the first
quarter, Anku got the ball and
left three men, including the
goalie, sprawling in his wake
as he scored into an open net,
Just before the quarter ended
Anku took a pass and scored

his second goall

Northern Illinois scored its
first goal in the second quarter
on a penalty kick, Later with
less than a minuteiin the half,
Ted Cole wove around the de-
fense and scored to give Grin-
nell a 3—1 half-time lead.

The third quarter found Anku
scoring two goals, one on a pen-
alty kick, and getting an assist
on a goal by Fred Miller.
Northern Illinois scored a goal
late in_ the period to bring the
score to 6-2.

Persistent Vincent Anku con-
tinued his rampage in the fourth
quarter with two more goals
and one, for the sake of variety,
he kicked in leftrfooted.
