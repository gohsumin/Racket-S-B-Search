Grinnell, Iowa, Friday, June 5, I964

No, 30

 

Grinneil College seniors were
told Thursday night that “those
arts and sciences which seemed
so impractical during the aca-
demic grind may finally be the
most practical of all your stud-
ies.”

The speaker was the Rev.
Theodore A. Gill, president of
San Francisco Theological
Seminary, who delivered a tra-
ditional baccalaureate sermon
before more than 1,000 seniors,
parents, alumni, and other
friends of the college, in Dar-
by Gymnasium,

The services were followed
by an out-of-doors reception
hosted by President and Mrs,
Howard R. Bowen on the col-
lege campus, V

“This means take seriously
everything you have learned,"
the speaker said. “Let it make
a difference in you, and that is
the way you let it make a dif-
ference in the world. The edu<
cated person is not one who
knows the different facts. The
truly educated person is the
one in whom a difference has

been made by whatever faCts
he has."

Special Degree
To Honor Bowen

Grlnnell College today con-
ferred an honorary degree on
its president, Howard R. Bowen.

Mr. Bowen, who will leave
Grinnell July 1 to become‘presl-
dent of the State University of
Iowa, was awarded the doctor
of letters degree.

Edwin S. Hewitt of Liberty-
ville, “L, a member of the
Grinnell class of 1929 and chair-
man of the Board of Trustees,
and Dean of the College James
H. Slauss participated in the
degree ceremony, which came
after Mr, Bowen himself had
conferred similar degrees on
five candidates.

The citation read in part:
"We need here no review of his
high accomplishment. We should
remember his belief that the
decisions which make an out-
standing college are essentially
acls of iailh." ‘

Mr. Bowen became the sev-
enth president of Grinnell July
I, 1955, and leaves the college
ml the ninth anniversary of his
coming. l-lis tenure in the Grin—
nell presidency has been
marked by substantial growth
and progress in virtually every
area of campus activity.

Senior Class Gift
Will Exceed'$1,200

Grinnell College seniors have
given more than $1,200 to the
college as a senior class gift,
and there is more to come.

Donald W. Lambie, assistant
to the president, said the class
gift has been earmarked to
support the college‘s coopera-
tive program with LeMoyne
College in Memphis, Tenn.

Commenting on the gift, Pres-
ident Howard R. Bowen said,
“We appreciate this gift be-
cause it represents a voluntary
effort on the part of those about
to become alumni to support
one of the vital and worthwhile
programs of the college. A col-
lege can grow only as it has the
loyal support of its alumni."

Grinnell College today hon-
ored 281 candidates for bach.
elor of arts degrees at tradi-
tional Commencement exer-i
ciscs in Darby Gym.

Eugene J., McNeely, presi-
dEnt of the American Tele‘
phone and Telegraph Company,
addressed the audience of near-
ly 2000 persons, challenging
the graduates to ”. l . . choose
a goal that will strain all your
ability.”

“You must have a draw if
your life is to be truly success
ful,” the speaker said, “but it
must be a dream, not a day-
dream, A dream focuses your
energy and your talent, a day-
dream is a Sieve that lets them
leak away,"

Describing a dream as noth-
ing-more than the setting of
definite personal goals, the
speaker said that, in the setting
of goals, it is important to aim
high.

“This is essential not only for
your personal development but
for the development of the
country."

President Bowen presided
over the ceremonies, assisted
byEdwin s. Hewitt of Liberty-
ville, Ill., chairman of the
Board of Trustees, and James
H, Stauss, dean of the 'College.

William T. McKibben, Bene-
dict professor of classical lan-
guages, served as marshal, as-
sisted by Judge Drlng D. Need-
ham of Des Moines, a member
of the 50-year honor class of
1914, who served as honorary
marshal. Elbert M. Smith, as-
sociate professor of French and
music, was at the console of the
organ.

Miscellany and Digression

President Howard R. Bowen
in an address in the fall of 1962
Much has received much at-
tention in the field of education
attacked the reliance of the
American educational system
on grades and test scores as the
standard for the judging of a
student’s ability or progress.
in a more recent talk this
spring Bowen expanded on this
thesis suggesting some innova-
tions which might be introduced
BI. Grlnuell to raise the level of
Grinnell education.

These suggestions included
such innovations as the revis-
ion of the course grading sys-
tem, replacing letter grades
with a three-level high pass,
pass, and failure grading sys-
tem. The letters grades would
be used in the evaluation of in-
dependent projects and compre-
hensives which would probably
include the junior liberal arts
examination. Independent work
and comprehensives would be
considered as one quarter of
the student's total work at
Gl'lllnell.

l have neither the intelli-
gence nor the educational ex-
perience to match Dr. Bowen.
However, I have for the last
four years been a full pracr
ticilig college student. While
this in no way establishes the
presence of a high level of in-
telllgence in the author, it does
indicate a basic cunning that is
required to perpetrate such a
longstanding fraud, More im»
portant, perhaps, this recent
experience as a student gives
me a perspective which an in-
telligent college administrator
cannot possibly hope to obtain.

From this perspective I must
take exception to several of Dr.
Bowen’s suggestions. While I
would agree that often too
much attention is given to
scores of nationwide, standard-
ized, objective examinations
such as the if), College Board,
and Graduate Record examina-
tions, the answer does not lie
in the total rejection of these
tests in favor of all-embracing
subjective essay examinations.
Tile standardized objective test
have many weaknesses. They
Often test the students’ knowl-
edge of isolated facts. Little if
anything can be determined
about how well the student can
evaluate and interpret facts or
evidence and place them with
in a meaningful context.

The Junior Liberal Arts test
and senior comprehensive usu-
ally utilize both objective and
subjective tests to determine
both the student's knowledge of
facts and his analytical and in:
terpretive ability. In theory,

such a combination should be
ideal.

 

However, the subjective por-
tions of the test usually can be
criticized for the failures that
are apparent in the objective
tests. There is no correlation
between the two sections of the
test. It is as if one were at-
tempting to deny the constant
interaction between objective
and subjective thought.

The most common reason for
this failure to allow the inter-
action of objective and subjec-
tive thought is that the essays
are too broad to permit
weighting of the comprehen-
sives and grading them by
strict letter grades would tend
to emphasize the results of
these unreliable and often unin-
formative tests. The validity of
the results of these tests is
questionable, and their value as
a step in the learning process
of a studen‘t has yet to be
proved.

I would suggest that the Jun-
ior Liberal Arts test be geared
more to an understanding of
the contemporary and how the
work of the various disciplines
interact and‘influence each oth-
er in the search for knowledge
to help light our progress to
the future. The interim session
would be devoted to a program
of independent study selected
by the student in a field outside
of his major study.

To further emphasize inde-
pendent study and at the same
time eliminate the weaknesses
inherent in attempting to de~
termine the competency of a
Student in a field of study
through several hours of testing
which seldom require or per-
mit a student to utilize the
tools of his discipline in the or-
ganization and presentation of
facts, concepts. and hypotheses,
I would replace senior Compre-
hensives with a required sen-
ior project to be done by each
student.

In his senior year the student
would select a topic for a pa
per. This paper Would be more
than a research paper. It
would also require by the stu»
dent an understanding of the
procedures basic to his discip-
line. To facilitate work on this
project the student would take
a reduced course load, perhaps
two courses in the semester or
semesters in which the projects
are being done.

This, rather than a reliance
on several hours of testing with
dubious validity would prove
more valuable to the student
in terms of co-ordinating the
knowledge he has gathered in
his major field. It would also
provide a more accurate and
reasonable standard by which
the student’s progress in his
major could be charted.

a series of articles written by

Vince Anku especially for lho
5&3.

Ghana is making a pheno-
menal progress in the field of
education which is considered
the major tool for eliminating
tyranny, slavery, and inequal-
ity. Last year the U. N, statiSr
tics showed that Ghana spends
a greater fraction of her reve-
nue on education than any
other country in the world.
This means a lot since Ghana
jis perhaps the wealthiest state
in Africa (excluding apartheid
South Africa). By 1970 Ghana
will be the first country in Af-
rica and one of the few in the
world to have entirely free ed-
ucation at all levels. It is only
for technical and secondary
school sectors of education in
Ghana that fees are charged.

Before 1951 opportunities for
basic education were restricted
to the urban minority but are
now rapidly expanding to all
parts of the country. In Ghana
the coastal South was far more
advanced than the inland
North. Virtually all the schools
were located in the South. By
1952, primary, secondary, and
university education was made
free for the poor northern
children while the southern
children still had to pay for
their education. This tremen-
.dous educational opportunity
makes it possible for all areas
now to participate freely in all
aspects of Ghanaian life. After
a few years of self govern-
ment, Ghana was rich enough
to institute universal compul-
sory free primary education.
In 1954 mass adult education
was started, aiming to teach

basic literacy and skills to thel
rural population and above all
to mobilize their energy for
rural self-help projects. This
program contributed greatly to-
wards the transformation of the
Ghanian countryside,

In secondary education, the
emphasis is placed on scienti-
fic and mathematical subjects
in pursuance of the Govern-
ment’s policy of producing as
fast as possible enough quali-
fied men for the scientific and
technological revolution. The
secondary school population
grew in ten years from 3500 to
19,000, and the rate of second-
ary school graduation ins
creased seven-fold since inde-
pendence in 1957. However, the
government is not satisfied with
this creditable accomplishment.
A few months ago an eighteen-
member commission was ap-
pointed to study pre-university
educationiit included one ex-
pert from the United States and
one from the Soviet Union—to
find means of improvement.

it is perhaps in the field of
university e d u c a t i o n that
Ghana's achievement is most
significant. After about a cen-
tury of colonial domination,
Ghana had only one university
in 1951 with 200 students. There
are at present about 13.000 stu-
dents in the three universities
of Ghana and about twenty jun-
ior colleges. In addition Ghana
has Over 3.000 students in the
Western countries. The East-
ern hemisphere has generous~
ly offered 3,000 scholarships to
Ghanian students to study
mainly medicine, agriculture,
and engineering.

Ghana's educational progress

On July 6th, 1964, the British
government will issue an official
declaration of independence for Ny-
asaland. With effect from that
date, the map name, Nyasaland.
will be erased, and the original
name, Malawi, will be printed in
its place.

On that day Malawi will occupy
her rightful place in the world com~
munity of nations. It will be a
day of rejoicing and prayer not
only among Africans but among
all freedom loving people who

‘value the dignity of man and the

right of a people to shape their
own destiny,

The war for political indepen-
dence has come to a close, but
the Malawians are not so naive
as to think all is over; they know
that there remains greater and
more formidable enemies; and
those enemies are illiteracy, pov-
erty, disease, and hunger. The
Malawiuns are. resolved to eradi-
cate all these verminous enemiesr
They know they will never fail;

 

African Country Gains
Freedom; Malawi Now

 

they are used to waging Wars
against enemies and they have al-
ways won their wars. So there is
no doubt they will win the
struggle against the vermlnous en»
emies. Unfortunately, they can’t do
all this alone, but with the help
of those nations which have more
or less conquered killers of man-
kind, lhe Malawians are very hope»
ful.

And so on that independence day,
wherever you may be, echo back
to the beating drums of Africa
celebrating the liberation of Mala—
wi from the chains of colonial rule.
To some people it will be a day
accompanied with grief when they
remember their brothers W110 shed
their blood in the struggle for
human freedom. We as Malawians
won't ask other nations to share
our inner grief; all we ask from
them on that day is to share with
us our joy, and further more we
will ask them to pray that those
people who have been chosen by
the people to lead Malawi will act

 

with wisdom and justice.

Anku Discusses Education
in last Article On Ghana

visitors to the country. A few
months ago. Dr. Malcolm Adis‘
eshiah, Deputy Director-Gen-
era] of UNESCO, spoke highly
of Ghana‘s educational pro-
gram. He remarked that “uni-
versal primary education, the
high level of secondary educa-
tion, and the rapid growth of
universities in Ghana are signs
of Ghana’s determination to be-
come one of the lnost advanced
countries in education in the
world.

“On the countryside, Ghana
is doing one of the most im-
portant works on African cul<
ture, history, drama, music,
and dancing." he added.

The avowed enemies of
Ghana brush aside all these
praiseworthy accomplishments
of Nkrumah and his people and
constantly, th ough falsely,
charge Nkrumah with absolute
dictatorship. Experience has
shown quite well that slavery
and absolute dictators cannot
flourish among educated men.
I believe that Ghanaians‘ have
a. bright future if they con-
tinue to follow their able and
extremely dedicated leader.
who is cautiously directing the
course of their history. This is
the leader some “astute" west-
ern observers call ”the black<
man's burden.” Yes, indeed,
but the lightest and most com«
fortable burden the black men
have ever borne.

in my concluding remarks, I
quote an excerpt from a Niger.
ian radio commentary on Janu-
ary 4, 1964. “The most impor-
tant point, however, is that,
whatever one thinks of Presi-
dent Nkrumah’s policy, few
will dispute the fact that it will
take Ghana a long time to get:
another Nkrumah. Both the
people of Ghana and Africa in
general will certainly need
Nkrumah for many rnorl
years.”

SCARLET AND ILACK

Retrospective/y Speaking"
'Iiose, Were The Days]!

By Susan Taylor

When we returned to the campus
in the fall there was a great hole
in the ground where the new union
was supposed to be under con-
llruction.

But small worries had to be re-
pressed in order to take care of
the needs of the ever»present fresh-
men, and after they got through
with registration, we began to set-
lle down to a fairly normal aca-
demic year.

Dr. Bowen introduced us to the
place of women in the world in
his convocation address; we were
made well aware of the new liquor-
by-the-room ordinance; and the
first weekend concert was a per-
formance by Lambert, Hendricks,
and Banan. Well received.

The new thing for the year
seemed to be the Seminar on Or-
der. It went on in a somewhat
orderly manner throughout the
year. See your own notes for its
content.

The first big social event was
Homecoming. We lost the football
game by one point, All of the
traditional festivities went on, i
guess. I don’t remember — i
went home for the four day week-
and.

An ex-President graced the
campus and put us in the national
magazines when he fell down the
steps at Grinnell House and was
initiated to West Norris I-lall. Ken
Richards never knew he would be-
come world famous when he won
that election last spring.

Truman made a little speech and
gave a big press conference. He
made an unmistakable but unde<
finable impression on the camp-
us. And soon the always - non -
partisan PPPE was announcing
that lke and Mamie would besour
guests in the Spring of ’65.

The new college chaplain, brought
a fresh personality to the campus
religious life and also brought well:
remembered sermons: “J a s u s
Loses,” "The Opiate of the Peo-
ple,” “Will Success Spoil Joe Col-
iege?" /

The C of HP and the Dean of
Men had their traditional run—ins
and agreed to limit the number
of ice boxes in the balls.

The fall semester was graced by
the WUS Carnival, Dance 1M5<
which were notable for their birth
day celebrations, the election of
senior class officers, the Sympo-
slum.

On the rainy Friday afternoon
of November 22, we stood by tele-
vision and radio in disbelief of the
news from Dallas. No matter what
our political bent, we grieved for
the assassinated President and We
lived with history. The flag at half
mast until Christmas vacation re-
minded us of our feeling of empti~
ness and our bewilderment at wha
we should do. ' \

But as the Government went on
-—if changed—so did the education-
lil process at Grinnell. We went
about the tests and papers and
daily classroom assignments dif-
ferent, fuller people.

Before Christmas Vacation, we
burned the midnight oil, dined at
‘fformal” dinners and danced and
listened to Satchmo and his trum-
pet.

IWhen we got back from vaca-
tion the new Union was more like

 

a giant concrete cave than the
hole in the ground which had
greeted us in September.

0n into finals and then the In-
terim. JLA —- a movie a day —
Stanley Hoffman, Rosenﬁeld Lec-
turer — sleeping — Norwood Rus—
sell Hanson, Kenneth Burke —
comps — beer —- etc. -« etc. —
etc.

And with registration and the
campus motor cycle club we roared
into the second semester. '

Women's Week, grades, concerts,
civil rights, performances, papers,
letters to the editor tests, coffee
hours, speeches, etc., this was the
second semester. This is any se-
mester.

What stands out? Comps?
They’re over. Politics? The worst
is yet to come. The class of ’64?
They are so much a part of the
campus that we must see it as a
whole. »

Seniors and other interested stu-
dents began early to frequent the
placement office. Just how many
have jobs for next year is any-
one’s guess, but we will all re-
member the conferences with
Zeke.

The Beatles had no less effect
on this campus than they did
across the nation, but there were
still some of us who could proudly
say that we did not watch them
on TV.

There was the interdisciplinary
Seminar on Mr. Magoo, the visit
of the Governors, Fetzer Sing—
but I guess We already had my
say on that.

“Tidings Brought to Mary,"
“Major Barbara," “The World of
Shalom Aleichem." And to end it
all the music department finally
did something light and enjoyable
—“Anything Goes." Will we ever
forget Reno Sweeny?

There was the Orchesis Show.
But the tradition was not followed
— Langan, for the most part.
showed up sober.

The Basketball team came
through with a 1240 record, even
if the last home games were dis-
couraging. Mifflin and S un d ell
were voted to the all conference
team.

The SGA Convention was dom—

lnated by 1”: and J’s. Elected

were Johnson, Edquist, Read,
Hartl—opps? Johnson, Read, Ed-
quist and Hartl. The new regime
took over from the old, and with
the change of personality went a
change in style.

The Mock Political Conventions
were PPPE’s biggest show in four
years. Characterized by all the fan-
fare and some of the worst copy
the S d: B has ever printed—Abe
campaigns were carried on for
months. Hatfield and McGee key-
noted. The GOP nominated Lodge-

 

Hatfield and the Demo ballot was
formed by JohnsonrHumphrey. The
Republicans triumphed in the all
campus vote.

President Bowen announced his
resignation -— or rather the news
leaked out—and we learned that he
will be in Iowa City next year.
There were a few damp eyes at
the convention the next morning.
We will miss the Bowens; the col-
lege is lucky to have had them
for 3 years. -

'Spring Riot and Spring Day
managed to occur in different
weeks. The weather for the riot
was wonderful—as were the legal
2:00 hours; but we can’t say so
much for Spring Day —with all
due apologies to the Social Co-
ordinator.

Then there were finals and
comps . . . and now its mostly
over. But the memories and the
friendships will last.

I guess it’s best to close a story
that really has no end with a
salute to the Class of ’64. You will
be remembered.

And the concrete and steel
framework which may someday be
the Grinnell Forum is assuming a
glass coverin . ~

A college spokesman said the
total science facilities will be
fully air-conditioned when the
project is completed. Space
Will be available for future
faculty increases in each de-
partment, and each faculty
