MacDowell

By Rick Schniernv

The lirst edition ol the rein<
carnated Interim session has
been termed a “success" by
Interim Coordinator Rick Mac-
Dowell. MacDowell, a junior,
said he felt the recent interim
session (January 9-H) was suc-
cessiul because it “was student
organized and student run.”

Previous Interim sessions de-
voted to independent student
activity have been coordinated
by the tacuity and adminis-
tration, The last oi these was
held in January, 1965. Lack of
student participation and inter-
est caused discontinuation or
the program.

The program was revived this
year on a voluntary basis under
student control and for a bl’leler
period of time—iive days in-
stead of two weeks. Students
headed by MacDowell handled
all the organizational work.
About 350 students returned ear-
1y lrom Christmas vacation to
participate in the Interim pro
gram.

The program centered around
the lorty student-led discussion
groups. The groups each dealt
with one Of the following six
topics: the God is Dead controa
versy; Population Problems;
William Faulkner; D. H, Law-
rence; Joseph Conrad; and John
Updike. Five to nine students
participated in each or the dis-
cussions.

to MacDDwell and some discus

expresed in a special Interim
evaluation poll was lovorable. or

worthwhile and effective, while
17 did not. 81 would not have

Some discussion groups aroused
such interest that they have
been continuing after Interim.

Other Interim activities includ—
ed coffee hour discussions, the
Roseniield lectures on world
population problems, and social
events.

The coffee hour discussmn on
premarital sex proved highly
popular with about 160 students
crowding into the South Lounge
to hear Mrs. Edith Ray, Iowa
State University; Mr. Ken Bar~
ringer, consultant tor Family-
Lile-Education of Iowa: and Mr.

Hauser Discusses Impending
World Overpopulalion Crisis

By Steve Montgomery

Rising population cannot be
ignored it we are to have a
realistic vision of our future en-
vironment, contended Rosen-
Tleld Lecturer Phillip M. Haus-
er, director ot the Population
Research and Training Center
at the University oi Chicago.

According to Dr. Hauser':
discussion of “World Popula<
tion: Trends and Implica-
tions." the ﬁrst in the three lec-
ture series delivered last week,
recent U.N. ﬁgures forecast a
world population of 7 billion in
the year 2000. and a density of
one person per square loot in
6000 years, it the current 2.1%
growth tale continues. In-
creased mortality and de-
creased natality remain the ob-
vious alternatives to the popu-
lation explosion.

Advances in hygiene and
medicine have slashed man’s
mortality rates. In the West
this “Demographic Revolu-
tion" has evolved over several
centuries, but due to man's Cul-
lure-transmitting capabilities,
more primitive areas can now
reap these benelits within a few
years. A ship anchored off Sai-
gon discharges the soap, enti-
biotics, pesticides, and fertillz<
er it took the rest or the world
centuries to develop.

Only under the pressure of
numbers have men focused
their ellorts on fertility control.
Tunisia, Egypt, South Korea.
India, and dominantly-Catholic
Chile have made decreased
natality national concerns. The
Kennedy and Johnson adminis-
trations have initiated a policy
aimed at decreasing the birth
rate to the theoretical optimum
of 2.27 children per couple.

Dr. Hauser noted that the
two major ideologies originally
opposed to birth control—Marx-
ism and Christianity — have
modified their stances. The So-
viet Union has found that over-
population is a brake on even
a healthy socialist economy and
has dropped her attacks on the
“Dismal Theorem” which con-

lends that population will al-
ways outrun tood supply.

Since the 1530's, Protestant:
have greatly revised their duo
trines on birth control, recogu
nizing that sex has implica-
tions beyond mere procreation.
Deliberations now in progress
in Roman Catholic councils in«
dicate their appreciation of the
limited workability of periodic
abstinence (rhythm method) in
combating the population
crisis.

Despite these ﬁrst hopeful
steps, major obstacles still
stymie effective solutions to
man’s lecundity. lnsullicient unA
derstanding of cultural change:
and social interactions and our
meager knowledge about effec-
tive contraception are impedi-
ments to progress that will re<

Deans' Vel'o Cri‘licized . . .

By Vetuing proposed open rooms during North Campus Week-
end, the Deans’ Committee has implied its negative position on
the visitation question. it: procedural objections to open rooms are
pragmailcally indefensible: mere prior notification is the only
preparation required [or such visitation.

The Committee‘s Contention that “the program for the week-
end as presented at the meeting did not require open rooms," is
capricious perversion oi the intention oi the handbook’s "appro-
priateness” Clause rather than a clarification of it. Students are not
arguing lbr the necessity oi open rooms this weekend; they are
arguing for an appropriateness which has been traditionally estab
lished. No social event is, strictly speaking, “required," yet any
event is the sum of its parts and open rooms are an integral part
or North Campus Weekend.

Dictatoriul prohibition of open rooms is, at the least, had psy-
chology and at worst, a violation or community integrity. Need
one one the’obvious example or Prohibition, its attendant abuses,
and eventual repeal? To deny the conventional request tor open
rooms, winch require a bare minimum or planning, on procedural
grounds is to disregard visitation's praisewprlhy aim or encourag-
ing informal socializing on a campus much in need of such oppor-
tunity.

The connotations of the Deans’ Committee decision are all too
clear. The Committee has played its hand # and its trump card
is a Club. If it is indeed the aim of the Committee to “keep the
issues honest" the committee must define rather than avoid the
issues. it it is the aim oi the Committee to avoid alienating Seg<
merits oi the college community (it this is a cummunily), it be-
hooves the Committee to judge the question of open rooms on this
occasion or any other occasion in an open minded manner and to
remain responsibly receptive to the opinion or the community it
seeks to serve. —S. G.

ln’rerim Lauded . . .

We praise the initative shown by students who setup and par-
ticipated in the interim Session.

Their efforts indicate that students can be highly motivated to
learn on an independent basis and Without the pressure at forced
academia.

Rick MacDowell, who supervised the planning of Interim, es<
pecialiy deserves congratulations. Undaunted by Administration
skepticism, he brought the initial plans to iruition.

The College shnuld iurther encourage (allow?) Students it) de—
velop initiative and sell~motivation in academic areas.

The external pressure of grades and requirements cease after
the college years; the desire [or education should not. —K. N.

New Editor . . .

The editorship of the 5&3 has been tossed around a bit since
leaving Hal Fuson‘s hands last semester. Suzanne Gelher was
elected editor for a full week until she made plans to enroll in an
oft-campus program. Now Suzanne is back with us as Associate
Editor (her course schedule would not permit a leave at this
time) and i ﬁnd myseli as 5&3 editor tor the next year.

The newspaper is in a stage or transition; a new stall is being
developed.

By soliciting stories lrom non-start students who are “special-
ists” in a particular held of interest, we Wish to broaden the per-
spective oi the paper. The end product may tend toward a journal
rather than a newspaper but such an orientation is probably more
beﬁtting a college weekly.

We think you will lind the new Grinnell weekly more pertinent,
more mature, more intellectual. We also hope to evolve to an
easierrto-read and visually pleasing lormat,

We subscribe to the in-depth, “news analysis” philosophy at
reporting and to the integrity or the student tree press,

A Student Opinion

Perspective

By Grant Crandall
Richard Schneirov

Aiter reading the statements attributed to
President Leggett in the editorial oi the Decem
her 2 issue oi the 5&1}, we tell it necessary to re-
ply. in a statement which we decided not to pub-
lish, we called President Leggett a hypocrite. Wo
telt that his statements on “in loco parentis", map
aliiy, community and student government contra-
dicted earlier statements he had made and state-
menls lound in the catalog. However, in order to
be fair to President Leggett, we decided to talk
to him betcre publishing the article. Aitcr on
intensive, two hour talk on December a, we lelt
that our original article was an incorrect analysis
of the situation. Because or this interview we now
tool that President Leggeit is not a hypocrite, is
not trying to deceive the students, but, on the
contrary, is conscientiously trying to fulfill his
duties as president of the college.

The question still remains, however, how
could Mr, Leggett publicly contradict himself
so unknowingly? The answer lies in his inabil-
ity to communicate erlectivcly with the Stu»
dent body. We left our talk with the reeling
that president Leggett had been using such
words as democracy, community Ind morality
very loosely and with meanings quite tiller-
ent train the meanings that many students give
to them. For example, to Leggett a community
is simply an aggregate pl individuals living
together. He completely ignores the modern
connotation of the term implying a mutual
respect and responsibility among equals. To
Mr. Leggett democracy seemingly has no po—
litical implications. The statement that Grin-
pell is democratic means to him that all stu.
dents are equal and may talir to the adminis.
trntlon about their problems at any time. This
retsricted dcliniticn allowed Leggett to say
that student government did not cxist ror any
“genuine political necessity" but only as an
“Arena for training."

Perhaps the most basic disagreement we have
with Mr. Leggelt is on the “in loco parentis” is.
sue. Mr. Leggett insists that the administration
“define the environment in which the students'
sellregulaung society is to operate." To us, how-
ever, it is obvious that whoever controls the one
vironment will also c o n t r o l the society. We
believe that while the administration can set

guidelines, it should do so only after consultation
and general agreement by the students.

This division on loco pai'entis" maniresis
itselr most openly in the pnemarital sex issue.
in our conversation Mr. Leggett reiterated
that “he did not have an open mind on this
issue." He stated that by this stand he was
saving the students involved tram hurting
themselves, their families and their lrlends. He
said he was looking out lor the wellare oi im-
mature students. We cannot agree with Mr.
Leggett's judgment on this matter. We reel
that Grinnell students are mature enough to
make moral decisions tor thcmsclves. Anyone
close to the students or Grinnell will recognize
that they are making these decisions and will

on leggett

continue to make them whcihcr the college
likes it or not.

College should be a place where students are
searching, questioning, and trying out new ideas.
We believe that education is precisely learning
how to live, and that o small, liberal arts college
such as Grinneli has a unique opportunity to ex~
perimcnt in new approaches to living. We can
only improve society by crcating a better one
vironment here in Grinnell than we have else
where. In reporting on the Encampment for tho
5&1} Kathy Jagow stated, “An initial goal of the
liberal arts college is to alienate the student in
some degree from his society, by pointing to the
myths of our culture and the inconsistencies or
our system of thought and behavior.” We don't
want an exact, miniature version of outside suciv
ciy with its hate, prejudice, and strile, We are
here at Grinneil in search lor an alternative. That
is why we disagree with Mr. Leggett when he
takes a rigid, rundcmentalist position on morality,
and when he says, "if students do not find this
environment to their taste, then the adjustment is
theirs, not tbe college’s.”

We reel that the college should have the ﬂex~
lbllity to change, Why do so many conscientious
and intelligent students choose a small college
over a large university? Isn’t one or the reasons
precisely because they think that the smallness
and closeness of the liberal arts community will
enable them to inﬂuence what goes on abou
them, while in a large university they would tee
lost and insignificant? This is why Leggett’s authe
oriiarian philosophy, which is only now being res
vealed, is so disillusicning.

Wc feel that the wide disparities that exist be-
tween the educational, social, and moral phil-
osophies or the. members or the Grinnell com.
munity must be discussed, debated, and re-
conciled anew. The issue or morality is one
about which there is great need lop better com-
munication and understanding between the

nunger generation and the older generation.
ilorallty, including more than sex, can no long.
er be dictated by the administration of a coir
iege (it may be dictated hut intelligent student!
just won't blindly roliow it). it must be and
is decided by each person individually.

it the members at tht administration and the
lnculty wish to aid the students “in a lifelong
quest tor a considered sense of values" (according
to the catalog), they must not limit their help to
merely dictating behavior by rules because this

authoritarian approach will generally be unsuc-
cesslul in dealing with the intelligent, question.
ing students ot crinpell. They must advise the
students, not dogmatically lay down rules. The
College may successtully enforce its rules on
morality, prevent student misconduct and avoid
public censure, but it will not have persuaded the
student to incorporate its moral values as his
own.

it was with the hope that we plight improve
communication among the students, faculty and
administration that we wrote this article. In view
or this aim we recommend that discussion groups
and seminars of students, taculiy, and adminis-
tration on campus morality be established.

Student Leaders Write Johnson;
Voice Doubts About War Ettorts

S.GrA. President, Steve Kent,
was one of 100 college and uni-
versity s t u d e n t leaders last
month who signed u letter ex-
pressing concern to President
Johnson about the war in Viet-
nam. The letter, which devel-
oped trout discussions at last

summer’s meeting or the Na-
tional Student Association, ques-
tioned certain U.S, policies and
appealed for freer discussion
and clearer governmental ex-
planatiun.

The leaders called for an ex-
tension of the holiday truce in
Vietnam. They expmsed in-
creasing disturbance about the
discrepancy between their per-
sonal convictions and their mil<
itary obligations, ‘as well as
About the war itself. They criti-
clzed the draft law, citing the
“a l m ost universal conviction
that the present Selective Serv-
ice law operates unfairly."

The letter questioned the need
of a “growing commitment" to
protect America's “vital inter-
esls” in Vietnam and the use
or the military to create a
“stable and prosperous Viet-
nam." The student leaders
voiced doubts about U.S. willinga
ness to allow the Viet Cong iull
and independent participation in
negotiations.

The students were concerned
about whether the U.S. would

Senate Hears Dean on Drugs. Draft

Wednesday night Dean
Thompson spoke to the Senate
on drugs and the dish. Thompa
son had recently attended two
canierences on the problems.
The draft conlerenoe. held at An-
tioch, was an “uncomfortable"
experience. he said, because of
the reluctance oi the partici-
pants to discuss the Selective
Service Act itseli rather than
other is S u e 5 like Vietnam.
Whether student protests re-
garding the dratt would have
any eilect on the law, he said,
is questionable, The not expire:
this June, but he doubted any
"revolutionary" new law will
be adopted,

0n drugs, he said, any com—
ment is dllllcult because the
subject is loaded with common
misconceptions and prejudiced
terms. The effects ot drugs, he
said, were Variable and little
known. Doctors know there are
risks in taking drugs, but what
the risks are tor dinerent people
is still unclear. He said it was
more uselul to talk of drug
abuse and habituation rather
than addiction, and disagreed
with the sensational articles on
drugs in Lite. The drug cona
ierence he termed “the most
useful" and said the policy
statement on drugs issued last
spring by the administration

would be slightly modiﬁed He
did not elaborate.

fact that Thursday’s request for
open rooms involved a last
minute change from Friday to
saturday night. Asked to pre-
dict the future of Visitation in

tlon‘t know; it depends on ev-
eryone.“

Bob Foote, C of HF president,
commented after the Thursday
Deans’ Committee meeting that
open rooms during North Cam-
Ius Weekend were a tradition
at so) years standing. Open
rooms were scheduled last; year
on North Campus during the
same weekend. “The focal
point or today’s committee
meeting,” stated Foote, “was a
heated discussmn of what is an
appropriate social event during
which to schedule open rooms."

While admitting that “it is the
prerogative of the deans to se
lect occasions for open rooms,"
new Social Coordinator Steve
keich maintained that he had
presented the Committee “a
more adequate justification" of
the appropriateness of includ-
ing open rooms from am pm.

Statement

Committee, in consultation
with the North and South
Campus social chairmen, may

open house. or a general col-
lege open house, before all

The North Campus social
Chairman talked with the Dean
of Men late in the first semes»
ter. when details of this week-
more North Campus Weekend,
including a suggested time for
“open rooms" different than the
time now proposed, were not yet
firmly established. After a
Thursday noon meeting with
the SGA Executive Cabinet, tlle
North Campus social chairman,
and the acting Social Coordina»
tor, the Deans’ Committee feels
that the program for the week-
end as presented at the meet<
ing did not require “open
rooms” for the success of the
events as planned.

As stated in the Student Ac-
tivities Calendar tor January.
in spite of the title of “North
Campus Weekend,” the only
residence hall social function
planned is a folk Concert in
Younkei— Lounge and a dance in
the Norris Lounges (reference
is made to the last approved all-
campus open house, the South
Campus program of last Sep-
tember M, in which each wom-
en’s residence hall had planned
parties or programs that quite
successfully involved all resi—
dents and their guests). (It is
hoped that before we Compli-

Saturday in the weekend’s ao-
tivities. Reich asserted, “I’m
not convinced that the deans
are really concerned with the
issue of the ‘apprupriateness’ oi!
open rooms during this par-
ticular event.” Reich felt that
the committee was primarily
concerned during the meeting
with the general college policy
on visitation.

“The purpose of this Week-
end, rather than its events, is
unique,” explained Reich,
“and open rooms are the tra-
ditionai element which en«
hances the aim of the week-
end — to promote and en.

argued that the weekend is

stresses the development of
North campus as a social
entity, encouraging students
to “participate individually in
a social event approximating
a more natural existence than
is usually found at: Grinnell."
Agreeing with Bob Foote. who
commented that “the commit-
tee's objections were procedur-
al and political, rather than
practical,” Reich added that
holding open rooms Saturday

cipants. including faculty and
administrators as well as stu-

dents view the Interim idea
as a potentially effective way
of encouraging students to take
more initiative and get more in-
volved in learning.

The failure of the old interim
program caused many students,
faculty and administrators to be
skeptical of the Wisdom of the
new program when it first
came before the Senate last Fall.

The old interim program, in-
stituted in 1963, required all
students to be on campus. Con-
sequenlly. many students were
not specifically interested in the
planned activities. Furthermore,
the program consisted primarily
of faculty lectures. Student in-
volvement was by all measures
low.

in a poll taken for the 5&3 in

February, 1965, 3 s o sludents
agreed with the faculty decision
to drop interim from the sched-
ule and 275 were opposed.

Efforts were made this year
to assure that only those genu~
inely interested in the program
would return. The new program
placed emphasis on student in-
volvement in discussion rather
than lectures. This year’s poll
indicated that of those replying,
98 percent thought they benefited
from this participation. The 1965
figure tor a similar question
was 60 percent.

When asked about future plans,
MacDowell said, “I do not see
any reason why we should not
have an interim next year.”
Needed improvements according
to him would probably Call for
more coffee hour discussions,

needed including a better se-
lection of movies.

“in the long run, general ed-
ucation may he the requisite for
controlled fertility," Concluded
Dr. Hauser. “There is not one
example of a nation steeped in
illiteracy and poverty that has
decreased its birth rate; nor is
there a nation that did not lie
crease its rate with the attain-
ment of literacy.”

in his second lecture, "Popa
lilation, Economic Develop-
ment and World Politics,” Dr.
Hauser considered obstructions
to technological advancement in
areas where the number of in-
habitants as much as doubled
every twenty years. Such a
growth rate produces an “ad-
verse” age structure; a situa-
tion in which a large segment
of the population is too young to
work. Thus scarce funds must
be channeled into feeding and
caring for nonproductlve chil-
dren, a situation referred to as
“a disproportionate use of sav-
ings tor social investment.”

down a human drain, even by
the most optimistic of predic-
tions it will be nearly impos-

standard of living until the end
of the century.

Dr. Hauser contended that
population density is so well
correlated with attitudes to so-

ciety that a senator‘s vote in
Congress could be predicted bet:

with knowledge of his party.

One thing seems clear about

later."

“Is the music around Deep

“No. Actually, there’s less

Southeast Bottoms Project

Biscussed a

By BONNIE TINKER

At a conierence last Saturday
students from six lowa colleges
discussed the philosophy and
operation at a new project in
Des Moines.

"The Southeast Bottoms Pro<
ject,” unrelated to “The Des
Moines Project” or S.D.S., origi-
nated last summer. Jim Dunn,
a former social worker at the
Wiiltie House in Des Mnines, orr
ganized the summer staff oi nine
who began preliminary block
organizing.

The most tangible results of
last summer’s work were sev-
eral “demonstrations." Granted,
the neighborhood still doesn't
have a stop light, and it doesn’t
have sewers, but something
much more significant was at
complished. Gradually some or
the people in the Bottoms be-
gan to believe that change was
possible, and that they could
help to bring it.

Although most at the stall
left at the end of the summer,
the Project continued. This tall
it rented a house which the
people iixed up as their “Project
House.“ They use it tor regular
meetings or the neighborhood,
[or social acti ‘ties, and for a
weekly medical and psychiatric
clinic started by doctors irom
the College ot Osteopathic Media
cine and Surgery. A donated
mimeograph is used to put out
a neighborhood n e w s p a p e r,
“ACT.”

The community, of course, is
not yet “organized” but the
spirit of unity and optimism
continues to grow These people
are no longer talking about sim-
ply “improving" their neighbor-
hood — they are no longer going
to be satisﬁed with the paving
around the public water trough

—they are talking about end~
lug slums; and they re doing
something about it

There are several immediate
needs at the neighborhood if it
is to develop One is a com-
munity co- operative and credit
union The people are consist-
ently overcharged by local mer-
chants, on whose credit they de»
pend since they are unable to
get loans trom banks and loan
companies.

Another important project is to
get the area rezoned in the
city’s current urban renewal
plan the Bottoms area is zoned
industrial, although there is no
indication industry would use
the area.

A hasic premise oi the End
the Slums Movement and OI
the War on Poverty is that
change must come about pri—
marily through indigenous eta
torts. People from outside the
community may contribute re-
sources not inund wllhin the

t Conference

community, but the real leader-
ship and direction must be (lit:-
tated by the neighborhood. in
this context, the conference also
discussed possible involvement
of students in this and similar
projects. it seems that college
stuuems may tunction in two
hasic ways: they could go to
Des Moines on weekends to
work, and they could raise mon-
ey to help iinance the Projectt

Student volunteer work is like
ly to be unreliable, and most of
it could be done by neighbor-
hood volunteers or start anyway.
Financial help is likely to be
much more helpful to the com-
munity. Funds could be used,
for instance, to hire people irom
the neighborhood as stait men‘r
hers.

Helping to ﬁnance a project
is not as exciting as running
your own crusade, nor is it. as
righteonsly grimy as a worlt
camp, but in the long run it
may be the most significant
contribution affluent societies
can make to developing areas.

There Will be a meeting in
the South Lounge, Monday at
7:00, to discuss the “Southeast
Bottoms Project” and possible

Grinneil involvement.

‘3 Gropplers Will Fate Conference Foes Grinnell Tankers

Cagers in Conference Cellar;
Face Tough Foes This Weekend

The Pioneer basketball team
dropped their sixteenth and sev-
enteenth consecutive games last
Weekend and will face two rough
teams this weekend as they at-
tempt to get out oi the con-
Iei‘ence cellar.

The seventeen losses included
two in the Colorado Christmas
tournament and two conference
losses during Christmas break.
A: Colorado the Pioneers lost
to Knox 82-53 and Chicago 52-42,
in the two conierence games
they lost to Knox again 33768
and to Monmouth 6654.

Last weekend the Pioneers
dropped their toutth and titth
conference games to Ripon 92—
85 and to 'Lawrence 73-7Zr

The Pioneers were hurt by
cold shooting and inconsistent
rebounding over the (our games

at Christmas break. In the {our
games they could hit only as per
cent and were beaten badly on
the boards, Coach Pfitsch has
said that the Pioneers had to
hit around 45 per cent to win.
Pfitsch, though, was a little
happier about the games the
team played at Monmouth and
Knox and was hoping to pick up
a couple of victories during the
current live game homestand.
Unfortunately the easier part
of the homestand is over and

“What do you thing are the
reasons tor the relatively sud-
den interest in traditional
folk music?"

“l’ve had that question
asked to me, i guess at least

two hundred times in the past
three years. and I've answered
it in every kind of way but the
right way — i honestly don’t
know. I like old time country
music because to me it’s a part
of the people who, so to speak,
carved the country out of a wil-
derness. . . . Everything they
had, they made by hand . . .
so the music was sort of hand
made. too — just like antique
furniture or an antique car —
you like it because it sorta' has
a personality — or a lot of per-
sonalities put together, . t .
I'd say maybe that the city
folks , . t have the same feel-
ing about the music it gets to
them — maybe they don't quite
understand why."

“What, in your opinion, is
the future of oral tradition
under contemporary commer-
cial influence?"

“Well, that’s hard to say,
because, for instance, the re-

vival of old time country mu-
sic wasn't until the Kingstons,

. . It was brought to mind,
so to speak, by a commercial
group. r r . Then when the
Friends or Old'Time Music, in
New York, started their little
movement . . it caught on . . .
Since it is sort oi like antique
iumiture, maybe the commere
cial aspect or folk music won't
have much effect on it one way
or the other, maybe it’ll just
hang on for a while I hope it
does.”

Will Host Relays

Grini'iell College’s swimmers
swing back into action today af<
ter a sot-week break in their
schedule

The Pioneers, who haven't had
a meet since dropping a 5861
decision to Midwest Conference
Champion Cornell Dec. 9, will
host Luther, State College of
Iowa, and Wayne State (Nebras-
ka) in the first Grinnell Relays.

Diving preliminaries are
slated for 2:30 p.m. with the
swimming competition and div-
ing hnais beginning at 4:00 pm.

Only relays competition is
Slated, There Will be eight Var-
sity and two freshman relays
along with 2 tworman diving
competition on the varsity level.

In addition to a championship
trophy which goes to the winning
team, medals will be presented
to the members of each first
place relay unit.

Wayne State ranks as a
heavy favorite to carry away
the trophy. The Nebraska out-
fit, which boasts 10 letterman
plus several talented newcomers
defeated both Grinnell and Luth-
er in a triangular a year ago.

Aided by two weeks of heavy
practice, the P i u n e e r s are
rounding into top notch physical
shape, according to Coach Ray
Obermiller. But, he fears his
team‘s lack of depth, always a
p r o b 1 e m . will be especially
troublesome this week.
