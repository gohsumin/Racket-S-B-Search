The Oxford lilisis

lime. . .

You can’t learn much about the problem of integra
tion rs. segregation by talking to people from Dubuque
and Minneapolis.

That's why I went Monday to the campus of the
University of Mississippi. There I was successful ill ob-
taining some Natchez-Hulltsvllle-B’lobile viewpoints. Here
is something of what I learned about the Mississippi cri s
and the general Southern attitude toward the question of
equality of races ill education:

THE GENERAL attitude of the students and faculty
is one of embarassment over the violence alld a feeling of
resentment of Northern interference into “our problem."
Any other attempts to describe tlle attitude of the Oxford
campus community need to be prefaced witll “some stu-
dents,” or ”some faculty.”

Some students I tallied with were obviously pro-segu
legationist and were proud of Others were largely inv
different expressing only conrern at the interruption of
their studies and social life.

ANY I’RO-INTEGRATIONIS’I‘ views were kept well
hidden. Mississipppi is not the kind of school you go to
if you are all ardent pro-l'lltegrationist.

I asked the editor of the Daily Mississipian wllat edir
torial stand she was taking ill regard to the whole situa-
tion. She said she is ill 'lng students to eschew Violence. I
(rueried her on her personal stand on integration and she
declined to answer.

The phenomena. most difficult for me to under-
stand and, I suppose. for most other Northern stu<
dents, is the apparent ease and nonchalance with
which many Southerners rationalize seeing-alien. It’s
as if there never really were any question about it:
“Meredith is a Negro and he’s entitled to his educa-
tion but I’d just as soon he got it elsewhere.” That‘s
the quite mattel f-fact thing you'd hear from many
honest and stir ghtvtllinking Southerners.

Integration will come to Missi sippi because it is the
law of the land. It will havehard traveling because, un-
fortunately, laws often don’t respect local attitudes.

In all respects, the best thing we at Grinnell can do
is try to understand — and wait.

. . . leadership

One person can be held largely responsible for the
\‘iolellce at Oxford: Gov. loss Barnett. V

He could himself have carried out the Federal Court
ruling that Negro James Meredith be enrolled at Ole
Miss, Had he dolle this—perhaps appealing the decision if
Ile felt so inclined—but, ill al case, seeing that the ruling
was carried out peaceably, there would have been no need
for US. marshals or troops.

Barnett could have handled possible agitation
arising from Meredith‘s enrolling with state troop-
ers—but he didn’t. Instead, in an obviously politically
motivated move, he stood against the ruling thus r-
ing local and regional racist blood.

What was done by the Federal Government had to
he done. The Justice Department acted with great consid-
eration and discretion. Call it Northern interference or
whatever, the move was necessary because integration will
not come of itself ill Mississippi — not as long as there

are leaders like Barnett.

'l-lei‘ﬁe/o’ scandal sheet' [lit

To the Editor:

We think that the changes

be at all cu'ccuvc, n radical

sccms obvious to us that a large
portion, if not the majority. of
the students are immature both
personally and in inter-student
relations, and are unable, or at
least unwilling. to lake theme

Thc recent outbreak of prep-

and innumerable other ridicw
Ions stunts and attitudes.

Thc childish attitudes of the
students are indeed appalling,
But we feel that ncl only are
these attitudes not being dis»
couraged by the administration,
but are fostered by the petty
regulations that are imposed in
some instances and the excessive
hands—pa policy in clhers.

The administration is neces
sarily a guiding hand to student
government. But the emphasis
is tragically misplaced. we are
told, for example, that as col<
legs students we are mature in-
dividuals, but are at the same
time required to have our doors
open during open~open dorms.
Can the administration expect us
to act like adults if we are cone
stantly being told that we are
naughty children who are 1an
able to look nflcr ourselves?

0n north campus it is pos-
sible to ﬂagrantly break rules
with very little concrete action
by the administration. Such
incidents in past years as the
Terry Bisson aﬁair and the
1960 Boar‘s Head dinner, and
this year, last week’s prepping
stunts demonstrate the wny in
which oiienders get oﬁ very
lightly at the hands 0! other
students.

South campus, on the other
hand, is subiected to ridiculous
rules which require girls to be
dcpcnclcnt and unimaginative. It
is aSsleed that the girls are too
immature to decide (or them-
sclvcs when to come in at night,
Wilh no locks on the doors,
there is little chance for real
privacy. It is not uncommon to
have one's private aﬁall‘s and
habits challenged by the Dean
of Women, Women can literally
be held priscncr for infractions
of rules.

The existence of freshman
dorms and discouragement of
oil-campus housing also discouiu
age initiative. Most of the dorms.
particularly the freshman dorms
offer a very poor atmosphere
for serious intellectual endeavo s.

To the Editor:

It is a well cslablishccl tact.
that, due in publishing problems,
the newsprint used by the s &B
is of inferior qualily and yel-
lows quickly with age. There
certainly seems to be little need
to aggravate this condition with
bad editorial policy. Granted a
newspaper is obligated to take
a stand on Certain controversial
issues. The type of intense per-
sollal campaign witnessed in last
week's critique on prcppmg is
much more than taking a stand.

1 AM sun that Mr. Hatﬁeld
derives great personal satlstacV
tlou in carrying on his private
crusade, but what about his reA
sponslblllty to the college and
his tellow suidenlsi Not that
we are not all guilty of this air
fense. Too many Grinnellians are
willing to shrug it on. falling to
present their views in lieu of
academic pressure or general
complacency. Be that as it may,
it would seem that a newspaper
ought to present both sides amt
if it chooses to approach an is-
sue lrom only one slandpoint.
as is so often the case with our
5&3, the least it can do is to
present its case in a scrupulous
manner. The gross misrepresen-
tatlon apparent in last week’s
issue is appalling.

We must remember that this
is THE GRINNELL COLLEGE
SCARLET AND BLACK, not
Jim Hatﬁeld's scandal sheet. Ad-
ditional criticism would have
litile effect other than to antag-
onize our editor further, and
who knows what lhnl would
initiate.

For the beneﬁt‘ of the some
2,000 parents, faculty. alumni
and iricnds oi the college who
read the 5&3 each week, l
would like to give a factual re‘
pcrl concerning the prepping is-
sue. To someone outside lhe col-
lege it certainly must seem that
the majority of our editors is
is against prepping. This is a
far cry from the truth. While
the maiorily of our editors are
not in favor of prepping, it is
a fact that each prepping “stunt"
is discussed at house meetings
or in house council and voted
on.

lN EACH case a majority is
required for passage, which
means that a majority or the
Grinnell students are in favor
of the events or the past few
weeks, After reading Mr. Hat-
ﬁeld's details of the Ncrlhclcrk
prep exchange one is led to be
lieve that it was a malicious
stunt that intimidated the {resin
men,

in truth. though the stunt was
proposed by upperclassmen, the
freshmen were consulted and
given a chance to withdraw, It
wasa freshman activity in which
only freshmen participated.

Let it be known that there
are many pl us involved in this
academic rat race who are not
against prepping, but are whole-
heartedly in lavor. Prepping pro—
vides an emotional and physical
outlet that is sorely lacking on
this campus, Perhaps it is best
summed up by a freshman who
said. “I ﬁnd pl‘epping‘ a genuine
beneﬁt in bolb the upperclass—
men and the freshmen. Prep-
ping offer us (freshmenl one of
the few opportunities to escape
the facade of this intellectual
community and get in know
our fellows as people: besides.
it is a heck pl a lot of just
plain fun."

ll eventually all such things
as prepping and the hall system
are done away whh and Grim
ncll becomes the type of sterile
academic community proposed
by some. wiLl this bc the kind
or institution where you would
send your children or that you
would want to help ﬁnancially?

You be the judge!

One at the greatest unsolved

John 'Burma (sociology), is co—

that she is being exploited,

Sociologists and psychom—
gists have reached it new un-
derstanding of prejudice and
discrimination It does not
Stem from any single cause,
but most of it can be traced
to one of three miljor Sources,
said Burma.

The first is that it mcets per—
sonality needs such as frustra—
tion and ego-building. Another
is that it can be employed in
“political and economic attempts
to get what one wants." To ap—
pear rational, one voices “plaus-
lble" reasons for Dnc’s prejudice,
The third source is the gradual»
ly built up hatred which has
been transmitted by process of
assimilation.

Three stages mark the change
in Negroswhlte relations. in the
"accommodation" stage, Negroes
sought concessions irom the
whites. We are now in the ”mile

legal equality, White good will
is no longer the only means.

When they achieve full legal

Christiansen stated that his

primary connection with Grin—
nell while he was in France was
through the Scarlet and Black,
“The 5&3 revealed a frivolous
life at Crinnell compared with
the all work and no play atmos~
pheres at French universities,”
he remarked.

The schools in France make
great demands on the students
and have very high require
nients. Not only do the students
work hard. but they are also
active in politics.

Christiansen concluded that
most of France’s resentment to-

to accept her role as a second.

will be considered by the col—

COST OF the two—level struc—
ture is tentatively estimated at

determined, construction is ex-
pected to require about 15
months.

The present Student Union

site has been selected as the lo.
cation for the new building, and
plans are. underway to remodel
the “Little Theater"

social center. The remodeled
space will later be used for so-

When asked for her impres—
sions oi the United states,
Einy mentioned that New York
was a “cosmopolitan city but
not good for living in," that
winter will be “shocking” since
she has never seen snow. and
that many things in the news—
