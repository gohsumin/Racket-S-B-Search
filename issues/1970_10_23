MANY EMPTY SEATS in ARH Auditorium provide mute testimony to the sharply declin-

feature a vote on a four-credit Humanities requirement and/or on the Jones Proposal for
a Freshman Tutorial Program.

Crisis Center To Aid Counseling

It’s 3 a.m. and you‘re lonely.
Who do you go to? You might
risk your roommate’s wrath
and try to raise him, orprowl
around your hallsearching for
some sound, or walk up the
railroad tracks and talk to
Orion, but in a month you'll
have another option. "TheRes
volving Door", Grinnell's
“on, crisis oriented crisis
center should be in operation.

The idea for such a center
grew out of last year's drug
symposium and from a geners
a1 feeling of need. Out of 90
student applicants, 50 were
selected to go through a three
to four week training period
this fall. Jim Tederman, Pru—
dence Milite, Ed Leong, Don
Bouwens, Bill Abdallah, Rose-
mary Ash, Rene MohrandDes
nnis Haas are leading the vol-

unteers in small group ses-
sions, emphasizing drug and
emotional counseling. Dr. Da-

' niels, from thePoweshiek COs
’unty Mental Health Clinic is

adding anather dimension to
the training. The trainingpror
cess will be continuous, with
representatives coming from
contact houses in Des Moines
and Cedar Rapids to give bet
ter training in the psycholo»
gical aspects of talkingpeople

Those involved with the cen-
ter want to eliminate the word
"crisis” from people’s atti-
tudes toward it. They secitas
a coordination ofexisting cou-
nseling services, not as us

Faculty Debate Bogs;
Profs Exchange Words

by John Pepper
and Tim Porges

Debate continued through the

last two faculty meetings on
proposals for academic res
form. In successive weekly
meetings, the faculty has vots
ed down first the Clotfelter
Proposal, then the Noble-Err
ickson Proposal, and most
recently the first ofa series
of “amended versions" of the
Clotfelter Proposal.

The controversial Clotfelter
proposal to eliminate course
requirements for graduation
was narrowly defeated two
weeks ago.

The NoblerErickson scheme
for a requirement based dn
divisional distribution neces-
sary for graduation failed lar-
gely on the strength of Miss
Noble's reversal of her pres
vious position on theproposol.
She argued that the proposal,
if implemented under the cur-
rent curriculum, would favor
students in the physical sci-
ences over those in the hums
anities and the social scien-
ces. This is due to the much
greater number of courses of
fered without prerequisites in
the latter divisions as com-
pared tothephysicalsciences,
a ratio of about 3: .

The first order of business
in the faculty's October 19
meeting was the consideration
of the proposal offered for
consideration on October 12
by Alan Jones (history. The
proposal was: (“Each student
is required to complete the
Freshman Tutorial Frogs
ram.") Appeiided to this was
a possible Catalogue descrips
tion of the proposed program,
by way of clarification:

”The freshman tutorial prO'
gram is a creditsfail nonscls
assroom learning experience

to be completed in the first
semester of the freshman
year. Each student will work
closely with his faculty tutor
in preparing a series of es,
says during the semestér,and
the aim of the program is to
introduce entering students
into a new learning experience
emphasizing lndependent stun
dy and writing skills. Satiss
factory completion of the pro-
gram will carry four credits.
The tutor Will also act as the
student’s undorclass acades
mic adviser."

This proposal (which shares
much with the Kintner posi-
tion paper in emphasizing a
greatly strengthened advise
ing program as a prerequi-
site to curricular reform)was
strongly attacked by Morris
Parslow of the French De—
partment who imputed to the
rationale vague and misleads
ing language which he pro-
ceeded to quote to the tune of
three or four carefully selecr
ted phrases.

Jones replied that he found
it hard to believe that,he had
actually said those things,and
doubted in fact that he had.
Investigation showed that he
indeed had not said them.
Jones then said he would pres
sume that none of Parsiow's
ether criticisms had any but
metaphorical substance.
Nevertheless, the proposal
was set aside, and the faculty
returned to consideration of
“modified Clolfeltet propo-
sals" which provide for spe-
cial requests by the humanis
ties division. Proposed were
(1) a "norrcquiremenis"cur-
riculum with a one semester
humanities requirement, and
(2) a “n0"requit‘ements" curs
riculuin with a two semester

Students Scoreln SAGA Battle

by Jon Stein

Quesrion: “whydoesn'tGrins

have SAGA".

In what amounted to be the
biggest Studentspower demon-
stration of the year, over one
hundred students turned out to
voice complaints and suggesr
tions at a meeting attended by
the deans, the SGA president,
and the SAGA brass. No Virs
ginia, they didn't want to take
over the school or protest the
war; they wanted to eat good
food. As it turns out, this may
be the hortestissue ofthe year,
as the SAG/i brass appeared
thunderstruck at both the at-
tendance and the nature of the
complaints. Leadsoff batter
in the first inning, SAGA Jere

SAGA does not operate on a
high profit margin. The stue
dents then rapped out a single

arged exorbitant rates for
meals. SAGA, not to be out-
donc, asked the Students to
realize that if everyone’s gu~
ests, or even everyone who
doesn't eat, all of a sudden
started coming to meals, the
board rates would go up. Her

ped a fly (that was dropped)
by asking why those who don't
want to eat SAGA food are
forced to pay for it. SAGA was

when he tried to explain the
high overhead involved in the
running of two “feeding

Faculty Council Kills

Interim l970,aproposal con-
ceived by Eugene A. Herman of
the mathematics department,
met last week with ﬂat rejec-
tion. The program, which was
to have taken place between
semesters here atthe college,
was to have involved avariety
of communities and people ,
students, faculty, townspeo-
ple, area alumni, andparents.
The interim wouldhaveallow-
ed for classes and formats
that ordinarily cannot be taut
ght during the regular school
year. Some of the proposed
seminars were similar to Fri
ee University offerings and
included organic farming,
psychology of personality, ph-
ilosophy of psychology, films
and fllmmaking, automobile
mechanics, computer progra-
mming, the military~industrc
ial establishment, black and
white phomgraphy, and waste
disposal problems of Grinnell
industries.

Why was such a proposalree
jected by the Faculty Execu-
tive Council and President
Leggett? Their reasons were
several and widespread. The
contention was that opening
the school for an estimated
270 people at this time would
be too costly and that anearly
opening prior to second sem-
ester would involve problems
in housing, food, social, and
educational facilities. Also,
their decision was partially
based on the poor turnout at
the drug conference and other
recent symposiums. It was
feared that student participa
tion would be lacking. Inaddi-
tion, the Faculty Executive
'Council feared that a failure

humanities requirement.
These can be only loosely
termed "modifications" of

the Clotfelter proposal, since'

they implicitly reject (by ac
cepting even onerequirement)
the rationale which is the
heart of Clorfelter' s Proposal
III of the FacultySummerStu-
dy Committee.

Time allowed the faculty to
squabble only about the two
semester requirement. Andin
keeping with the gelding ofthe
Clotfelter proposal, discus
sion centered not upon the
suppositions involved in any
specific requirements, but
rather upon the merits of the
humanities courses taught
here.

The debate centered upon
assertions by Edward Moore
and James Kissane (Human-
ities Division) that the course
supplied a common backgrr
ound in ”Great Books" and
provided a general level of
competence in writing and ex-
position. This latterassertion

triggered the bulk of the sub-

Interim~

and asserted that more could
have been appropriated. They
also felt that the proposal pre
sented an opportunity to im-
prove the college's relations
with town, alumni andparents.
The students, however, voiced
the hope that some sort of ins
terim program will be recon-
sidered in the future.

sequent debate.

Gene Wubbles (chemistry)
questioned whether ”writing
skills" were generic, orwher
ther, in fact, the appropriate
skills varied from discipline
to discipline, a different form
of exposition appropriate to
each different‘method.

Greg Guroff remarked in a
protracted exchange with Kis-
sane that if Humanities did
improve skills in writing, then
most of his students . . must
have been Virtual illiterates
when they came here." (Gent
eral laughter, scattered cries
of "hear, hear".

The question was also raised

as to what proportion of stud*
ents could be expected to take
the course were it not re-
quired. Moore estimated that
about 60% of the students could
be expected to do so.

The debate was stopped only
to allow a vote defeating the
two semester requirement as
tied to the reduced Clotfelter
proposal. Debate then resumr

The President also noted
that, in the past few years,
the campus has lostmore than
125 large elm trees as a re-
sult of Dutch elm disease. As
funds become available for the
replacement of these trees,
professional planning will be
important to integrate ncwpl-

Another major employment
of Tyler's talents and exper-

OCTOBER 23, 1970

by Chris Decker

Rock culture finds expres"
sion in many ways. The inOst
visible of these is in the pro-
liferation of bands and indivir
dual artists who regard the
listening public as a long-
haired offshoot of the LBW’
rel-ice Welk generation. Thus,
it is no surprise to find that
the themes which dominate
most rock art are as uninter-
esting as they are insincere:
the Alienation of the Non-Vior
lent Idealistic College Stud-
ent, You Can‘t Make a Revo'
lution with Flowers, How I
Planted the Seed of Love and
Watched it grow into a Mean
ingful Interpersonal Relation-
ship, and so forth.

Against this formidable are
ray of schmaltz, a few artists
try to speak intelligently. Fr-
ominent among them is Paul
Kantner of the Jefferson Air-
plane. His development as a
songwriter reﬂects the crys-
tallization of his aestheticand

cultural opinions.

His two songs on Surrealis-
tic Pillow, “Today" and
“D.C.B.A.-25," already hint
at a departure from the ”Air-

’ plane sound." Here Kantner

appears pensive and earnest,
uncertain but willing to give
thought a chance before falir
ing to obese imagery and
moneyrgrabbing.

Crown of Creation

Kant-ner's first strong state‘
ments come on "Crown of
Creation. The title song is ta-
ken almost verbatim from a
novel by John Wyndham, The
Chrysalids. The novel takes
place 200 years after a nuc-
lear war, in a society oflsur~
vivors. These survivors are
very conscious of mutation
because of the vast genetic
damage done by radiation. Any
mutant form of life-- be it
cornstalk, cow, or child" is
destroyed immediately. Two
children become aware hyacr
cident that they are able to
communicate telepathically
with one another. Eventually
they are discovered and are
forced to flee.

The story line, admittedly,
is somewhat hyperbolic; the
important ideas are implicit.
As human beings, we consid-
er the wholesale extermina-
tion of other forms of life to
be an ethically neutral aCLIVi’
ty when these other species
threaten our position at the
“crown of creation.” Witness
our campaigns againSt bac-
teria, insects, and rodents.
Thus it seems that murder is
a meaningful concept only wi-
thin a given species. In the
case of homo sapiens, thepro-
blem is somewhat more diffi’

cult, since we don’t Imowwhat
man is.

Now, the sixty- four dollar
question. To what extent must
a human mind differ from the
"norm" before the change is
a change in species? For ex-
ample, does the intensificar
tion of a particular sense con-
stitute a qualitative change?
We do not jail people who have
extremely good hearing or
sight. It seems, then, that a
qualitative change may involve
a new sense, or the psychold
gical equivalent of a new
sense. If, in fact, there are
people who are qualitatively
different from the rest of hu-
manity, to what extentare they
justified in defending their own
species? If they used our ex-
ample, theywouldexterminate
anything which gets in their
way.

Pooneil Corner

To return to Paul Kant-her,
the interlude in the title song
on Crown of Creation is a
quatrain borrowed, withminor
changes, from Wyndham‘s
book:

In loyalty to their kind

They cannot tolerate our
‘ minds ‘

In loyalty to our kind
We cannot tolerate

obstruction

This rather vague songsket-
ches the outlines ofa concept
which is developed more fully
in the brumlly melancholy
"House at Pooneil Corner.”

an atmosphere reminiscent of

Kantner, lost in the wild con-
fusion of Muzak, Jerry Rubin,
and The Guess Who. Thus
Kantner declares:

That's the last hour to think

Jelly and juice and bubbles

Bubbles on the floor

The song ends with an un‘
fortunately camp variation on
Winnie the Pooh.

Song of Despair

"House at Pooneil Corner"
is not perfect: it has an inter-
lude by Marty Balin which is
extremely inappropriate, and
some of Kantner's images
border on the insipid (The
moon circles / Likea vulture).
Nonetheless, it is a powerful
song, and it even has a gen-
yearwine no-breastebeating
statement of desperation.

Kantner's other song
Crown of Creation, “In
Time," is more reflective
than the other two. Thematicr
ally it is insubstantial; how
ever, there is a strong hint
of ”Wooden Ships" in theme
lody. '

Ironic Mocking

"We Can be Together," far
from being an anthem for po
litical revolution, seems tome
to be principally personal and
cultural in emphasis, as well
as exceedingly ironic. There
are lines in which Kanmer
appears to be mocking the id-
iotic mentality of the Teeny—
Bop - Problem ' Child» Right
>Onr Brother elite:

We are obscene lawless hi7
deous dangerous dirty vio-
lent and young.

Yes indeed.

The serious intent ofthe song

seems to be in the lines:

This seems to me to be an
extension and intensifimtion
of john Lennon's advice back
in 1968: '

You say you'll change the

constitution

You better free your mind

instead. -

Kantner says, in effect, that
the radical “ethic" is just as
puerile as the Madison Aven-
ue “ethic.”

In sum, the rock movement
(at its best) is aminor cultur-
al phenomenon which is char-
acterized by clean thought
lines and precision of feeling.
We who feel an affinity for the
rook medium should expect no
less than this from our song-
writers.

the fetal campaigns for the
most illustrious office of SGA
president. Perhaps you con~
sider any such analysis as
premature. Perhaps you are
correct. However, I submit
that several politicos on mm,
pus have already made the tie
cision to run for this office.
And with this goalin mind they
have already begun to struc-
ture their activities. I submit
that four prospective contenr
ders are Bill Thomas, Al Ha-
mmond, Jon Stein, and A1 C0-
hen.

Bill Thomas, in an attempt
to extend the Thomas dyn-
asty, is approaching the pres
blem in a straightforward ma-
nner. He is trying to develop
the greatest political expertA
ise and knowledge so as to
overwhelm his opponents with
his competence. His open po-

litical aspirations may work
against him. He will appeal to
the various radicalrmoderate
lcnowledgables, but this block
of votes will not be enough.
He must gain some freshman
vote . . smile harder Bill!

Al Hammond, machiavellian
that he is, will lay low until
the final moments of the cam*
paign. He realizes that the
more he is known, the less
chance he has ofwinning. With
a show of sincerity and power
he is trying to build‘a dormir
tory power base from which to
launch himself. He is a black,
and will win the black vote
only if he is the sole black
candidate. But he definitely
will appeal to the pseudodib-
eral freshmen. Al must work
on his Bill Cosby imitations.

Jon Stein, politically indepr
endent yet knowledgable, must
preform some impressive
maneuver to bring “the peo-
ple" behind him, perhaps lib?
erate the Forum or have an
article written about him in
the Grinnell Magazine. Jon is
definitely a man to oppose the
political bullcrap of the Bru-
ner Thomas- Loewi conSETr
sus, right or wrong. Jon must
stay cool nd flash his ten
speed modi ied english racer
around more.

Finally Al Cohen, radicalyet
sincere, might not be able to
avoid the temptation of the
meaningful office of SGA pre~
sident. Radically versed, pO‘

The SAGA Experience: A“?!

by J. C. Labowitz

Qie of the favorite topics for
discussion around here (at
least one of my favorite topics)
is that institution so close to
our esophagusi, SAGA food.
Some tend to view SAGA as
one of Grinnell's art forms,
along with football gmes and
the Forum grill. Certainly st—
anding in lunch line to eat
Beef Biscuit Surprise must
be classified as a group thea-
ter experience. The ebb and
flow of Grinnelltypeswander»
ing through the dining halls,
along withassorted dogs, cats,
little kids, prospectives and
occasional bat in the Quad,
makes SAGA enjoyable if not
down right tolerable.

Some sort of epitome of Gr-
innell—SAGA theaterrart took
place Tuesday night, which, if
you remember the heartburn,
was Mexican night (ole, or
whatever Right 01 is in Span»
ish). That night saw a world

record shattered-the record
for eating SAGA tacos at one
meal. The old record was set
by the infamous Jim Lew, who,
at lunch at Cowles one day in
the spring of '69, forced down
27 taste-temptingSAGA,tacos.
This record stood until Tues-
day, when Mark Hamilton‘of
Ames, Iowa and Clark Hall,
took aim at that record and,
in a Herculean effort, conr
sumed 28 tacos in about 90
minutes. He finished the last
taco atthe Forum and received
an ovation at the SAGA grill
meeting in South Lounge.

One more thing aboutSAGA ,
anyone frequenting Cowleshas
to be impressed with the way
SAGA Jo runs things over
there (she's the one in the
Schlitz bowling shirt on Fri»
days). She has been in the hos-
pital, andwe wishhera speedy
recovery and hope she gets
back dishing the Shepherd’s
Pie real soon.

litically active, Cohenwill find
little real support on the pseu-
do? left, most ofwhom graduar
ted and sold out to the various
institutions (a' la the Woodrow
Wilson School of Political Sc-
ience)l Cohen must moderate
his approach and become a bit
more objectively critical of
the Grinnell situation.

Decisions Come Down

In order to alleviate what
they called the “uncontrollr
able” line-cutting problem,
an AdrHoc Senate committee
has formulated the following
rules and procedures:

Only four categories of stu-
dents are allowed to cutSAGA
lines:

a.) SAGA workers who are
working the meal for which
they arecutting. Workers are
encouraged if at all possible
to eat the early SAGA meal
instead of cutting the cafeteria
line. SAGA workers who are
nOt working a specific meal
can cut, but are obliged to
substitute if necessary. Cuts
can only be taken in the cafe-
teria at which the worker
works.
lb.) “Jocks" who have just
completed practice. Athletes
are permitted to cutonlyafter
their practice, and they are
permitted to but only during
the season of the sport in \th
ich they participate. Jock cuts
are permittedonlyatthe even-
ing meal Monday through Frir
day.

c.) Those people who have
classes that adjourn at 11:50
or later and who also have a
class or lab that begins at
12:30 or 12:45. Those people
are permitted to cut if, in
their judgement, it would be
impossible for them to wait
in line and get to their class

Political Activity At A low

by Laurie McCallum

With the sermlled “Election
break" approaching, it is
ironic tonote the politicalapa‘
thy that is engulfing Grinnell.
There appears to be little or
no interest on campus inpolir
tical campaigning as evinced
by the problems facing the
Blobaum-forCongress moi
vement now underway. This is,
in fact, the only such move
ment on campus.

‘ Circulars, posters,andmeeo
tings aroused the support and
active participation of around

20 people in the Blobaum mm’

paign for Democratic congre-
ssman from this district . . .
20 people out of an enrollment
of 1265 Students.

This is certainly a radical
drop in the level of political
involvement from that sure
rounding last year’s moratorr
ium and this year's Cambod-
ian crisis. David Landecker,
president of the Student Dem-
ocratic Coalition, cites sevr
eral reasons for this.

Basically, he says, students
were "turned off" by the Nix-

(Continued to page 7)

or lab on time after a reason-
ably relaxed meal.

d.) A person who has a bona
fide class or activity which
he will be unable to attend on
time unless he cuts. Such a
student, if at all possible, shv
ould make arrangements togo
to the cafeteriaatatimewhich
will allow him to get to his
activity on time without
cutting.

It is illegal for a friend to
accompany a person taking an
otherwise legal cut. It is ille»
gal to hold a place in line for
a person unless he entered the
line at the same time as the
holder and had to leave mom'
entarily.

Abuse of cutting rules and
privileges is one of the big-
gest reasons why the cutting
problem is so great. If only
these four categories of peo-
ple cut the lines, most of the
difficulty would be solved. It
is everyone's responsibility
to be aware of the cutting ru-
les and to enforce the rules
on themselves, and if some
refuse to control themselves
to enforce the rules on others.

Whenever anyone cuts into
the cafeteria line, it» is his
responsibility to state to the
people directly behind him
briefly and politely why he is
cutting. The people who are
directly behind those who cut
should probablyaskwhyaper»
son is cuttingifthe cutter does
not volunteer the information.

If students will cooperate
with theabove-statedpolicies,
the lineecutting problem can
be solved. Grinnell students
who claim they are adult en-
ough to live together with a
minimum of coercion have a
chance to prove it. Let’s see
if we really are adult enough
to govern ourselves.

The a‘b‘ove statementwaswr-
itten by Greg Vranimr and
amended and approved by Pe-
ter Palmisano, Chris Anderr
son, Kathy Ogle and Barry
Zigas. It will become official
policy upon publication‘in Vr-
anicar's epistle scheduled for
distribution early next week.

Grinnell EducationCanChange

, by Henry Scheff

Grinnell has had a Free Uni»
versity on and off for a few
years. It has always been plar
gued by lack of enthusiasm
manifested in the small num-
ber of course offerings, the
small number of students who
participated, and the rate of
failure of the courses. The
present Free University
seems to have fallen into the
some rut.

However, this cannot be taken
as evidence that students are
satisfied with the academic
environment here. Manystud-
ents who feel that academics
at Grinnell are inadequate
take independent projects and
group seminars. This consu-
mes much of their time, and
they get credit for these ef-
forts, so why participate in a
Free University? It seems
clear that students who are
dissatisfied are still into going
to college, working for credit,
and getting a degree. Thus,
any meaningful alternative to
the educational process at
Grinnell must work in part
through the institution in order
to gin the sanction ofthe col-
lege.

A feasablc plan for an alter-
native is within easy reach of
students who are committed
enough to make it work. At
present, possibilities existfor
groups of students to get colr
legc credit for Group Inde-

pendent Projects. The plan is
simply to bring students ter
gether soon to begin planning
a whole series of these group
independents. Sincc old limit
tations on the amount of inde-
pendent study a student could
take were abolished at the
beginning of the semester, a
student could concievably take
all his work in independent
study. The possibility also
exists for students to get more
than four credits for a single
project if they can justify the
additional credits. Thus, six-
teen-credit group independ-
ents are not out of the ques-
tion, especially if they are
interdisciplinary in nature.
What can an emersion in
Group Independent Study do
for a Student7 It has the po-
tential of giving him a voice
in every aspect of the acad-
emic situation, including de-
signing the course, picking
the professors, picking the
methods, materials, methods
of evaluation, class procedr
ures , in Other words,itgives
the student a real opportunity
to participate in a truely col-
lective educational experi?
nce. Students may be encour
aged to interact with other
students for criticism and in-
formation rather than relying
on the professor for all of
these things.

It is not hard to imagine
what effect this might have on
the college if many students

became interested in this sort
of work. Professors might
have to drop courses to free
time for consultation on these
projects, and departments
might have to change offerings
to attract students who could
otherwise do independents.
The end result could bea dra‘
matic change in Grinnell Col-
lege.

This, of course, is pure spe-
culation. However, at worst,
this experiment will certainly
make next semester more in? ‘
teresting. If you are interes»
ted in this sort of educational
experience (and, if success
ful, these projects may be
rougher thannormal courses),
put your name, box number,
and phone number in the box
marked EXPERIMENTAL
COLLEGE in the post office,
and expect to begin to work
HARD after midsem break to
plan these projects and make
it work.

Diplomat Visits Campus,
Pushes Foreign Service

by Mark Sablemon

Myron Koenig, retired Dean
of the Foreign Service lnStl’
tute of the State Department,
was here Monday to speak on
“The State Department and
the Academic Community."

Mr. Koenig addressed him~
self to the "gap of misunder-
standing" between the Dep-
artment and the universities
and said that the gap is neir
ther new nor easily bridged.

Much of the gap is histori-
cal ,_ it was not, for exam-
ple, until 1946 that Congres
created the Foreign Service
Institute (FSI) with relation to
the State Department analon
gous to the relationship betw-
een the military institutes
such as West Point and Anna
polls and the Defense Departs
merit.

The military institutes, Koen
nig explained, “train men to
win a conflict when it breaks
out; the function of the SF
ate Department and its train-

‘ ing institute, the F51, is “to
try and preclude that conflict
from breaking out in the first
place.‘I

Koenig emphasized the im-
portance of the Foreign Ser-
vice Institute by telling of a
visit by President Kennedy
in 1963. The President, on
this rare visit to a relatively
small part of the government,
complimented the shaff on the
fine job they were doing to
prepare foreign service offie
cers to understand the coun-
tries they were assigned to.

Russian A

by Debby McKnight.

To the clinking of coffee cups
on saucers, Professor James
Billington made his first ad*
dress on the Grinnell campus
October 2i. 01 the faculty of
Princeton University, Billing-
ton's impressive Russian culr
tural and historical credent-
ials include his book, The Icon

and the Axe, an interpretive ‘

cultural history of ‘Russia.
Russian majors, history and
language students comprised
the bulk of a sizable audience
at Grinnell House for the in-
formal morning ofdiscussion.
The principle topic was the
seventeenth'century Church
Schism. This split, analogous
to the Western Reformation,
affected an equal number of
people and hadsimilar impore

it .

Kennedy asked, however, to
what degree the PSI prepared
the diplomat for representing
the United States in foreign
countries. This remark, Koee
nig said, triggered a reorder”
ing of the curriculum within
the FSI toward better educat-
ing the diplomat in American
studies.

The foreign service exam
as it is now set upfavors Ame
erican Studies as the college
major most likely to prepare
a man or woman as a dip10*
mat; at least, those who may
or in it are more likely to
pass the exam. The majors
with the next highest probab-
lity of passing the exam are
philisophy, mathematics, in-
ternational trade, Russian
studies, chemistry, econom-
ics, history, politicalscience,
and English.

These top ten offortymajors
show the emphasis on the exe
am and in the State Depart-
ment is for breadth of know
ledge, rather than depth in
any particular academicarea.
Majors in specificforeign lan<
guages are often notas advan-
tagious to the Department
as it might seem, Koenigsaid,
since approximately 20% of
those majors require further
training by the F51.

Rearrangements or expan—
si'ons of the State Depart-
ment’s academic curriculum,
however, are not enough to
bridge the gap between the
Department and the acader

Prol Studies Faculty Workload

man of theEconomics Depart-
ment recently completed an
analysis of the faculty work
load and its relation tostudent
demand as a factor in salary

rtists Gain Freedoms

tant effects on the society in
which it occurred. Besides
answering specific questions
about the Schism, Billington
dealt with it as an example of
cultural revolution and an il‘
lustration of several recur-
rent themes in Russianhis
tory.

He also spoke more gener-
ally about Russian societyand
suggested what he considered
one of its greatest strengths:
"I think we're coming to the
end of the age in whichwe held
the belief - very widespread
in the West , that there are
political solutions toall human
problems. In this respect Rus-
sian culture is far ahead ofus
because they never accepted
that kind of thing in the first
place."

to another question, Billings
ton made some of his mOSt
provacative comments in re-
ference to the study of his-
tory: ”Nothing is more irre—
levant than the hiStory of ten

or fifteen years ago . . . You,

have to go back at least 100
years to findanything ofvalue.
People are running around
new setting up courses in re*
volution because they think
everybody's in a revolution-
ary mood. Students are doing
things nobody understands, so
everybody‘s Studying the Re—
volution of 1917. But I believe
that the events leading to the
revolts of 1848 are far more
applicable now."

Following the discussion,
Billington lunched with sev—
eral students and Russian face
ulty members where the con-
versation included the prof
essor's own revolutionary th-
eory. A true revolution must
be a complete change from
existing cond' ons back to a
“natural state." Since this
involves such toral change, no
revolutionary party can anti-
cipate its results and should
not attempt or be expected to
attempt describing a program
of "what it will be like after
the revolution." late in the
afternoon Billington wasagain
available in the Forum coffee
house when American educa—
tion joined Russia as a cone
vers‘ation topic.

His evening lecture, “Nature
and Significance of Intellec-
tual Ferment in the Soviet
Union," began by classingSor
viet dissent with a world-wide
search for humanism in reac~
tion against modern bureaus
cracy and technology. Specifr
ically in Russia, Billington
considered the ferment of
youth and of renewed internal
nationality conflicts. His gr»
eatest emphasis was on the

(Continued to page 7)

expenditure for the college.

He saw the need for the study
as a member of the Executive
Council last year when he was
constantly confronted with a
lack of information as to the
cost of certain programs and
the use of faculty time.

His study concerns someasr
pects of the economics invol-
ved in faculty manpoweras re-
lated to student enrollment,
in hopes of arriving at a con-
clusion about possible re-dis-
tribution of future workloads
which might cut down on the
necessary number of faculty.

A brief explanation ofVoertr
man’s study follows, but, as
the author himself stressed,
“It defies any useful inferen-
ces about quality variables
among programs."

For purposes of research,
work loads were established
in terms of points, which inn
cluded courses taught for cre-
dit, labs, independent project
supervision, appliedmusicler
ssons, direction of perform-
ance groups, contact hours in
coaching and recreation pro
gram work, and were extend-
ed to special tasks such as

administrative dutie. . Exam-

ples of these measurements

are as follows:

Regular course . . . 3points

Independent project . . .1 point l

Labs in credit courses . . . 2

The assignment ofpoints was
made according to a system
developed at Princeton which
enjoys wide use.

Using this system, tenpoints
per semester (twenty per
year) was consideredanormal
workload for each faculty men
mber.

According to the data from
the academic year 1969770,
Voertman measured workao
tivities of the faculty usingthe
point system, which yielded
the following results:

mic community. ’l‘liat gap exr
iSts mostly in the minds of
both parties, Koenig said, and
exchanges between the departr
ment and the universities (an
be helpful.

As one step toward bridge
ing the gap, the State Depart»
ment is giving its foreign
service officers leaves of ab-
sence to study and work at
a university, usually with the
political science department.
Here, Koenig said, the diploe
mat has time to think and ex-
change ideas with Others who
often have a different perspct
tive.

One such Diplomatrin-Res-
idence was john Guthrie,prer
sently the number two man
in the Embassy in Sweden,
who was at Grinnell for the
last academic year. Koenig
said that he had heard from
Guthrie, and that he consider-
ed his experiences at Grinr
nell among the richest he has
had. The only problem he saw,
Guthrie told Koenig, was how
to apply what he had learned
at Grinnell at his desk in
Stockholm.

The exchange between the
State Department and the unr
iversities works both ways;
there is also a program for
academics in residence at the

State Department. The aca-
demic who spends eight morr
ths working at the State De
partment might easily conw
elude, as one Pomona pro-
fessor quoted by Koenig, that
the entire atmosphere was
different.

Defense and Deadlines

At the university, the Pom-
ona professor said, work is
directed towards the writing
of a paper as an end. /\t the
State Department, however,
it is only a beginning: the
paper must be defended to all
sorts of experts and com-
mittees, and strict dead

lines are in force throghout Men,

the decision- making process.

These deadlines,Koenigpro-
posed, constitute one of the
most important reasons for
the perhaps irreconcible gap
between the Department of
State and the academic com-
munity. At State, deadlines
are opposed by events, and
quick policy making is im-
perative. The foreign ser
vice officer, who must make
a decision and take respon-
sibility for it, man not take
the time to think it through
as the academian can.

The professor, Koenig said,
is free to say what he thinks,
and he has plenty of time for
contemplation. The diplomat,
on the Other hand, must be
more careful and more spr
eedy in his thoughts and ac
tions, for he must. make 3

decision which will have dire

That gap, then, between the
academic community and the
State Department, is very
much one of time, according
to Koenig. 01 a larger scale,
it is the gap between theory
and application.

Theory and application must
live together Keonig concluded
--the saying that “diplomacy

icy without diplomacy is use-

Students Steam SAGA

but you can feed them all of
the time". One word could be
used to sum up the descrip
tions of the food that was dis-
cussed: BAD. The third, {curt
th, and fifth innings saw the
Students bring up complaint
after complaint while the SGA
president tried not to laugh
and Dean Walker felt lucky to
be an administrator for the
first time in his life. TheSAGA
brass restricted their strat-
egy to writing down the com,
plaints and asking questions.

("Is it bigger than a bread
box?"). SAGA finally get on
base by getting a compliment
on the salad bar and a testi-
monial that they now put ore
ange juice into the water.

The sixth and seventh inn-
ings were devoted to mean
line drives over the high g1"
ease content of the food, and
fancy fielding by SAGA. ”Yes,
i would say that there isa dif
ference between frying and
deep-frying". Even the let:
tuce looked green when SAGA
scored their first run on the
compliment, "your brocoli
last Thursday was memorab»
ly good"; however, the Slud’
ents then scored quickly on the
bad coffee and the breaded
veal.

The remaining innings were
lackluster. With most of the
students off the field, the BIG
STARCH MACHINE still
managed to have four more
runs scored against them, by
them.

And so the students won,

right? Wrong. What the play
ers had not realized was that
SAGA owns the ballpark, runs
the league, hires the umpires
and kept the scoring sheets.
So we may never know the

. Bureau To Provide
Speakers For Town

The College Relations Come
mittee plans to set up a Spear
kers Bureau for various town
organizations, modeled on the
Des Moines student speakers
bureau this summer in res-
ponse to the campus activism
of last spring.

The Committee feels thatthe
expertise of members of the
college community should be
made available to towns-
people. The opportunity for
sharing college resources al-
ready exists in regular civic
group, church, and service
club meetings appropriate for
topical presentations of gen-
eral or specific interest. The
Committee hopes that through
the establishment of this Sp-
eakers Bureau the current die
vision between college and
town activities can be bridged
and broader community con-
cern can develop.

Any persons who wish to of-
fer their services should con-
tact Mario Bognanno or Care
olyn Canfield for further in-
formation.

gap. Student volunteers may
provide the non—professional
outlook that is sometimes nee—
ded to solve aproblem. Some
times just the knowledge that
such a service is available
can be helpful.

The center is set upasanonr

college can't be held respont
sible for any of its actions.

 

The administration has given
its sanction through financial
assistance. Being independent
from the rest of the college,
the center is not bound togive
any information on particular
students to theadministration.
An informal agreement has
also been reached with the po-
lice; Chief Peters agreed to
analyze or dispose of any
drugs given to him with no
questions asked. Dr. Daniels
has agreed to be a consultant
and attempts are being made
to obtain a local doctor for
consultation. .

case. An organized group from
the town which is concerned
about drugs has been meeting
with the center's staffwith the
hope of setting up their own
center. While no one seeking
help would be turned away,
campus acceptance will have
to be present before the center
is officially opened to the town.

In addition to the counseling
services, the center hopes to
establish an up-to»date refer
ence library on drugs, emo-
tional problems and counselr
ing techniques, and to bring
some exploratory programs to
the campus, utilizing small
group techniques.

The center will be open in
about 4 weeks. Located in
Mears basement, it will be
open Monday through Friday,
4 p.m. to 8 a.m., and 24hours
on Saturday and Sunday. Pr~
ior to its opening, represent—
atives will bring the center’s
policy statement and operat-
ing procedures to floor and
hall meetings and explain the
actual activities.

However, this evaluation did
not incorporate the distribu'
tion of students and ignored
the demand for each course.
Thus, there was subsmntial
variation in the t0tal enrolls
ment (measured in credit
hours) per instructor and in
the number of credit hours
per instruction point. With a
SLUdEntrfaCulty ratio often to
one, each faculty memberwor
uld be responsible for 320 crer
dits per academic year. How-
ever, the variation from this
norm was substantial, rang
ing from under IUD credit
hours registered for five pro~
fessors, and over 501 credit-
hours registered for thirteen
professors (six ofwhom taught
at least one section of Hume
anities each semester). Thus
the number of credithours per
instruction point ranged from
less than five hours to more
than thirty- five hours for the
year:

time the peak of student in-

results were disappointing.
That, the lack of tangible re

mentum following the Kent
State affair have completely
discouraged students from per
litical involvement.

The Kyl-Blobaum race is
said to be one of the ten most
important Congressional el—
ections in the country. Kyl,
the incumbent, has been clas-
sified by the Progressive Mar
gazine as “one of the seven
most vulnerable Republican
hawks in the November elec-
tions."

This would seem grounds for
some slight interest, but when
Blobaum visited the Grinnell
campus, he spoke to a group
of only fifteen people. Grinnell

very little interest in Iowa

Princeton Scholar Discusses Russian Culture

intelligentsia. Since Russia
has only one politiml party,
the intelligentsia is the near
est thing to an opposition. lt
ins what Billington called

“moral authority” in Russian
society. Connected with this,
he made a case‘ for seeing
artistic leaders like Solzhen-
llsyn as "saints who givemo-
rill purity" to the intelligent
tsia. They can give this quav
llty particularly because most
iii the “saints" have suffered
in government camps. This
purged them of “fear and pe-
ttiness" and left them come
pletely ready to challenge the
government. In turn, because‘
these people are considered
“saints," the governmentﬂ-
nds it almost impossible to
seriously harass them.

This is true because the new
artists have the scientists’and
cngineers’ support. Billing-
ton claimed that there is a
real threat of dangerously a1-
ienating the technologists if
the artists are attacked. Since
the Soviet economy, so depen-
dent on these people, isnow in

poor shape, the government
cannot risk a further SIOWr
down by any action to upset
the technical community. Th—
erefore, Billington suggested
that the government will not
prevent Solzhenitsyn from
going to Stockholm for the

Novel Prize. His opinion was
that the Party would disapr
prove but then “look the other
way and take the flak." What—
ever the government's action,
it will give the WeSt a clear
indication of where the Party
now stands on dissent.

Besides considering the
"saints" as focal points for
protest, Billington discussed
various other methods of diet
sent. One which he found par
ticularly signiﬂmnt was the
change in the civil rights moi
vement from distributing ans
nonymous tracts to sending
signed letters to Pravda and
Izvestia. Such action is less
dramatic but may be moreef-
fective. The writers cannot
be accused ofattemptingmar»
tyrdom.

Billington was ofcourse hesr
itant about predicting the odds
for intelligentsia reform of
Soviet society: “We should

n0t underestimate the power
and survival ability of the Co-
mmunist leaders;" they came
out on top of a Revolution and
have been there forhalfa cen-
tury. Still, Eillington saw der
finite positive value in what
the intelligentsia has accom-
plished thus far. He compared
the intellectual to “a battered
defensive lineman on a team
that has been constantly de-
feated. Suddenly he surges ah-
ead, and while he maynoteveu
score, the spectators are th-
rilled at having something to
cheer about . . . (they) take
greater interest in thegame.”

Billington quoted one Russian
who said: ”I feel .much closer
to Pasternal sincehe diedLl'lan
I ever didwhile he wasalive."
Apparently, the intelligentsia
has done something to revita-
lize Soviet seciety, anditsin-
ﬂuence may continue long
after the present generation
of artists. -

Gridders Spoil Rums’
'Kill A Freak Week’

One of the fraternity houses
overlooking Cornell's football
stadium had a sign on it as
part of Cornell's Homecom-
ing decorations saying some-
thing to the effect that Grint
nell College was a Commun-
ist plot. Grinnell's gruesome
gaggle, the Ob Squad, taking
this as their leading cheer
(“Grinnell's a Commie PIA
ot"), got the twoeplusbusloads
of fans from hippiedom up for
the observance of the success
ful dissolution of Cornell’s
Homecoming festivities; by
those Marxists from Grinnell,
the football Pioneers. The fit
nal score was Pinkoes 28,
Cornell 24.

Things looked bleak early in
the game for the hairy Pion'
eers as Cornell rammed the
ball down our throats for two
quick field goals and a 6’0
lead. “Gorgeous" Gary John-
son finally got Grinnell’s of-
fense going with a Screenpass
to “Hurricane" Henry Corona
for long yardage. The boyish
quarterback then fired a bomb
to "Jimmy Jet" Pirolli for
a TD and Grinnell was on top
7-6.

After both teams failed to
move for awhile, Cornell fins
ally got a drive going and sct
ored to go back up 13-7. Late
in the first half, however,
Cornell got mlled for inter-
ference in the end zone, and
“Gorgeous" Cary tookadvarr
rage of this award to ease the
ball in by handing to Closeline
Alston for a touchdown and a
14-13 lead for the hippies.
Cornell then came right back
with what appeared to be a
scoring drive in the waning
seconds of the half, only to
have Nick “the Conserva-
tive" Russo intercept quar-
terback Steger's pass in the
endzone. “

At the start of the second
half, the hippies from Grinv
nell threatened to blow the
game apart as they scored in
their first drive on a ‘flea-
ﬂicker’ from ”6.0." to "Hu~
rricane" with ”Right: on" Ed
Hirsch at the pivot. The an-
archists made it 28-13 on an-
other bomb from Johnson to
"Jimmy Jet".

Cornell was not to be beaten
so easily, however. The Rams
came back with a touchdown
of their own and added a two-
point conversion to run the
count to 28-21. A fourth quar-
ter field goal by Cornell put
the confrontation’s outcome
in doubt at 28-24. However,
in the final moments of the
game, after letting Cornell
off the hook twice on fourth
down situations. the Big Red
Machine finally held and re-

Grinnell's jolly joggers fleXt
ed their calf muscles last
weekend by defeating Cornell
emphatically, 15-43. Stinging
from last week's 5&5 article,
the Pioneers ”skunked” the
Rams by taking the first five
individual places. To add to
the humiliation, our "hairy
ers" even had a few of our
“super-scrubs”, (alias the
"pushers", a‘ completely le-
gal group), place ahead of
their Varsity.

Coach Obermiller had been
called out oftown for theweek,
so the team worked out on their
own. Responding to the relief
of not hearing terrible jokes
and puns, the “thinnies” all
had their best personaltimes.
Each of the top five runners
finished under twentyttwo mi-
nutes, for an all-time record
performance for a Grinnell
Croschountry team. if the
team does not perform aswell
this week, Coach Ois planning
on taking a permanent vacaa
tion.

"Hair— God" Eric Jahn tame
out ahead of Charlie McGrath
in this week's entanglement.
Charlie was suffering from a
“toothietach" and will have it
taken care ofl Monday. Super
Prep Phil Frank came in th-
ird, followed by ”Oscar the
Mechanic" and Johnny ”Red
Cap" Russel.

Having helped the football
team ruin ”KILL A FREAK

are headed Friday to Cedar

the team can avoid injuries.

Soccer Stars Stumble, 7-l Here

Coming off the worst defeat
in recent history at the hands
of Beloit last Saturday, the
Grinnell soccer team will try
to put it back together tomorr
row against Knox. The game
will be played on the Tenth
Street soccer fieldat 1:30pm.
Knox beat the Pioneers at Knox
four weeks ago, 1’0. The game
was played at Knox on a small
and rough football field. Gtitr
nell's larger regulation field
may give the Pione rs the
necessary room to outmaneur
ver their bitter rivals. In last
year's game with Knox in Cr
innell, the Pioneers were vic~
torious 41.

Last week's game turned out
to be an original Grinnell dis-
aster at the hands of Beloit
College. The home fans had
something to cheer about in
the first quarter when Grin~
nell went ahead on CraigGort
don's first goal of the season.
It took a great fake (he fell
down) before Gordon could
shake loose from the Beloit
fullback and put a shot into the
far corner of the goal.

A goal can often provide a
great lift to get an offense
moving; unfortunately, it was
the Beloit offense that scored
two goals in the next fivemint
utes, not Grinnell. Beloit led
4-1 at halftime, and Grinnell
looked tired and ragged thr-
oughout most of the last half.
The final score was Belolt 7,
Grinnell 1. It was the first
Pioneer defeat at home since

I M Corner: Football

The IM football champion‘
ship has, for all intents and
purposes, been decided. The
only things remaining are
team pride and the everprer
sent lust for blood. Clarkl-lall,
with a record of 9-0, clinched
the title Sunday with its 26-18
victory over Read.

Clark eliminated Off- Campr
us 18*0 in a game publicized
as the ”Blood Bowl.” Not [0
disappoint the fans, players
dropped all over the battle-
field. After unforgettable pl-
ays, such as a phantom rush-
ing onto the field and decking
the opposing quarterback, the
game was finally called be-
cause of a headton-colllsion.
Beth teams and the various
partisan onlookers agree that
this decision was probably the
only right call of the after-

n-- .

In an earlier game, OffACa~
mpus had eliminated North in
a close 2218 contest. The
season has been marred by
unnecessary roughness, spec-
tators trying to run thegames,
numerous forfeits, and a lack
of sufficient refereelng. Two
tough games still remain. Hai-
nes challenges the Clark Crer
tins Wednesday and North ta-
kes on the secondtplace Read
Gents.

Now that the 1M footballsear
son hasabout breathed its last,
the volleyball season is about
to begin. What a season that
should be! The profs have de*
cided to try their hand at the
game. They may need more
than hands now that the "B”
league has been made coed.

So IM moves INdoors. _

Grinnell's record is now 3-2.
The Grinnell offense has sco‘
red the same number of goals
as their opponents, ten. Most
of Grinnell's scoringhas come
from the inside forward posi-
tions, where Tom Lincoln has
5 and Steve Korstad has 2.
Each of the wings, Jim Dix
and Craig Gordon, has added
one goal. Steve Hirshon, who
is currently out of action with

torn cartilage in his knee,
scored the other goalfrom his
right halfbackposition. Repla—
cing Steve is Dave Klaus, who
joins Captain Bruce Graham
and Marty Wice at halfback.
The fullbacks are John Vider
rich, Ken (JC) Labowitz, Jack
Couch, and Dave Pritchard.
Dave Coron, with help from
Dave Kaus, is handling the
goal protecting chores.

The Grinnell soccer team is aiming for twelve victor~
ies this season, as evidenced by the number on this
footman's back. Unfortunately, they forgot to schedule

that many games.

The little Pink Toy Falls

The Freshmen Footballteam
is 0.2 so far on the season.
Suffering under their inability
to score and play defense,
(play football (7)), they have
been put down by the Frosh of
Cornell and Knox Colleges.
Against Cornell in their home
opencr, the Little Red lost by
the score of 3370, a very ex»
citing game for the Cornell
fans present. Against Knox. . .
no one on the team willdivulge
the score, but it is rumored
it was over 5070, less than
1000, approximately 7670.

There are a few bright spots
on this untraditional squad,
which follows three undcfcat
ted prep football teams. Finc

efforts are coming from John

“Flower” Potts, "Badman"
George Blakeslcy, and “Fire
plug 11” Don Eognanno. The
truth is that almost half ofthe
team has neverplayetl football
in pads before, giving Coach
Pfitsch a decided handicap.
Carl Cage is also finding this
season very distressing, as
Coach Pfitsch has already Ch‘
