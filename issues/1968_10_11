College Drops
Plan to build
New Dormitory

By BENSON SMITH

A proposal to build a new
dormitory on South campus has
been shelved, according to
Dean Alice Low. Plans for the
building were approved two
years ago «by the Board of
Trustees and a studanaculty
committee, but the dormitory,
which would have housed 150
students, Will not he built.

Mrs. Low said that when she
came to Grinnell plans tor a
dormitory had already been
completed but were not ac-
ceptable to the Board pi Trus-
tees. Under her direction, new
plans were designed and sub-
sequently approved.

when. questioned about the
need for the new building, Mrs.
Low stressed overcrowding,
which she maintains still exists
this year. The dorm had been
planned on the basis of a pro-
jection of the college's future
needs. The data for the projec-
tion was collected in a room-by-
room study conducted two
years ago. Mrs. Low said that
the projection was not based on
any plan to increase enrollment
and that use of all present
dormitories would have con-
tinued. She also claimed that
with the new dormitory, more
students would be able to take
advantage of the oti»campus
living option.

Mrs. Low did not explain how
more students would have been
able to live oil-campus. Last

Tuesday Session

Draws 2 Deans,
400 Undergrods

Last Tuesday the Judicial
Council met in the South
Lounge oi the Forum to hear
the Richard Schneirov case.
Schneirov was charged with
having a girl in his room at
8:00 pm. on September 26 in
Violation of the college's rule
on open dorms.

That the girl had been in hls
room at the time was estabe
lished by Kenneth Etzkom, res.
ident advisor of Loose Hall.
Charges were brought by Dean:
S. Eugene Thompson and Alice
Low. .

Schneirov admitted the pres‘
once of the girl, who is not I
Grinnell student, saying, “The
charges are true, but I plead
‘not guilty.’ The administrae
tion’s authority regulating co<
educan'onal use of residean
halls is illegitimate."

The defense, managed by Ml-
chael Brandon and Bonnie Tin<
ker, attempted to show the ac-
tual situation in residence halls
with respect to the enforcement
of the present visitation rule.

Five hall presidents discussed
their reiusal to comply with the
present rule and stated the in-
lorn-lal policies in their halls.
Most policies were based on
“discretion” and “considera<
lion of others.” All the house

Student Government Speaks

By T. THOMAS, H. FOOTE, L. MAR“.

' ‘Amld extremely long Senate
meetings, petitions, Schneirov’s
ease, student allairs committee
meetings, Iall-(s with Ihe deans
and numerous other meetings
which oiten seem to have no
real signilicance, one tact is not
submerged in the bureaucratic
"democracy” here at Grinnell.
atudent power still remains the
only logical means to bring
about the needed changes at
Grinnell.

As frustration increases with
the present rules, student gov-
ernment continues to act as a
saiety valve for students who
are interested in changing the
present rules. while demon—
strations, sleepsins, and Sit~ins
always alter the most satisly-
ing means to rid oneselt of the
present hypocrisy, it is now
generally recognized that dem-
onstrations, at best, serve only
particular, immediate n e e d s
and are oiten useless in the
long run, That is to say, alter
every demonstration one still
has the Iask of seeing that de-
mands are neither neglected
nor deleted.

Student government at Grin-
nell continues to focus stu-
dents’ attention on needed
changes, yet the tailures of this
Institution are obvious. The
Senate, ior example, represents
\he views of a particular part
of the student body rather than

tem, the SGA representing the
liberal view and SDS the more
radical view. In regards to the

A student, however, does not

The Administration’s Predicament

Because of its past policies the administration of
Grinnell College is in a position where it is going to
have to yield to students’ demands for a change of
rules.

In the past, the administration has said that
one of the reasons the college did not change its
rules was that it preferred not to act before other
colleges. Grinnell chose not to be a leader in the
general laxity in rules that accompanied the wide
acceptance of the “new morality.” Rather, it chose
the safer policy of waiting to see what happened to
the innovators, and then to change slowly and by
degrees.

Other colleges in our own conference have re-
laxed their rules with respect to open dormitories.
Grinnell, in accordance with its “keep up with the
Joneses" policy, will probably change its rules, too.

Now the administration is not so obtuse as those
students mentioned in last week’s editorial,
Ex Post Facto Philosophy. They are not so simple
as to think that they can change the rules and then
adopt a philosophical stand which justifies the
change. They will want to change their philosophy
beforehand, or seek some provision in their old one,
a sort of loophole, which will enable them to change
in a way least damaging to them. The administra-
tion has such a loophole, and there have been indi-
cations that they will take advantage of it.

The revision in the residence hall system is the
perfect time to review the old rules. You see, the
old rules might not be valid under new circum-
stances Hence a thoughtful discussion of the rules
is in order.

It is clear that there are only two stands the
administration can otherwise take. The one is to act
in accordance with what are probably its true
beliefs, it could refuse to change the rules on ac-
count of the underlying moral reasons. If the ad-
ministration, however, chooses to act in this way,
if the president chooses to see that all the rules are
enforced and that the rules remain as they are, he
will probably cause the same sort of disruptive ac-
tivities that occurred at Columbia and forced the
shutdown of that institution, An administration
simply cannot function unless it has the support of
the majority of the students and members of the
community.

The administration could refuse to take any
form of action, to let things fall where they may.
They might capitulate as completely as o t h e 1‘
schools have done. This, however, would not be a‘
{wry honorable way to go about solving the prob-

em.

So probably the best the administration can do
is to undergo this period of review, to justify a
change of rules because of the revision in hall liv-
ing, and thus to capitulate subtly to the demands of
the students.

Now the student government ought to take note
of the administration’s predicament. They ought to
realize that if they now go through channels, they
would be likely to obtain a large helping of what
they want, The administration Will surrender, if it
can do so honorably. To force a confrontation on it
will force it to take a stern standi

If the student government acts with caution
and tact, they may win. If they act impulsively and
try to force a confrontation, they may lose.

Resident Advisor
Rebuke: Problems

To the Editor:

I know lt's a bit early to
make sweeping generalizations
of the kind I am going to make
about Grimell, but as a new-
comer whose expectations
about the place have rather
fallen short, I feel compelled
to speak.

First, this campus boxes the
hell out of me. Compared to
campuses I've been on during
the past three years (North-
western and Yale), the Intellec-
tual excitement and ferment
here is almost nil. The sell job
I got before I came was large-
ly based on how intense, bright,
and scintillating all these stile
dents were going to be. Yet I
must say that after nearly six
weeks here i have yet to hear
anyone talk spontaneously about
what he is reading, either in
class or out, let alone talk about
his classes. I have yet to hear
any passionate discussion or
race, politics, religion, art, eco<
nomics, transplants, or comic
strips. In fact I have yet to
hear any passionate discussion
of anyihihg but the opens “ls-
sue", which is little more than
narcissism in its worst form
coupled with is childish exhibi-
tionism (e.g., declarations of
home rule and publicized cohab-
itation), Whatever intensity ex-
ists here is certainly not aca-
demic, though there may be a
great deal of interpersonal in-
tensity. (I will admit that there
is a fair amount of booking go-
ing on and I am not at all talk-
ing about those people who
haven't emerged from the
stacks for six weeks and have
developed a kind of symbiotic
relationship with their Carrel.
Obviously, these people cannot
make the campus a more ex-
citing place. Fcr a person to
be so fascinated by what he
reads that he can never fear
himself away from it seems to
me to be a contradiction in
terms.)

The only issue-oriented activ-
ity on the campus which
reaches to all members of the
community is the Pterodactyl.
Here I will have to admit that
despite all its sexual hangups
and worn-out New Left verbi-
age, the Pierudaiclyl l5 passion-
ate. Despite all its misdirected
rhetoric about Administration.
Establishment, and other iab-
rlcated targets, it is gmss, free.
opinionated, and sometime:
funny.

I did mention interpersonal
intensity. The serenity of the
physical campus obscures what
seems to be a permanent and
vicious identity crisis in the
lives'oi many students. There
is a great amount of introspec-
tion and discussion of personal
problems here, either in ,one’s
own o‘ique or with one's friend.
But this verballzing of personal
problems seems to go on ad
infinitum ad nauseam. A vici-
ous dynamic develops which
Cannot offer its own solution. I
am certainly not opposed to
talking out problems. Only the
Catholic Church can deny con-
fession. Many times I need to
talk out problems and do so (to
wit, this letterl). But it also

seems that one way to meet
(albeit not solve) an identity
crisis is to get out of oneself,
to turn attention outward. I am
not saying do not take yourself
seriously, but I am saying try
to take your world a little more
seriously. Yours are riot the
only problems that need to be
solved; in solving others’ prob-
lems you unwittingly may solve
a few of your own.

Second, 1 don’t know why the
campus should be so boring. A
son of surface explanation is
the homogeneity and affluence
of the student body, which his
ways makes for a boring come
hination. There are too many
“great kids” here and not
enough “kooks," The lack of
real diversity in the student
body is definitely a contribut-
ing factor. Pardon the pun, but
well-rounded persons are zeros
by definition. The curriculum is
another factor. There is more
room for experimentation, es-
pecially in interdisciplinary
studies. There is no reason why
course offerings cannot be more
issue-oriented, President Leg-
gett’s ideas of relevance not-
withstanding. (e.g., a course on
organ transplants which ex-
plores the biological. legal.
moral, political, and psycho<
logical ramifications, and use:
faculty from appropriate doe
panments.)

Lastly, l hope everyone reads
this letter, but I hope no one
replies. Not that I can’t stand
criticism, it‘s just that this let-
ter is a symptom of the prob-
lem and not a solution. The
sooner we stop talking about
our problems to ourselves, the
more exciting the campus will
become.

Lungan President
Describes Policy

To the Edllon

We feel that we must clarify
the Langan Hall policy on 24
hoiir dorms. As was stated in
last week's sea, our policy is
based on consideration. This
term is often used, but seldom
understood or acted upon in a
mature way. In previous years,
hall officials strictly enforced
or ignored the rule, but did
little further discussion on the
difficulties of donniiory living
particularly concerning the visi-
tation issue, We feel that our
policy is succeeding through
weekly discussions of the prob-
lems of dormitory living, a
weekly dinner series with fac~
ulty members, use of hall funds
for informal social events, floor
meetings, a helpful and honest
resident advisor, and an atmos-
phere of concern for rho indi-
vidual in his relation to the
college community.

We established this policy of
an open dormitory not as an
action of confrontation, but in
the belief that the value of a
college education lies not only
in the classroom, but also out-
side the classroom in the devele
opmcnt of mature, responsible
individuals as they live at col-
legs. The casual social atmos-
phere, which has in part re-
suiied from our policy, is a step
toward developing the individu-

al who makes decisions ol
knowledge and concern rathel
than decisions based on peel
pressure, poor information, DI
facility.

We would be happy to discus:
the living situation in Langal
with anyone.

Schneirov Hearing
Vexes Crosseﬂ

To the Edltol-x

Since Mr, Lawrence Franll
used his power to render ml
silent the other day, I am writ-
ing to the SM; as a way of ha:
ing allowed to express my
view. Mr. Frank, in presiding
over the open hearing on tho
case of Richard Schnelrov’l
massive fornication, apparently,
thinks that the wages paid by
the college to Bliss workers in
pertinent to the case but that
the moral and intellectual chap
actor of the defendant is not.
His ruling was only one sign of
many displayed yesterda,
showing that students are n
at present able to govern them-
selves, Lhough they are able to
insist on their ability.

Now the college boasts n 10-!
ratio of students to Ieachers't
it is necessary, however, to

turn the figure around as welli

Every teacher is outnumbere

by ten to one. And even aftet
you bolster up the teachers‘
ranks by adding those allies of
dubious value, the administra-
tion, the odds are still badly,
against the faculty. What ll
true of Grinncll is even true!
of those large universitiei
where the "irrational revolu-
tion" breaks out first. Quit!
clearly the biological and socio-
logical fact of mere, raw nume
hers is the origin of the pres<
out struggle for power. Mn.
Schneirov justifies his action
solely in these terms: studentl
have the power to make their
own rules and therefore they
have the right. Some 2300 year!
ago Socrates showed two
Greeks, both advocates of rhil
theory that might makes right,
that they were wrong; but truth
is powerless against irrational
power. As Milton said, truth
will always win in a fail- fight,
but Mr. Schneirov and his comp
rades do not, of course, fight
fair.

Let us examine the basic ari-
gument advanced by Mr,
Schneirov and his supportersi]
it runs as follows; the present
law governing open dorms is
unenforceable; it is unenforce-
able because it is being dish
obeyed by a number of peopl.
large enough to make enforce-
ment difficult and even impose
oiblc; therefore the law is illo-
gal. I omit Mr. Schnelmv’s in.
ability to distinmlish between
“illegal" and "unjusi," since i
know what he thinks about law
guage: it is a device invented
by man for concealing his
thoughts, and this brutal and
cynical with is then concealed
in turn by the constant appeal
“Well, you know what 1 mean;‘
which is used whenever any
one tries to find out what is
really meant. Ml'. Schncirov
admitted to me, after tho

(Continued from Page A)

hearing, that neither honesty
nor rational discourse served
his purposes. Well, let’s apply
his theory to cases other than
that of fornication in the halls,

Now daily we read of bank
robberies, car thefts, sexual
crimes against small children.
There are laws prohibiting such
acts —- but by Mr. Schneirov’s
reasoning, these laws are "il-
legal” because the crimes are
committed. We simply do not
succeed either in iorestaliing
crimes nor in apprehending the
criminals after the act, and our
failure is clearly a sign of the
lllegality or our law. One would
think that any 12 year old
child could see through Mr.
Schneirov's argument: but the
Grinnell students who support
ed Miss Bonnie Tinker’s dema-
gogic appeal yesterday — read
in a voice so low that most of
us could not hear it, though
she came through loud and
clear on the request for a
show of hands -— these stu-
dents, I submit, showed that
they lack even the intelligence
or a twelve year old. Sam
Goldwyn seems to have been
right in pegging the national
level of intelligence at that
age.

I have called the Schnelrov-
Tinker appeal for a vote from
the audience demagogic, and I
am willing to support that
term. First, the procedure was
s “hearing,” and a hearing is
not a place for s vote of any
kind. Several years ago Steve
Kent circulated three different
petitions to students, worded
in varying degrees of strength.
Then Kent added all the signa-
tures ,to the most violently
worded petition and claimed a
mandate for his famous sleep-
ln. There was demagoguery,
and dishonest manipulation,
worse than stuffing ballot
boxes. Miss Tinker’s attempt
to initiate mob rule is even
more reprehensible than Kent's
behavior. She held out before
her jury of children the candy;

sweet temptation of power snd
sex; what chance would the
doctor on trial yesterday —- the
faculty — have in a case like
that. For I submit that yester-
day's hearing was not a trial
of Richard Schneirov for forni<
cating but a trial of the faculty
for not teaching. Too many fac-
ulty members are like doctors
who prescribe candy.

Now sex and power are heady
stuii, and students appealed to
in these terms may really think
that they are voting and that
they have and are exercising
poweri What they do not see is
that they are being manipu-
lated. When the dust of the
revolution is over, they will
find that they have a new set
of masters, and one far worse
than the bumbling liberals who
now govem them. Mr. Schneir—
ov has demonstrated, by his
language and actions — the two
means we have for judging
men — that he is not to be
trusted: we find in him that
characteri it: of the liar known
as evasiveness and that charac-
teristic of the coward known as
intellectual dishonesty.

Though I don't think it will
do much good — since Mr.
Schneirov, like Mr, Nixon, is
way ahead in the public opin-
ion polis -— I should like to take
this chance to challenge Mr.
Schneirov, and any of his
friends who care to take part,
to a public dialogue, each party
having equal time to ask ques<
tions which the other must
either answer truthfully or de<
cline to answer.

Let me add that I am writ-
ing this before the court's deci-
sion ls made public. It is quite
clear that the court's decision,
unless it is "not‘guilty," will be
irrelevant, for ML Schneirov
has stated publicly that any
other verdict will be unac-
ceptable to him. The wide sup-
port given his willful dema-
goguery makes the court’s ac-
tion a mockery. Power is in
the saddle; God help the poor
pedestrian truth.

Wallace Ad Defended

To the Editor:

In her letter about why the
5&3 should not have printed
the Wallace ad, Kit Leder
seems to have missed the point
completely. Freedom of speech
is very much the issue on this
question —— the content of the
ad is not our concern.

The ad was prepared by Wa1<
lace people as part of a na-
tionwide advertising campaign
directed at college campuses.
Its purpose, like almost all po~
iitical advertising, was to get
as many votes as possible for
the Candidate, It was Wallace's
decision that this style of ad,
which like most political adver-
tlslng avoided most of the is-
sues, would get the most votes
for Wallace from the college
community. If a college news-
paper chooses to carry any po«
litical advertising, it then has
the obligation to accept all p0<
litical advertisiing. To do other-
wise would be to engage in se-
lective censorship of political
views.

it every newspaper tollowed
its editorial policy in accepting
advertising (many papers in
the South do this in fact) we
would not have seen McCarthy
ads in most papers and we
would not see ads to stop the
bombing of North Vietnam,
sponsored by long lists of col-
lege professors, which regularl-
ly appear in the New York
Times.

One could of course say that
Wallace is a racist, fascist, un-
educated, uncultured slob and
that he doesn't merit serious at-
tention. But that would mean
s line will have to be drawn
between “good" and “bad"
and, as in every censorship
question, this is impossible to
do in the context of freedom
of thought

If there is anywhere in society
that freedom or thought and
action must be defended, it is
on the college campus.

POST
MORTEM

By JOHN GORDLEY

For the interest of anyone
who has not yet been informed,
the first session of a Team of
Four tournament has taken
place in the Forum. In this type
or competition, one partner»
ship sits North-South while
its teammates play the same
hands East-West. Scoring is
done in IMF: (International
Match Points), in which the
number received is based on
the difference in score of a
team and its opponents on
each deal, Thus emphasis is
placed on the discrepancy in
score, as in contract bridge,
rather than on the number of
opponents outscored, as in du-
plicate. Team of Four matches
have the added advantage of
impartiality, because the big
hands held by one partnership
must be defended against by
its teammates.

The following hand was play-
ed in seven clubs, six hearts,
six clubs, and in three no trump
at different tables.

In the club contract, the dis-
tribution in hearts and the po-
sition of the Queen are declar~
er’s only problems. But even it

the Queen and the three are off-v

side, the hand is cold if two
hearts are roiled, setting up
the six and two on the board.

In actual play, seven clubs
was down one on an unneces-
sary spade finesse, six clubs
made seven, six hearts made,
and three no trump made sev-
en. If the grand slam had been
successful, the difference with
the opposing no trump score
would have been 920 points, or
14 IMP'S. The Set gave the op-
ponents a total score of 820
points, or 13 IMP's, a very
costly error swinging Z7 IMP's
between the teams, The other
two slams totaled 1390 in clubs
and 1430 in hearts for a differ-
ence of only one IMP.

The tournament will continue

HAWKEYES OVER UNDERGRADS

GRAY MATTE

By BILL GRAY

What with the World Series
and the football gnmes on Sat-
urday and Sunday and the im~
pending Olympics, it is becom<
ing increasingly easy to sit
around and allow sports activ-
ity to come to us.

It is with pleasure, ihereloro,
that we take note of the I. M.
season as it. moves vigorously
through the bracing iall air and
towards its logical conclusion:
indoor sports and the time when
we Will no longer look like
pmnes when we finish our 1. M.
ICtiVlty’.

I noticed that the Off-Campus
team decided that it lacked
competition from the other halls
and, therefore, played a team
made up of faculty members.
This is a good way to pick up
brownie points provided, of
worse, that you don't win.

Upsets were in the making
last week although calling them
upsets is not really doing them
instice. When some of these
teams win, it makes the part-
ing of Lhe'rRed Sea pale in com
yarison. I was informed, prior
to the Clark game, that the
Read machine was ready to
roll again. it then proceeded to
lose to a team that exhibited

little more than the ability to
field eight men Loose and West
cagily held Dibble to 1130th
victories by forfeiting at half<
time, making the official score
1-0.

East defeated West 13-7 in
the annual Goldfish Bowl thus
giving rise to the question of
whether other bowl games of
yesteryear would continue. For
example, who would gain pos-
session of the coveted toilet
neat when Dibble played Smith
In the Toilet Bowl: would South
again beat North in the Animal
Cracker Bowl; and would Raw-
ion top Langan iii the Finger
Bowl? Only time can answer
these questions, which have
bothered men for centuries.

Of Campus Problem
Hockey Knockers
By CINDY ROOT

For two weeks the girls’ field
hockey team has been rela-
1ively idle (which seems to be
the way most people around
here get in shape) preparing
for the match with Graceland
coming up this weekend. These
two weeks of drills and scrim-
mages (attended by the people
who need them least) have
spotlighted the typical Grin-
neli attitude toward sports
(etc?).

A person who could actually
enjoy working, suffering to im-
prove himself, who could ain-
cerely be interested in helping
others reach this goal with him,
must really be screwed upi
Doesn't he know life is a joke
where you try to get away with
all you can, remembering that
it's a lot easier for one to slip
through a hole in the fence than
two. Why, when you can ration-
alize that getting through the
fence is just a lark anyway,
then you don‘t even have to feel
inadequate or a failure, if you
don't make it through (pretty
safe!)

Well, when half a hockey
team (whoops "interest
group”), won’t give what is
necessary for caring, they are
slowly injecting the poison that
weakens a team. At Grinnell
there is World full of people
who have different feelings about
things from mine; that’s great,
that's exciting, but what are
they doing on the hockey field!

DEFEATED 2-0

The Cornell game, played on
a wet, slippery field, was a fine
team effort, according to Coach
John Hemingway. Grinnell’s fine
conditioning showed up often as
the Pioneers overtook their cp-
ponents from behind.

Bruce Graham scored his
fourth goal of the season, re-
taining the team lead. Tom Lin-
coin came through with his first
goal for the other tally, Tom
and Dave North scored assists
and Dim Ferber, Steve Hirsh-
born, Bill Wedding, and Ken
Labowitz put in very fine per-
formances on the slick field.

Sunday, the Pioneers showed
tremendous stamina and fortl.
tudo as U of l edged them 3-2
in the closing minutes.

The Pioneers bore down from
the start. They worked in two
goals before the half on scores
from Steve Korstad (his sec‘
0nd) and Ken Labuwitz (hll
first). The Hawkeyes fought for
one tally before half.

Iowa battled back, working in
for shots with extremely fine
ball handling. Their biggest
strength was in midfield Nu<
merous times they worked in
for shots, only to be stopped by
fullback: Mike Eaton or Bill
Wedding or by a spectaculiar'der
fensive save by goalie Dave
Coron. Finally in the last 10

'minutes the Pioneers, worn by
nearly 180 minutes of soccer in
two days, were outdistanced as
the Hawkeycs scored a goal to
capture the victory.

Bruce Graham, Dave North,
and Marly Wics also played e
fine gamei Dave picked up his
4th assist to lead the squad

Tomorrow the Pioneers host
Carleton in their final home
stand of the season. Coach
Hemingway expects a tough
game. Carleton is strong on
passing, but he feels his PIDv
neers have consistently shown
fine team work and with mini-
mum injuries and a little rest
they will be ready.

To Lead League

By REGGIE GRAHAM

Ripon grabbed the number
one spot in the conference last
Saturday. Aiter beating the Pio<
neers 41-14, they became the
only team to boast an unde<
tented, untied record. (Cornell
was defeated by Monmouth.)

Considering theso facts (and
adding a bit of optimism), care-
ful analysis of the statistics
show that our team didn’t do
nearly as badly as the final
score indicated. In the first
half, we made nine first downs
to their three. By removing just
three plays (hreakaways for
over seventy yards each), the
rushing and passing yardage
statistics an! equal. of course,
we can’t merely neglect those
three bad defensive plays, but
considering t h e m separately
does help explain why Coach
Bowers called our effort “the
best game we've played.”

The offensive line finally got
going in this game and gave
not only pass protection but also
was able to “fire out" and
open holes for ground yardage
(145 yards). Rey Lewis, Brian
Barnes, and Jon Busweli all
looked good carrying the ball.
Brian played his best game so
for both defensively and offen<
lively, and Jon, as well 54 fi-

nally getting some chances ta
carry the ball, made quite a
few key blocks. Gary Jones did
a good job catching some im.
portant passes for critical first
downs, as well as pulling in a
twenty-seven yard touchdown
pass from Gary Johnson. Tom
Lower, who played n great
game, caught Johnson's other
touchdown pass (seven yards).

The most serious problems
we had all day were the in.
juries (which could also be a
factor tomorrow), The most
popular injury of the day
seemed to center around the
knees—of the five received, Al
Clouds is the most serious. He
will be out for at least a couple
of weeks. There are also rui-
mots of bad referee calls
(mainly led by Steve Hutchings,
who was thrown out before half-
time).

The most encouraging aspeol
of the whole game was that the
Pioneers finally began to work'
together as a team There were
still quite a few mistakes, but
we seem to ba ieaming (we
didn't lose any fumblesl). To~
morrow we play a team the!
has ti record similar to bum
Knox will be tough, but If Iaal
week can be seen as an indica-
tion of progress, we could win
