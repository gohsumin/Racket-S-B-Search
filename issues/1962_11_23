SGA President Boston presents
academic honor plan to senate

By Richard Ohlemeyer
S at B Staff Writer

This week the student senate
meeting consisted of two officers’
reports, Terry ParSSinen, speaker
of the senate, reported that men-
ey from the soda machines which
would ordinarily go into the spe—
cial income fund is being with~
held to pay for broken or unre-

turned soda bottles.

PARSSINEN requested that
students return bottles promptly
and avoid breaking them. Mon-
ey from the special income fund
pays part of the expenses of
Grinnell's ioreign students.

Al Boston, Student Govern-
ment Association president,
presented some ideas for later
consideration. Among these
was a suggestion that a col-
lege-wide academic honor sys-
tem be instituted.

Under the system, all persons

would take an oath to conduct
themselves honorably and prom.
ise not to indulge in any form
of cheating. in addition, persons
taking the oath would assume
the responsibility of seeing that
others do not cheat. Boston men-
tioned that he expected the part
about taking responsibility for
the honesty of others would
meet with more opposition than
the rest oi the system.

ANOTHER IDEA presented by
Boston was a proposal for an
independent symposium entitled
“The Democratic Process in a
Time of Crisis." Such a sympo-
sium could be made up of study
groups trom campus organizes
tions.

The third idea Boston spoke
on was the establishment of a
campus charity fund to contri -
ute to recognized charities which
we do not already contribute to
as a campus.

Gar-rod woke exceedingly early
the next morning, and his heart
was thumping and growling
with such velocity that he could
barely lace up his doublet. He
raced down the winding mala-
chite staircase, and seized upon
Maximilian, who was staidly wa-
tering the potted dalmatian.

“Hey," said the Prince, “is she
up yet? Roxana?"

Maximilian replied that the
Princess had not as yet descend-
ed from the fateful chamber,
and upon accruing this informa—
tion Garrod began fitfully pacing
the palace floor, muttering to
himself and chewing the upper
edge of his undershirt. In this
manner he was soon joined by
his father the King, who paced
and muttered similarly three or
four inches to his rear.

AFTER WHAT seemed an in-
terminable long time, Garrod at
last sighted the hem of his be~
loved's sequined dressing gown,
at the very top of the staircase.
Breathless with consternation, he
stopped dead in his tracks,
whereupon his royal father
crashed into his back and sent
him reeling against the dalma-
tian, causing a nasty hip bruise
and inciting the wrath of the
innocent plant. By the time are
der was restored, Roxena of Tar
valonia stood at the very foot
of the staircase, her raven
tresses glinting in the morning
light. Jeez. thought the Prince.

”l-Iaehow did you sleep, baby?”
asked Garrod, attempting the
while to hide his agitation by
placing his left hand over his
face. The Princess yawned lan-
guidly,

illall at the throng of royalty,
{nobility and servility assembled
,there for her pleasure, she blew
,her nose into a large checkered}
handkerchief produced from her
lcoat pocket, and then addressed’
the company at large.

“So which one is the Prince?"

Immediately after the proper
introductions the great least be-l
gen. and Garrod and Marina,
seated side by side, chattered
gaily and ate and drank with
gusto throughout. Toward the
end of the sumptuous repast, the
young Prince leaned over to the
,v’Princess and whispered to her
lin a sincere toner

"HEY, WHERE’D you get thati
pith helmet?” l i

“Picked it up down the thtol‘e,',
thilly!” she shrieked, poundingl
her knee in delight with one
hand and with the other Squeez-
ling a small syringe, which caus-
'ed a clear stream of seltzer wa-
iter to erupt from the aforemen-
tioned flower in her lapel and
strike the unsuspecting GarrodI
slightly to the left of his nose.
lThat settled it. ’He liked this
'chick.

Upstairs, the faithful Maximil-
ian placed the boiled pea be.
neath the very bottom of the-
eight mattresses. And beneath,
the very top mattress he placed
ten pineapples, a starred marmo—
lset, seven pairs of andirons,
three chamberpots and a hookah,

Righ+s denial

JForce: Braden

By Dim Friedlander
5&8 Staff Writer

Carl Braden, characterized as
a professional revolution-
ary, spoke Tuesday on “The
American Revolution: The Rise
of the Negro in the South.” J

Braden told of the efforﬁ of.
Negro and white integrationist
leaders in the South to Chal-l
lenge a way of life which has.
changed little since the Civill
War. ,
By the denial of the Bill of 1
Rights, particularly the first
amendment, thesauthernnon-
Violent revolution now occur-
ring may be compelled to turn t
toward violence, Braden said. i

The House Un-American AC-l
tivities Committee (HUAC) and
its children, the State UAC’S,
were cited as the main obstacles
to this peaceful revolution.
These committees, Braden said,
in an attempt to divrde the rac-
es, have accused white integrae
tionists of being traitors or Sub-
versives and thus, by their loge
ic, Communists In Mississippi
every integrationist was accus—
ed of being a Communist, he
said.

ln an attempt to negate the
Constitution, Alabama has tried
to pass an injunction barring all
integrationist activities. The logs
ic is that since demonstrations
often are met with white mob
violence they threaten the
“peace and tranquility" of Ala-.
bama, When riots ,erupt the
demonstrators are invariably are
rested instead of the instigators
of the violence.

AN EXAMPLE of violence oc—

curred recently when a state
representative shot and killed a
Negro truck driver who had
participated in a voter registra-l
tion campaign. Not only was
there no prosecution but a
witness was later slugged by a
state trooper and then accused
of assault and fined $25.
It is impossible to attain jus-
tice in the South since the
courts, as well as the mass
media, are controlled by the
owners of the land and indus-
try, They have a vested inter
est in segregation.

BEADEN EXPLAINED that
he believes that 90 per cent of
Southern Negroes are lor in-
tegration and 40 per cent are
militant. About a third of the
Southern whites are fed up
with segregation, only 10 to 15
per cent supporting this policy.

Braden thinks the Kennedy
Administration has been slow
in civil rights action but has
reacted more quickly since
Oxford. But he Stressed the
Administratinn will not move
any faster than the people
demand.

Braden proposed several im-
mediate measures to help inte-
gration in the South. One was
increased federal intervention if
necessary to avoid violence. Ark
other was the abolition of the
HUAC and the Senate Internal
Investigating Sub - Committee,
which, with the Dixiecrats, has

liberalization of the women’s

the horrendous proportions of 3

underlines the decaying moral
ﬁber of this campus.

We are highly suspicions of
the sudden necessity for these
shelves and rugs Obviously,
this is the action of in small,
but vociferous, minority who
believe in free-shelving and
free—rugg'ing. What could these
shelves possibly be used for
if not for books? What type of
lightweight objects does this
vocal minority have in mind?
We fear that this new lihera -
ity in shelves and rugs will
have a stupendous effect on
South campus’ after-hours ac-

We are diametrically opposed
to these uncalled for changes.
After all, if this continues, how

ing to face its ﬁrst opponents,
Monmouth and Cornell, at home

In explaining the situation,
Coach Irv Silnone said, “We
won’t have a swimming team

We'll call it the Barracuda
Club and only the toughest
can get in the club. six men
have earned membership and
we’ll get another at the semes-
ter. We’re going to have fun

in this club."

The swimmers are Jim Adel-
man, Jim Cross, Palmer Hart],
Zal Lefliowitz, Ralph Pray and

Jim Sable, Howard Schein will
become eligible for competition

Cagers preparing for opener

By Phil King
5&3 Staﬁ Writer

The Grinnell basketball team
will open the 1962-63 campaign
next Friday when they journey
to St. Olaf.

Missing from last year’s cham—
pionship aggregation are stand-
outs Bob Musser, George Gray,
Bill Parsons, and co-Captain Ray
Horton. But Coach John Piitsch

boasts a ﬁne group of sopho..

mores in addition to ﬁve return-
ing lettermen. Good height, ex-
cellent shooting and. rebounding,

Brown named

captain, MVP

Grinnell’s ﬁne sophomore dis-
tance runner, Rod Brown, swept

all postseason honors when he,

was voted the most valuable run-
not and captain tor next year
by his teammates.

A durable little plugger, he
paced Coach Dick Young’s Pia
oneers all season, finishing sec-
ond in the Midwest Conference
meet and failing to win a dual
run only once. That time he
was second to a teammate.

His 15:20 in the threeemile
conference go was the best evA
er recorded by a Grinnelljran in
this meet, by some 14 seconds.
He also holds course records at
Carleton and Grinnell.

and fair speed characterize the‘
new version of the Pioneers.

THE VETERANS mentioned
include seniors Gar Smith, Den-
nis Asby and Kent hogerson.
Smith. a 540 senior, has been a
regular for two years and is
the playmaker of the club. Asby
and Rogerson, at 6-3 and 64, are
strong rebounder and accurate
shots. Juniors John Sundell, at
6~7 the tallest man on the team,
and Jim Midlin, 6-3, will pro-
vide much of the scoring punch,
as they did last year.

Other upperclassmen include
seniors Jack Grinin, 6‘1, and
Bob Shepherd, so, and junior
Tony Schroer, 6-2. Eight sopho-
mores round out the squad,
These include Barry Anderson,
6-0, Don McWethy, 5.9, Tom
Buchholtz, 6-1, Clyde Smith, 6-3,
Larry Neal, 673, Randy Morgan,
5‘11, Dick Ulrich, sea, and Dave
Sellergren, 5.10.

Coach Pfitsch admits to be-
ing “very happy with the
whole team" at this stage or
practice. Scrimmages have
been spirited and competition
intense, as everyone has shown
well.

Among the sophomores Pfitsch
lpoints to Buchholtz and Seller—
gran as being the outstanding
candidates for the guard spots
vacated by the graduation of
Parsons and Gray. Clyde Smith
has shown promise in the fore-
court,

 

6:00—12:00

 

Pfitsch expects to, emphasize
versatility again this year, con-
tinuing the plan which brought
the l961-62 team an 13-4 rec-
0rd. Miﬁlin and Asby are capa—
ble of playing nearly anywhere
in the patented Grinnell offense,
and Rogerson and Sundell pro-
vide ample height tor the post
positions.

Piitsch is very enthusiastic
about Miiilin, who is expected
to lead a well—balanced scoring
attack. Each of the ﬁve return—
ing lettermen had averages of
around lo points per game last
year.

The coach points to a genere
al improvement in the confer
ence teams as a major obstacle
to a. second consecutive cham-
pionship, but concedes that
the Pioneers have the potential
and must be ﬁgured as CD-
fnvorites in the running.

 

 

 

 

All,

By Jim Hermg
58:13 Sports Co-editor

The Midwest Collegiate Athletic Conference has put
Life, Look, Sport and the rest of the Official AlleAmez’i-
can football team pickers to shame. Where each of these
magazines might pick a first and second team (22 play-
ers), the MCAC has for its All-Conference selections 61105"
en a first—team offense, 3 first-team defense, a second-
"team offense, a second~team defense and 58 honorable
melltions7102 players in all.

Thus the MCAC has chosen 102 players as the
best in it conference comprised of ten teams which
can only have 110 playels on the field on any time
during the five Saturday afternoon games.

The crystal-ball gazers named three Pioneers to the
starting offensive and three to the top defensive team,
giving Grinnell 27 per cent of the starting teams. They
gave Grinnell 18.2 per cent of the second teams and 17.7
per cent of the first teams, second teams and the honorable
mentions combined. This means 18 out of the 102 named
were from Grinnell.

A mistake has been made. The MCAC is naming every
good player in the Conference (and perhaps a few favon‘te
sons who aren’t even good) instead of naming the best
players. In 2t league of ten teams it’s deep within the realm
of the absurd to name 102 players.

0n the mythical team Denny Asby was named to a
stalting defensive tackle although he played little at that
position during the season. Sophomore Dennis Homer-in
played the defensive tackle spot for the Pioneers during
much of the season.

Beloit, one of the most impotent offensive teams in the
Conference, picked up one starter on the offensive team
iJohn Gomez, a burly tackle. And two Beloit backs, a.
guard, and a tackle received honorable mention as offen»
Sive players. How can stars be chosen from a team which
went nowhere?

Grinnell Sports a sixeman swimming team this year.
This virtually eliminates the team from any chance of
winning dual meets. Half of this year’s varsity consists of
lettelmen, all fine swimmers. The other half is untried on
the varsity level.

The Tact that the once outstanding Grinnell swimming
team is reduced to at six-man squad is Sad. Last year Grin-
nell possibly had its strongest team ever but: lost in the
Conference meet to an even stronger Carleton contingent.
Moreover, Irv Simone, the Grinnell coach, has produced
nine Conference champions in the last 11 years.

Then this year several outstanding swimmers
failed to come out for the sport they excel in. The
backstlloker who finished second in the Conference
last year and first the year before has quit. The finest
all-event swimmer on the team last year has quit. The
swimmer who was named the most improved for two
straight years has quit. The Conference champion div-
er has transferred. A transfer student who dove for
the freshmen last year has quit. Others have quit.

Last year Grinnell slm'mming publicity was filled with
information about three sophomores who were advertised
asefilrinllell's hope for the future. Two of them have re-
tir .

Why do these swimmers no longer wish to compete
on the intercollegiate level? Some say they’re tired of
,swimming. Some say they don't get along with the coach.
‘Some say their grade point suffers when they swim. Some
don’t wish to follow a rigid training schedule; they must
if they wish to swim for Simone.

Are these reasons valid? Do they have to be? I have
no pat answer. No student is under any compulsion to par»
ticipate in anything at Gl‘innell. I am not aiming an ang-ly
blast at the swimmers or the coach. I’m only pointing out
the situation which exists today.
