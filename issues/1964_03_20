Bowen Announcement Illustrates Efficient Work‘
Of Public Relations. Information Service Staffs

“A c om p l e t e emergency
situation that came out of the
woodwork," was the descrip-
tion given this week by Fred
C. Hess, director of college
public relations, concerning
the announcement made last
Friday that President Howard
R. Bowen had just been named
president at the State Univer-
sity of Iowa.

The public relations depart-
ment had been informed at

noon that day that the an-
nouncement of Dr. Bowen's ap-
pointment would be made the
following morning at ll) arm.
simultaneously with the cam-

r *

pus convocation called by the
President.

Hess, along with Mrs. Ruth
Prescott, director of the Infor-
mation Service, were in the
process of briefing their staff
about the weekend news story,
when a call came in from the
bureau chief of United Press
international.

"He said that the announce
ment of Dr. Bowen's appoint-
ment had just‘been made in
Des Moines," Hess said. The
rumor was checked out quick-
ly, and the Grinnell depart-
ment was soon well aware that
the announcement had been
prematurely made.

"For more than three solid

hours not one telephone line in
these offices was open for
three seconds at a time," said
Mrs. Prescott. “The Board of
Regents had apparently decid-
ed in Des Moines that once the
decision concerning SUI’s new
president had been made, they
couldn’t prevent an overnight
leak.”

"Actually, this was SUI’s big
story. They were set to oper-
ate, and we were set to co-oper-
ate," remarked Hess. The early
announcement, h o w e v e r,
caught newspapers, radio and

Integrated Dorms?

The new AWS Board hasn’t wasted any time get
ting involved in campus affairs. They have taken on the
well-worn problem of a south campus integrated dorm
system and are presently aiming at finding some defi»
nite plan to be initiated this spring. (For those of you»
who might confuse integrated dorms with co—ed living,
it should be stated that the system in question involves
only the women. Concern rests with the possibility of
abolishing freshmen dorms and distributing first~year
Grinnell women throughout the quad.)

The latest questionnaire offered to the women
students is pointed at getting the widest selection of
personal opinion — the Board has left itself open to stu-
dent desire — they want to do what the students want

'done. This appears to be the saving grace of both the
questionnaire and any subsequent action that the Board
might take. One of the greatest stumbling blocks in
working with the problem .of integrated dorms has been
trying to find out just what the students want.

' Agreement is widespread on the theoretical value of
integrated dorms. Few see much harm in spreading the
freshmen class out so that their first year contacts are
broadened and deepened. Practically, however, student
opinion is much more divided. Upperclass women are
well aware of the physical limitations that hinder the
integrated dorm idea. The nicest rooms in the quad are
generally found in the upperclass dorms, while the
more limited quarters have been used year after year
for the freshman class. Multiple rooms — triples and
Quads — are also housed in upperclass dorms. Should
the dorm system be integrated, it would be necessary
to put freshmen in the multiple rooms and in many of
the larger doubles and singles. If enrollment is kept
constant, it would also be necessary for upperclass
.women to choose their housing from among the more
crowded quarters along the loggia.

i The questionnaire has already given some indica-
tion that quad women are concerned with the physical
disadvantages of an integrated dorm system: One after
another upperclass student will say that she favors five
or six integrated halls; but that, under such a system,
she would prefer to live in- one of the upperclass dorms.

Thus, the integrated dorm system finds itself faced
with the problem of theoretical vs. practical. The wom-
en are not shutting the door on possible experimenta-
tion, or even a degree of self-sacrifice in order to make
a new system work. They are illustrating the im-

mediate need to deal with the physical problems that
do exist.

The new AWS Board has indicated that physical
problems can be gotten around. Quad opinion seems to
demand that such problems must be worked out simul»
taneous with or before the initiation of an integrated
dorm system. The reality of room drawing dissapoint-
ments should be much more prominent than the theor-
etical advantages of abolishing freshmen dorms. Both
the Dean and the AWS Board should be disturbed by
the fact that the students favor an idea, but don’t really
.Want to commit themselves to live under it.

Peters: lane Boosts Own Career by Defending Oswald

To the Editor:

Recently a part of the Grin-
nell campus has heard a tape
with the speech of a New York
attorney, Mark Lane, on the
guilt of Lee Oswald in the

assassination of the President.
Lane claims the innocence of
Lee Oswald by the means of a
crowd pleaser rather than
those of an attorney at law.

I have heard the address on
the tape by Mark Lane and
read his “Defense Brief” in the
supplement of the weekly news
paper that published his argu-
ments and feel it would be im-
possible to answer all his dis-
tortions of evidence an d
smears in one letter. However.
I give several examples. Mark
Lane states the first murder
weapon that was found was a
German Mauser rifle and that
the police after catching cs.
wald deliberately claimed the
murder Weapon to be an Italian
Carbine just because Oswald
owned and Could be connected
with an Italian Carbine. He
neglects to mention that the
bullets in President Kennedy's
body were of a type that would
be fired by an Italian Carbine.

Mark Lane also presents as
“evidence" that the paraffin

tests registered negativeon
Oswald’s face and therefore
Oswald could not have fired a
rifle. He neglects to point out
that Oswald was able to go
home and change his clothes
before he was apprehended.
During this time Oswald ob-
viously would have tried lo re-
move the gunpowder stains
from his face and hands.
Where did ohe gunpowder
stains on Oswald’s hands come
from? It is clearly established
that Oswald carried a revolver
With him when he Walked away
from his home and that later
Oswald shot and killed a police
officer.

Even Mark Lane does not
really offer any negative argue
ments to the accusation that
Lee Oswald killed patrolman
rippit. Oswald, before he was
killed, admitted that he owned
the revolver that shot rippil.
Lane‘s lame return is that the
person who filed the affidavit
of the murder described the
killer as short, stout, and with
bushy hair. Lane then de-
scribes his Lee Oswald as of
medium height and slender
with wavy hair. For a witness
many yards away from the
scene of the crime, it would he

Patrick Denounces New Policy:
Social Planning Board Usurps
Legislative. Judicial Authority

To the Editor:

It is indeed gratifying to di -
cover that in keeping with Grin-
nell’s tradition of liberalism
and progress there exists here
in an embryonic stage of devel-
opment an organization which
may well revolutionize govern-
mental theory. Its existence
was discovered on or about
February 13, 1564, who the so-
cial Planning Board, an admin
istrafjve agency, advanced into
the legislative realm by out-
lining the legal procedure by
which the open dorms privilege
would be extended to the vari-
ous halls on the Grimell Cam-
pus. The response of SGA re-
minds one of the appeasement
policy of the Allies at Munich,
when, confronted with a fetal
Leviathan, they succumbed
quietly. ‘

But this was merely the be-
ginning. On March 3, 1964, the
Social Planning Board grasp
within its tendrils the Judiciary
Branch of the Student Govern—
ment by defining the court pro-
cedure and legal definitions
necessary for handling open
dorm violations. The entirety of
American political science, for
years naively enslaved by the
apparent advantages of various
federalist models, has no doubt
been stunned by sudden realiza»
tion that here within a com-
paratively closed system is a
living governmental organism
which could quite possibly
completely erase the inefficien-
cy and bureaucratic ponderous-

 

ness of tripartite government.
Having securely grasp the

legislative and judicial branches
of government, it is only a mat»
ter of time before the Social
Planning Board discovers with-
in its mind the fullest outlet for
its dementia praecox, i. e. the
absorption of executive power.
Only then will Grinnell College
realize The New Order.

It is with happy hearts that
we await sublimely the final
consummation of our collective
beings within the magnanimily
of The New Order. Freed of
the necessity of wrestling with
any social or ethical problems
the students will be able to fo-
cus their attentions complete-
ly upon academic pursuits,
basking In the security of en
lightened despotism. Ultimately
we can envision complete iden~
tification between the Board
and the students, so that the
thoughts of eleven become the
thoughts of all.

Although it is true that lhc
Social Planning Board does
have jurisdiction over this so»
cial program, as it is still on a
“trial" basis, it appears that
the Board‘s actions accurate-
ly reflect lwo prevailing aspects
of student-administration con-
flect. First it illustrates a ten-
dency on the part of the admin»
istrauon to avoid direct Con-
fliot With the students and to
deal with them through admin-
istrative agencies. Secondly it
reveals student apathy, a pen
Vasive desire to avoid cnoillct.
Progress and responsibilify not
only involve conflict, but dc»
mand confrontation and com-

 

promise. Robert Patrick

hair of the killer was wavy m-
bushy (it could also be a mat-
ter of semantics), whether he
was of short or medium height
(Oswald looked fairly short la
this letter writer), and wheth<
er the killer was Slender or
stout when he was wearing a
jacket.

Also of grave concern is
What Mark Lane never men—
tioned or rebulted. Oswald was
offered and refused a lie de-
tector test. Oswald was known
to have beat his wife many
times. As a matter of fact,
Marina Oswald once was sep-
arated from her husband be-
cause of this. Also unexplained
is Why Oswald resnsled arrest
and tried to fire his revolver
at Patrolman McDonald when
he was arrested. Neglected too
is Oswald's letter to John Co -
nally, then Secretary of 'he
Navy, promising to revenge
Connally's refusal to reverse
the undesirable discharge of
Oswald from the Marine Corps.

It is hopefully demonstrated
how much some of the facts
have been twisted in the ver-
sion of the killing by Mark
Lane.

It may be that Mark Lane is
not after “justice” or the
“American tradition of juris-
prudence" or any other such
abstraction and really desires
publicity and the applause of
large crowds throughout the
country. His jokes and the
laughter and lhe applause they
aroused could indicate this
possible assertion. Perhaps he
hopes through this case to re-
build the political career lie
had launched earlier and which
for some reason was interrupt-
ed in 1962. However, because
of his conduct in this C1155.
it would not be surprising if he
weze repudiated by the volcrs
for many elections to come.

Daniel Was Faced
With Something?

To the Editor:

“Daniel Prince" of the House
of Woe has just succumbed to
the hideous laughter of the
masses and has died in the

lion's den. The theater-goers
and party-goers have found few
difficulties in toiling his at-
tempt to crash them, and have
now returned for the next act,
only to come back again to
live in their “real" world. Dan<
iel has been dragged into his
dream by the disgusting put—
on intimacy of that lovely
woman of the theater, Annette
duBois. . . dragged onto the
muddy track where he couldn't
see or attain the finality he
thought was in view, He was
trapped with no direction, with
no sympathy, with no love; in
fact, the venerable one who he
thought was his sympathizer,
the one man who had been
able to overcome the world of
triviallty, had tried, only to
be forced into solitary horror.
Bravo, bravo, we shall all be
signed to an unlimited con»
tract, from where we are to

many issues the administration
deserve criticism. Dan’s letter
went far beyond the bounds of
criticism It was an overly
emotional, overly sarcastic
collection of lies and nasty
insinuations. At no time did
Dan support his accusations,
did he even attempt to justify
his position to either the admin-
istration or the student body.
Surely, what he says isn't as
obvious as he seems to imply.
I, for one, fail to see that his
arguments (I use this term for
want of a more appropriate
one) have any grounds whatso-
ever.

Apparently Dan isn't aware
that the SKtB is circulated
among parents, alumni, trus~
tees, and the people who make
grants to the college. Such un-
supported accusations as Dan
makes concerning the use of
money, etc. can not help but
create doubt in the minds of
these individuals. This certain—
1y wouldn’t help the college or
the students.

Following Is the text of Dr.
Bowen's convocation address
given before the Grinnell
student body last Saturday
morning after the announce-
ment had been made that he
would take the position of
president at the State Univer-
sity of Iowa.

I had intended this to be in
the form of an announcement
which I would make to you in
person prior to the public an-
nouncement, The timing of the
public announcement was,
h c we ve r, unexpectedly ad-
vanced, and so the news came
to you by radio, newspaper,
and grapevine,

The first thing I want you to
know is that Mrs. Bowen and I
have a deep sense of regret at
leaving Grinnell. This college
has a way of drawing people
very close to it and of foster-
ing friendships of great value.
I know that you all realize this,
but you will realize it even
more as your time to leave ap—
proaches. Our relations with
the faculty, trustees, and alum<
ni have been and continue to
be most cordial and friendly,
and we have always had a spec-
ial interest and affection for
Grinnell students. This college

dents who are earnest. hard-

 

 

Brown Thanks Robertson for Clarifying
Effect of Gravity on Blood Circulation

To the Editor:

I heartily thank Dr. Rob
ertson for the interest in Yoga
that his letter showed, and,
more importantly, for not let-

ting a mistaken assumption
slip by. I was personally mis-
informed about the role grav-
ity plays in the circulation of
the blood, and this led to some
incorrect conclusion on my
part. I am grateful to Dr. Rob-
ertson for straightening me
out.

It is all too easy to be mis-
informed nbout the exact bene-
fits of specific Hatha Yoga asa-
nas or postures. This is pri-
marily because there is a very
limited scientific knowledge or
understanding of why the Yoga
system is biologically as effec-

tive as it is. I never suffered
under the delusion that the
heart receives a rest in the
headstand position, however,
Yoga is a system of Controlled
exercise, and most of the pos-
tures cause various kinds of
definite stresses on the body
in one way or another. This
is the basis for all purposeful
physical developmentimeas-
ured stress.

Regardless of what is said
about Yoga as a religious,
psychological discipline, Hat<
ha Yoga remains the only com-
plete physical culture system
which offers a concrete path
towards conscious mastery of
the body and its functions, This
is not a Claim, but. a fact with
a 3000 year history.

working, interested in ideas,
and curious,

Grinnell students are {men
getic almost to a fault and col—
lectively they carry on a pro-
gram of activities in discus-
sion, sports, music, drama,
art, student government, jour-
nalism, etc, that is almost un-
paralleled in American educa-
tion. They are incorrigible
idealists. Grinnell students are
interested in the college and
they spend endless hours dis-
cussing it, criticizing it, and re-
forming it. They help make a
lively Campus life where there
is education of the highest or-
der not only in academic pur-
suits, but also in personal char-
acter, human relationships, and
general culture. This is not to
say that you are all/perfect or
that Grinnell could not be im-
proved, But it does suggest
why Mrs. Bowen and I have
enjoyed working and associat-
ing with you, and it also sug~
gests that our leaving is not
due to any negative factor here.
Everyone has been kind, gen-
erous, and tolerant of us, and
we are deeply appreciative.

Looking ahead, I think that
Grinnell has a brilliant future.
It is recognized today through-
out the educational world as
one of the most distinguished
liberal arts colleges of the
United States, You are well
aware of that. But I think there
are many important accom-
plishments ahead, I hops and
expect we shall be able to
carry forward our plans in the
education of Negroes. When I
was in India, and Mr. Barna-
bas here, preliminary arrange-
ments were made for close and
continuing collaboration be.-
tween Ahmednagar College and
Grinnell. In both of these pro-
jects, student participation will
be very important.

Regarding buildings, progress
is still being made. The Forum
Should be ready for use next
fall, and the trustees have just
given the go-ahead on construc-
tion of another science build
ing. Groundbreaking should
occur this summer and the
building should be occupied in
1965. The trustees have also

approved serious study of the
proposal to increase dormitory
space, partly to increase space
for current student body and
partly to achieve a modest in-
crease in enrollment. The tac-
ulty is being further strength-
ened by the appointment of a
few new members this year,
and it will continue to be one
of the outstanding faculties in
the United States.

I look forward also to furth<
er progress in the curriculum.
We have perhaps a problem in
the area of student affairs, but
I believe we have achieved a
period of calm, objectivity, and
good will in which these mat-
ters can be worked out, in a
way that will be reasonable for
students and for the welfare of
the college.

The trustees will be looking
(or a new president without
delay, A group of them will be
meeting on Monday to begin
the selection process, and there
is no doubt of their ability to
make a wise decision, Their
job will be eased by the fact
that the presidency of Grinnell
is a very attractive position,
for the very reasons that it has
been a pleasant one for me and
one that I sincerely regret
leaving. The situation is also
strengthened by the fact that
the college is fortunate to have
a corps of exceptionally able
administrative personnel to
support the new president, .

Having told you how much I
regret leaving Grinnell and
how good Grinnell is, you may
well ask: “Why then are you
leaving?" Without attempting to
plumb the depths of subrcon-
scious motivation, I shall try
to give you the reasons. First,
I should point out that I did not
in any way seek the new posi-
tion, and the fact that I was
under consideration came as a
great surprise to me. The State
University of Iowa is an out;

Never a Dull Moment for Siudenls
Who Donaie Time to Town Children

By Cynthia Brust
From the Infirmary

"Hey, college girl!” she said, taking my hand. "Come here
and look aL this picture. I drew it!” And so I met Barbie, who
was my selfrappointed guide during the first afternoon I spent at
Uncle Sam‘s Club.

It all starts innocently enough. Three or four or five of your
fellow students walk the haltrmile to the building that houses the
Club. You talk about Grinnell on the way — house president elec-
tions, hourlies, concerts. Then you open la door — and it’s a dif-
ferent world” A juke box blares Beatle songs, ten boys Wrestle
en masse, almost everyone runs, jumps, or dances, and everyone
shouts.

“We like to do stuff," they told me when I asked them why
they come. Sixryearbld Theresa told me that; so did 12-year-old
Sharry. There most certainly were things to do. The house and
yard contain playground equipment, ping-pong and pool tables,
punching bag and dart board — all donated by Grinnell business- .
men or purchased with United Fund money. Each session fea-
tures a planned craft and an organized game or two for those
who want it. And constantly, in the background (or foreground)
are the sounds of the jukebox and the wrestling boys. “You just
walk in and they ask you to wrestle,” an ”oldrtimer” told a col-
lege boy going for the first time. You won't have to worry about
linding something to do!"

Why do they do it? Why do over 85 students a semester da~
nate an afternoon or evening once every other week to playing
with a roomful of Children? I spent five hours there trying to find
out and I think I know. Jerri Linn Hart told me she goes. "be-
cause I like to work with the little kids." Evie Corsini said, "It’s
a completely different world, and the work is rewarding. Peggy
Gerber admitted that her evenings with the fifth and sixth

graders are exhausting, but says, “They've taught me to relax
(The boys present were occupied as referees. bells for signalling
the end of boxing rounds, and sparring partners — all were very
unavailable for comment!)

Evelyn Corsini and Don Bogue are this year’s COrChail'men
of the Uncle Sam’s Club program. Sessions are from 3:30 to 5:00
each alterncon except Frlday for approximately 135 youngsters
four to nine years old. Tuesdays from 7-9 pm, the fifth and sixth
graders meet; there are about 55 of them. Ninety junior high stu-
dents meet on Wednesdays, Each of these sessions has a college
group leader, who is in charge of the activities, Leaders this se-
mester are Jerri Linn Hart, Tom Karger, Ruth Koehler, Ann
Klein, Bing Johnson and Judy Roberts.

This year‘s group has also revived the Monday meetings of
the high school group, with Milt Tocue as group leader. The as
teenagers involved have elected their own officers and plan their
own monthly parties. Their current project is a “kiddie party,”
complete with costumes and ”birthdayrparty games."

Uncle Sam’s Cluh has always been a pet college project. The
club was founded in 1902 by two college boys, members of the
class of 1903i It is now run with United Fund backing. There is
only one salaried employee, Mrs. Robert Thomazin, who has
been director for 14 years. Policy decisions are made by a gov-
erning board which meets once a week. The board includes the
college Chairmen, Mrs. Thomazin, and businessmen, teachers,
and ministers mm the town, A women's group, the Happy Help-
ing Hands, has been formed this year to help in the work oi the
club,

“Lots of kids think that the club is silly, that we don’t ac-
complish anything,” Evie remarked. “That isn‘t true. Uncle
Sam’s Club is an important part of the town of Grinnell and the
townspeople feel that it’s really their club We have kids who
come from all over town, just because their parents came, and
even their grandparents This is the most practical community
service a Gl‘innell college student can give — and the most fun."

Bogue added that many college guys seem to think that this
is a girl’s project. “It's not," he said emphatically. "We always
need more guys,,especially for the older groups. These kids need
guys they can look up to, and who will play and talk to them.
You really feel as it you’re doing something worthwhile."

IRC Gathering. Seminar on Order
Share Political Scientist Friedrich

By Ann Showalter

The Order-Chaos lecture se-
ties and the International Re-
lations Club
both benefited
irom the visit
Carl Jr Frieda
rich (political
s c i e n c e) of
Harvard and
the University
of Heidelberg.

Lecturing on
“The Dialectic
of Order and
F re a d o m in
Politics" Fri- FRIEBRIC"
day evening in Herrick Chapel,
Friedrich diSCussed the free-
dom of individuals and nations
in relations to the political or-
der.

“Man wants a free order and
he wants an ordered freedom:
therefore, he must accept dis-
order and unfreedom to a cer-
tain extent," he stated, .

He stressed the “continual
dialogue' going on between the
terms “order’ and “freedom."
The conflicts implicit in these
two words are of the essence
of politics in a democracy.

Whether more freedom or
more order will occur in a
given situation depends on the
individuals involved and the
circumstances, but in general,
Friedrich b e l i e V e s, ”The
stronger the man, the more
yalue freedom; the weaker the
man, the more Value orderf”

Since different people re-
quire different amounts of
freedom, one of the problems
in the ordering of a commun-
ity is “to provide the minimum
of freedom for those who want
only a minimum and at the
same time to allow those who
want more freedom to have
it.”

Friedrich cited professors
and students as examples of
people who might require more
freedom than is sometimes af-
fordecl by the political order.

People seek three different
types of freedom. The first is
freedom of independence or
lack of governmental interfer-
ence, The founders of America
were seeking this type of free-
dom. The desire for the second
type of‘freedom, freedom to
participate in one’s govern
ment, has become apparent in
the fight for civil liberties

“Freedom of 'creafion has
become important in recent
years,” said Friedrich. People
desiring this type of freedom
are not trying to keepithe gov»
ernment out of their affairs or
trying to participate in governs
ing themselves; they want the
government to help them in
selfedevelopment through an
Order that Will provide for eds
ucation, employment and
peace.

Since political order must
provide for so many types of
freedom," “Any dynamic or-
der is characterized by emerg-
ing disorder.”

The freedom of a nation may
conflict with the freedom of
the indi duals within it. Thus,
newly independent countries
are sometimes criticized for

 

suspending individual free<

doms.

The mother country may say
the people were freer under
her domuu‘on, The new nation,
however, replies that estab-
lished countries often suspend
individual rights in times of
crises and by this principle the
recently freed nation may with-
draw rights. »

A country thus has the free-
dom to order its Own affairs
even if by doing so it limits
the freedom of the people with.
in it.

In his IECture to the lRC Con-
ference Saturday morning on
“National Interests and World
Government.” Fredrich ex-
plained that ”national inter-
est” is defined differently by
three different groups.

The political technicians in
the State Department conceive
of national interest as main-
taining the position of the Unita
ed States in the World.

The various. specialeinterest
groups representing large or»
ganizations think national in-
terest coincides with their par-
ticular points of View. “For-
eign policy on many issues
emerges as a compromise co-
determined by the various
special-interest groups and the
technicians in the State De,
partment."

The third group the general
public, rarely comes into oper-
ation in formulating foreign
policy, but when it does, as
in the Cuban crisis. its effects
can be devastating.

”Though the public believes
national interest to be in pre-
serving peace and freedom, it
has often stepped in to demand
warlike action," Friedrich stat-
ed.

Taking into account all these
conceptions of national inter-
est, Friedrich considered the
United Nations and regional
groups of nations in relation to
world government. He believes
the UN, European reunification
and the Organization of Ameri-
can States have generally been
advantageous to the United
States.

"If the UN is a precursor to
world government, it is much
closer to the American ideal of
federation than to the Commu-
nist dream of world domina-
tion." He thinks reorganization

of tile UN would go against Us; operates with nations as its

national interests because “the
push for reorganization comes
from countries with ideologies
different from ours."

“Our only hope for world or-
der is likely to come in terms
of about a dozen homogeneous

Main Foyer Hosts
Senior Ari Exhiliit
0f Various Works

The new exhibit gracing the
walls of Main foyer is the work
of Grinnell's own talent: the
senior art majors. it is hoped
the Senior Art Exhibit will be-
come an annual activity of the
art department, analogous to
the senior recital given by niu-
sic majors.

Each senior art student
chooses several examples from
his class or independent work
of the last few years, and from
these were selected the pieces
which make up the exhibit.

The works represent almost
all the media and techniques
available to the art student
through the art department:
oils, water colors, prints, ce-
ramics, and silver. There is an
equal variety of styles, and
diverse subjects, ranging from
“Weed" to “Madgalene.” The
most unusual title belongs to a
painting by Judy A. Johnson,
“That which I should have
done I did." The ceramics and
jewelry are the work of Carl
Rattnerf

The art majors are gaining
practical experience by setting
up the exhibit themselves, un-
der the supervision of Mn and
Mrs. Louis Zirkle, art instructa
ors. They matted, framed and
labeled their own pictures,
then arranged them according
to color, style, and medium,
to the advantage of the room,
the lighting and each otherf
They used colored strips of
burlap to unify and organize
the display.

The purpose of the exhibit.
on display from March 7-29, is
to spotlight the work of senior
art majors. This exhibit is one
of ﬂiree ways in which student
work is presented to the stu-
dent public during the year.
The student exhibit, scheduled
for April. 30-May 18, in Scllaef—
fer Gallery, provides an oppor-
tunity for any student to dis-
play his art work, and the stu-
dent sale is held later in the
spring for all students who
wish to sell their work.

cultural entities." He named
India, China, Africa, Europe,
Arabia, Latin America, Great
Britain, the US and USSR as
logical groupings, "rather than
all the ones we have now."
Since international law still

primary grouping and since
the democratic and totalitar-
ian conception of law differs
SO radically, Friedrich feels
that any attempt at world gov-

Bishop Depicts Pascal's Genius
For Phi Beie Chapel Lecture

The description of a “vivida

and unmistakable phenomenon

of genius“ was

presented at

l a s t Friday‘s

Phi Beta Kap-

pa chapel lec-

t u r e. Morris

Bishop, 1) o e t,

b io g r a pher,

and humorist,

spoke to the 24

new initiates of

the honor soci»

ety and other

“SHOP students and

faculty. He described Blaise

Pascal, the subject of his lec-

ture as the most “authentic
case of genius."

Bishop described Pascal‘s
boyhood and education care-
fully, calling his life a ”pathet-
ic picture of a great mind try-
ing to destroy itself.” He por-
trayed a boy and man with a
restless and unquiet mind that
could never be satisfied With
what others were satisfied
with. . ,"

‘;The quest for certitude”
was the driving force of Pas-
cal’s life, according to Bishopf
The contradictions in this and
in his goal to prove Christian
faith by the power of reason—
are reflected in Pascal’s work,
the Pensees. A scientific and
mathematical prodigy, he is
quoted as saying, “Our only
true science is comprehension
of God's will and obedience to
if.” He also stated that “Faith
is God felt in the heart, not
in the reason."

Given to mysticism, Pascal
included the statement, “I know
the one in whom I have be-
lieved,” on his official seal.
Bishop characterized him as a
man who "tried force of will
to achieve saint-hood. He tried
to abandon man. , , . he could
never escape from his mind,
from that old demon thought"

In conclusion Bishop printed
out the role Pascal‘s upbring-
ing played in his genius He
pointed out that the “informal”
education Pascal received de-
veloped his reason and judg~
ment and encouraged original-
ity. Yet he lacked the sense of

discipline and conformity which
a formal education brings.
“Schools prepare us for liv-
ing in the world," he Said. flu
immediately pointed out, how-
ever, that “group adjustment
will destroy a genius' he must
learn group rejection. . . .
Genius, like all creativity, must
be paid for.” Listing peace of
mind, happiness, comfort, ad
solidarity as the things lost,
Bishop concluded that “the
genius has no choice."

Anku Presents Series of Articles
Discussing Nkrumah's Government

This is the first of a series
of articles written by Vincent
Anku, Grinnell junior, on the
problems of Ghana,

In recent months, as Ghana-
ian politics has become in-
creasingly prominent in the
American press, many unjust
and groundless statements
have been made against her
government through American
news services. My complaint is
that these statements do not
tell the whole truth. In a series
of weekly articles, I shall at-
tempt to present the other face
of Ghana government headed
by President Kwame Nkrumoh.
In the first four articles I shall
make general statements which
will be fully discussed and the
evidence for them offered in
later articles.

It is one thing to report that
Nkrumah dismissed Ghana's
Chief Justice, Sir A. Korsa, and
then to add wild comments
such as “it is a trend towards
absolute dictatorship.” But it
is another thing to give a fair-
ly comprehensive account of
what actually happened, what
the other cabinet ministers said
about it, and how Ghanaians
reacted to the Chief Justice.
Five people were tried for an
attempt to assassinate Nkru-
man. The three top cabinet
ministers who master-minded
the plan were acquitted while
one poor civil servant and an
opposition party member were
convicted,

Unbiased papers like the
New York Times pointed out
that the verdict acquitting the
alleged conspirators drew heat-
ed criticism in the press and
protests from various parts of
the country. Ghana's Attorney
General Kwan Swanzy stated
that the court's decision sav-
ored of “discrimination" and
that the two rulings were in
compatible He continued that
it would have been better to ac-
quit all five accused or to con-
vict the whole lot. The Times
also reported that thousands of
people demonstrated in Gha-
na’s capital, Accra, demanding
the dismissal of the Chief Jus-
tice. Thus, Dr. Nkrumah did
not arbitrarily fire the Chief
Justice, The National Assembly
authorized him to do so, and
elements desired the action as
well. The Times later reported
that the commission oi jurists
urgently petitioned the Presi-
dent to reinstate the Chief Jus-
(ice. Ghanaians are quite free
either to endorse or protest in
public or through the Party
about policies and actions
Nkrumah takes.

The Des Moines Register re-
ported the dismissal, but it
failed to give background and
labeled Nkrumah outright as a
"left-leaning dictator." This
kind of iallacious reporting
does not hurt Ghana much. It
certainly intensifies the Amer.
ican people's apprehension and
prevents them from taking ad
vantage of the unprecedented
investment opportunities avails
able in Ghana. in spite of num~
erous hostile remarks and
practically undeclared war on

Ghana by certain sectors of
the American press, more and
more foreign aid and private
capital irom the West is pour-
ing into the country each
month, However, I think pa-
pers like the Des Moines Reg~
ister and magazines like Time
are misinforming r e a d e r 5
about Ghana. The real harm
is to the American readers
who genuinely want to under-
stand Ghana.

Nkrumah’s party policies are
not mere propaganda slogans,
but are truly based on 'prin—
ciples of peace, prosperity, and
progress. This is very well
summarized by Nkrumah in
his recent message to the na~
tion concerning the Seven-
Year Development Plan (1963-
1970):

"The Plan provides the blue-
print for the iuture programs
and development of Ghana as
a nation. It is a program of
social and economic develop-
based on the use of science and
technology to revolutionize our
agriculture andgindustry, It is
designed to provide the basis
not only of our national pro-
gress and prosperity, but also
of our ability to contribute to
the advancement of the African
continent.

“Our aim is to establish in

Ghana a strong and progres-
sive society in which no one
will have any anxiety about
the basic needs of life, about
work, food, and shelter; where
poverty and illiteracy no long-
er exist and disease is brought
under control; and where our
educational facilities provide
all the children of Ghana with
the best possible opportunities
for the development of their po-
tentialities.” (The New York
Times, January 20, 1964, page
67.)
«Nkrumah has done a great
deal toward achieving this
goal. 1 shall deal with his ac-
complishments of the past ten
years and his plans for the next
seven in later articles. If this
is what some Americans call a
“trend toward communism,"
this brand of ”Communism” is
a great hope for Ghanaians.
For it is under this type of gov-
ernment that Ghana has to-
day achieved the highest living
standard of any of the new Alrir
can nations. But the govern—
ment and the people are not
content with this; they are de-
termined to develop fully the
human and material resources
of their country. This means
substantial economic develop-
ment, Like all newly independ-
ent nations, Ghana intends to
achieve this as quickly as pos-
sible.

and they all turned to Grin-
hell.

The public relations staff,
Alan (Mickey) Holmes, Mrs.
Jane Renaud and Mrs. Helen
Wiesc began to act. Biographt
cal material on both Dr. and
Mrs. Bowen and their lamily
was dispensed to all news
areas, phone calls went out to
traveling Grinnell representa-
tives, plans were set for an
afternoon press conference and
press packets were prepared
for reporters.

Sophomore Ted Steele, who
happened to be working in the
office that afternoon, also got
in on the excitement. “When
the phones didn't work, his
legs did.” remarked Mrs.
Prescott.

Meanwhile, President Bowen,
whose plans had also been
pushed ahead by the early anA
nouncement, had gone into se-
clusion to finish preparing his
public statement. Original plans
had called for a meeting Fri-
day afternoon at which the
president would inform facul-
ty members of his new posi-
tion. Now the state pressmen
were clamoring to meet with
the President at that confer-
ence. Because Dr. Bowen de-
sired to keep his faculty meet-
ing just withiaculty members,
the public relations depart-
ment began making plans for
an afternoon press conference,

“We had to make ‘dozens of
calls to inform all interested
agencies that the President
would meet the press at 4:30
in Burling Basement. We even
made about 12 calls trying to
locate the 58:3 editor in a fu-
tile attempt to get the news
break in last week's Friday ed-
ition of the paper," said Mrs.
Prescott. (The SH; had al-
ready gone to press three
hours before and the editor was
sitting in an afternoon seminar
learning how to teach English
grammar to tenth graders.)

By 4:15 most of the pieces
were beginning to fall into
place. SAGA had been notified,
and had sent over donuts. cof~
fee, and ice water for the press
conference. Press kits includ-
ing pictures, biographical ma-
terial, information about the

Chairs and tables had been
gathered from neighboring ot-
fices and moved into the view-
ing room. And the phones were
still ringing off the hooks.

One of the biggest boosts
came from Wellhouse photog
raphy studios here in Grinnell.
With negatives of the Bowen
family on file they set to Work
about two that afternoon and
had dozens of prints to the col-
lege by four. They also took
pictures at the press confer-
ence.

Grinnell students working as
interns in Des Moines for the
national wire services were
also swept into the “big story."
Dave Baetz was sitting in on
the meeting of the Board of Re-
gents when the announcement
was made, Both he and Jim
Herzog were kept busy prepar<
ing material for the service and
for the college.

impromptu,” said Hess con-
cerning the work of the public
relations department. “I am
very proud of the way the peo-
ple in this office geared them-
selves and went to work after
only a five-minute briefing."

“This event also illustrates
the efficiency of the American
press," he continued, Despite
the rush, and the short notices,
the stories were complete and
accurate and well written. The
material contained in them was
a credit to Dr. Bowen and to
Grinnell. It shows how the
media can react to an emer-
gency situation it they have
to.”

By 8:15 the last reporter had
taken his story to the printers.
That night. some of the staff
returned to the office to work
on special material for Iowa

Schuman Pleased
By ‘Dnnie! Prince'

By Sam Schuman

Last week’s production of
Daniel Prince, an original play
Written and directed by Keith
Felton, was an extremely
Worthwhile experiment. Mr.
Felton gave us a work which
shows surprising promise and
an even more surprising lack
of those faults which usually
accompany the works of a be
ginning dramatist. The play
was not flawless: much of the
second scene could have been
expressed in action and not
talk; at times the major
themes of the play were pushed
at Che audience a little bit too
hard; and at times. Mr. Fel-
ton's attempts. both as a writ-
er and as a director, at symbol<
ism and theatricalism were a
bit overdone. But as these criti-
cnsms could probably be equal-
1y leveled at Arthur Miller
(After the Fall) and George
Bernard Shaw (Major Bar-
bara), Mr. Felton need not teel
that he is in bad company, Mr.
Felton seemed particularly apt
at creating the comic line, (“I
was born under the sign of
Scorpio, what about you, sir?")
"I was born under Duress,
Madame" and the dialogue was
generally quite good.

The production or this piece
was also quite interesting.

once or twice, to make the
transition between the two a lit~

slight unnecessary abruptness
in changing from mood to
mood. Ken Friedman demon-
strated his growing ability as

Emily llorne Gives Glimpse of life in Thailand Villages

Emily Home is currently a
Fifth Year Student teaching
and studying abroad in Thai-
land as part of the Travel-
Service scholarship program.

Fifteen houses, w oo d e n
floored and sided with bamboo
matting, huddled together in an
unkempt clearing slashed out

of the lush greenness. Sharp—
spined hogs rooted and wal-
lowed beneath the pole»perched
h o u s e s; ragged - feathered
chickens pecked among the
refuse. At the approach of the
Church - employed Buddhist
nurse and myself, mangy dogs
tugged at their ropes and burst
into defiant yapping. A turban-
headed Woman quieted her dog
and motioned for us to climb
up. Her baby was ill, and in
the single room behind, anoth-
er child slept beside the cook
fire and the simple utensils.

We were in a Karen village.
This particular village is a
mere 70 kilometers from
Chiengmai (the second-largest
city in Thailand), but the trip
there took from sunrise to sun»
set in a power-wagon. And this
was during the dry season.
During the rainy season, any-
one needing to go to Chiengmai
for emergency medical treat
ment would have to walk, or
he carried for two days. The
road is never more than a red
clay gash in the mountainside;
the torrential rains and creep-
ing vegetation conspire to ob
literate it.

The Karens, who altogether
number between 60,000 and 90,-
000, are said to be the largest

PPPE Picks Book
For April and May

Convention, a novel about a
national political convention,
by Fletcher Knebel and Charles
Bailey, (Seven Days in May),
has been selected by the Pro
gram In Practical Political Ed-
ucation as the April-May Polit-
ical Book-of-the-Month.

The story of a six»day battle
for the Republican nomination
for President in a mythical
convention in Chicago, the
novel has been chosen in part
for its connection with the
Mock Convention coming up in
April.

In the story, Charles Man-
chester, convention front-run-
ner, announces at a prercoven-
tio press conference that, if
elected, he will review, and per»
haps cancel, a $10 billion mis-
sile contract. The resulting re-
percussions of this statement
among major pressure groups
change from an apparent shoo-
in for Manchester to a real
cliff-hanger, not decided until
the final roll-call of the states.

“in this book one can actual-
ly feel the atmosphere of a hot,
steaming political convention,
With the screaming, banner-
waving mobs of delegates, with
frantic candidates and ulcer-
ous managers, with blaring
hands and bright klieg lights,
with irreverant reporters, and
the like,” said C. Edwin Gil-
mour, PPE Director.

 

of the hill tribes in Thailand,
They are one of twenty groups,
all of which are ethnically and
racially different from the Thai.

Like most of the other hill
tribes, the Karens practice dry
agriculture (rather than the
Wet method of the Thai, with
irrigation and ﬂooding of the
fields). They clear the fields
by cutting and burning the un-
derbrush, the only fertilizer
being the ashes of the burned
plants. Like most of the other
hill tribes, they live at eleva~
tions between 2,000 and 7,000
feet, they are not literate, they
speak little or no northern
Thai, and they are predomi-
nately animistic rather than
Buddhist.

The Karena, however, are
unlike the other groups in that
many of them are Christian.
Missionaries were astounded
to find Christian Karena in
Thailand, for until the last 15
years, there were no mission-
aries working with them. This
peculiar situation is explained
by the fact that for over 100
years, Karens in Burma have
been Christian, and Karens in
Thailand have been mission-
ized by their own Burmese
brethren.

A great variation in econom<
ic complexity is evident among
the hill tribes, from those who
practice efficient agriculture
and produce profitable surplus-
es, to the primitive Phi Tong
Luang, or “Spirits of the Yel-
low Leaf.” The “Spirits," of
whom there are probably not
more than 100, are nomadic
hunters and gatherers whose
only extra -group commerce
has been with nearby Meo pe0<
pie. Until recently, when Thais
first saw the “Spirits," reports
of these people were disregard-
ed as imaginary. The men of
this group wear only a loin
cloth; their houses consist of
nothing more than a windbreak
of banana leaves against a tree
trunk, where a fire is kept
burning all night for warmth.

Great variation, too, is found

in the degree of assimilationlvisited, for example, had signed

into Thai culture among these
different hill tribes. The “Spir-
its," rather than being assimil-
ated, are slowly becoming ex»
tinct, as their hunting grounds
are encroached on by farmers
and mining concerns. The
Lawa, the group predominat-
ing in Thailand at the time the
Thai began filtering into plain
and valley regions from south-
ern China during the 9th Cenr
tury, have in many cases be-
come indistinguishable from
the northern Thai. Many speak
Northern Thai rather than
Lawa, and practice wet culti-
vation. Particularly around
Chlengmai this is true,

Many Karens live in close
proximity to the Thai, and
work for the Thai in the teak
forests or tin mines. Many are
aware of being citizens of a
large political unit. Yet they
strongly resist assimilation,
jealously maintaining their own
distinctive dress, their customs
and language.

Assimilation is not aided by
the practices of the Thai to-
ward the Karens and other
such groups. Although the laws
on the books are fair, the atti-
tudes toward and dealings with
them often serve to heighten
group cohesiveness. .

Most Thais seem to think of
the hill tribe people as infer-
ior beings. One girl’s response,
when she heard I was going to
visit a Karen village, was,
”Catch me a Karen.” On other
occasions, I have heard my
students taunt each other with
tribal designations, chanting,
“She is a Lawa” over and over.
When I once asked whether the
hill people were Thai, the ab-
surdity of the question brought
forth gales of laughter. These
people, apparently, may be
Thai in Citizenship, but are not
“Thai" in any other respect.

Because they are ignorant of
their rights and few of them
speak. Thai, the hill tribers
are often Cheated by the Thai.

fact that acting is a solemn and

their parts with a lighthearted

In summary, Daniel Prince,
both as a piece of dramatic

The "Students for Scranton”
committee has released a state-

cording to the Scranton com—

away their paddy fields to a
mining company at great loss,
understanding only imperfect-
ly at the time what they were
doing. Now thick mud com-
posed of worthless subsoil has
completely covered their hold-
ings, and they are forced to
farm less desirable ground.
The Karens of this area rely
on the Karenrspeaking Ameri-
can Baptist missionaries to help
mediate their problems, but as
foreigners. the missionaries can
not get very involved in politi-
cal matters without endanger-
ing their residence permits.
Nevertheless, the missionaries
have been successful in estab-
lishing a school at Bewe Gew,
the government supplies the
teacher, and the mission sup-
plies tha salary.

Compulsory primary educa
tion has had the effect of slight-
ly blurring ethnic distinctions
and divisions in the case of the
large Chinese minority, but the
benefits of the program (imple-
mented with ﬁle affluent Chi-
nese in mind) have not spread
to most hill tribes. The almost
complete absence of schools
in remote areas, and the regu-
lation that school must he
taught in Thai rather than in
the groups’ own language,
have retarded the process.

The government is slowly
beginning to follow the excelv
lent lead of the missionaries in
helping in sanitation, agricul»
tural methods, and education.
But the government’s efforts
have been minimal. One espec~
ially pressing problem is that
of the Meo’s livelihood, now
that opium growing has been
outlawed. Another is that With
dieir numbers expanding and
their slash-and-burn agriculture
supporting only small popula-
tions, the hill tribers are being
forced down into the Valleys
and into a culture in which
they are unprepared to live.

What little effort the govern-

 

ment has made for the hill
tribes has been prompted by
the knowledge that their well-
being may have an effect on
Thailand’s future. The West in
Burma, the Karens are in-
volved in sporadic flarerups
with the government over the
Shah states. in neighboring
Laos, the Meo are-the best
guerrilla fighters for the Comv
munists. And Communist prop<
aganda, thus far ineffectual,
has been directed toward the
Meos and Yaos of Thailand’s
northeast. ‘

The loyalty of the hill tribes,
if the Communist threat ever
develops into an offensive here,
could be decisive. They have
thorough knowledge of the
mountainous border terrain,
and are the best source of in-
formation a b o u t activities
there, Their inaccessibility,
linguistic differences, and es»
trangement from Thai culture
remain formidable odds to ov-
ercome.

Mile-Relay Team
Eyes 3:125 Time

Goals are set to be met and
Grinnell College's crack mile-
relay.quartet has every inten»
tion of meeting the standards
they have marked down for
themselves.

Before the season started.
tine allrjunior team — Ron
Schachel, Jeri Langliam, John
TePaske and Bruce Beckord—
got together and decided they
would hit 3:125 in the event.

“The talent is therE," says

Coach Dick Young. “And I
wouldn’t be too surprised to
Ice them do even better than
that if they are all clicking at
once. We perform well at the
Drake Relays—maybe it will
be there.”

Even though handicapped to
some extent because of poor
indoor trainingdacilities, this
crew has already set one new
record~a 3226.4 in the Chica-
gorMidwest Conference meet
last weekend.

This, however, is not the best
time logged by the four. in
trials for the Chicago Daily
News Relays they turned in a
3: 4.8. Running for the first
time on the boards, the quartet
won its mile-relay division
with a 3:25.11.

The record 3126.4 does not
seem too Spectacular by itself;
but take a look at what the four
did during the three hours
prior to the race, Schachel, the
leadoff man, ran in three 6|)-
yard dashes and three 60-yard
low-hurdle races. Then he
pushed out two 2le legs and a
440.

Langharn was warming up
for his contribution by clipping
off two 880’s. TePaske opened
the afternoon’s work by com-
peting in the broad jump. From
the pit, he ran a pair of 220’s
and an 880.

Meanwhile, Beckord was not
loafing. Before the feature
event’s call, he tackled three
SOsyard dashES, two 220 sprints,
and an 880. The mile relay was
his seventh race of the day!

To meet that 3:115 goal,
Young figures Schachel will
have to run a :435 out of the
blocks, with both Langham
and TePaske following with
ids’s. If they do this, Beckord
needs just a :47. but Young
thinks he is capable of going
lower than that With a run-
ning start.

This mile mark isn't the only
goal these four have set for
themselves as a relay unit. if
they can cut their times to
meet a 3:211 standard in the
sprint medley, they‘ll be hap-
PY-

To do this, Beckord needs a
:47.5 quarter, while Schachel
and TePaske get :2l.8's in their
220’s. That leaves Langham,
who seems to be the most at
home in the 880, With the re-
sponsibility of going at least
1:52 in his specialty.

“Actually, this goal doesn’t
seem as far out of reach as
the mile standard.” says
Young. “These fellows have all
had times close to these break-
downs, but never at the Same
time.

”One of these days they are
going to click and there will
be one happy relay quartet and

 

one very pleased coach.”

I'hinclads Win at North Central
Rod Brown Takes Two Firsts

The Grinnell cindermen swept
to a victory in the North Cen-
tral Relays in Naperville, out-
distancing host North Central
by 9 points, ending up with a
total of 49 markers. This was
the first Naperville victory by
the Pioneer thinclads, having
finished third and second in
two previous years.

Grinnell's victory was due to
their fine effort in the relays
and the individual distance
events. Ron Schachel, Jeri
Langham, John TePaske, and
Bruce Beckord won the 12 lap
relay and finished second in
the eight lap, with times of
4:013 and 231.4, respectively.

The 20 lap team also tri-
umphed, with John Teising, Te-
paske, Langham and Beckord
covering the distance in 7:32.55.

Rod Brown repeated his feat
of last year, Winning the mile
and 2—mile with times of 4:38.6
and 9153.1.

Coach Young singled out Jim
Miller, sophomore shotputter,
who came within one inch of
the school record, tossing the
shot 48'4” and Mike Dewitt,
who improved greatly to finish
third and fifth in the high and
low hurdles, Young also pointed
out the inconsistency of his
jumpers and Grinnell's weak-
ness in the sprints.

Looking to the future, Coach

Young noted that the Pioneers
would be strengthened with the
addition of pole-vaulter Clyde

Record Book

The individual and team sec-
tions of the Grinnell College
basketball record book were re-
written with reckless abandon
this year as 14_marks fell and
another was tied,

Even though Coach John
Piitsch's outfit could finish no
better than fifth in the Midwest
Conference with a 9-9 mark, it
still established seven new team
standards for a season, includ-
ing field goals (703), points
(1.739), and rebounds (1,184)

“We outshot, outrebmmd-
ed, and outscored our oppo-
nents on the season," Pﬁtsch
noted. “Yet we won only 12
or our 22 games. This just
points out the fallacy of statis-
ticsl”

This was the hard-luck year
{or the Pioneers. Of the'nine
conference defeats, six were by
a total of 18 points and one
nonrconference loss was by two
points in an overtime.

On the individual front, John
Sundell the backbone of the
team for three years, got a fist
full of new records, three for
rebounds, including one game
(31), season (443), and career
(1.031). He also has the best
season shooting percentage
(51.7) and most fouls for ca-
reer (200),

Right behind is Jim Mifflin,
the conference’s leading scor-
er, who tied the career point-
making record or 1,103 and
broke the career free throwing
standard of 357.

The last one belongs to Jeff
Frantz, who came up with
391 points, a new sophomore
standard. Frantz pushed by
the total by gathering in 83
markers in the last three
games.

On the season, Mifflin was
the team’s leading scorer with
438, including a single game
high of 37. This gave Mifilin a
19.9 average for the 22 games,

Gruenewald Genera/ins on Greeks
ﬁnds Them Proud, Contradictory

Ruth Gruenewald is cur-
rently a Fifth Year Student
teaching and studying abroad
In Greece as.part of the
fl'ravel ~ Service scholarship
program.

It’s) awfully hard, you know,
not to generalize about a cul-
ture of which you know little,
Harder still when you know a
little more. Many times this
year I felt somewhat resentful
when people would exclaim,
~"Why, you’re not a typical
'American at all." Not that I
Would like to be typical you
understand; to my way of
thinking there is no Such thin

The Greeks here in Saloniki
seem to feel differently though;
there is nothing they like bet-
ter than generalizing about
themselves. “I am a Greek,"
says the man at the corner
kiosk, and he pounds his chest
with pride. ”I fought against
the Communists; my father
fought against the Turks; we
are a brave and strong people,
_we Greeks.”

“We are a passionate peo-
ple," says the lady who sells
flowers at the’market. “We
sing and we weep, we quarrel
and we love. It is our nature,
our heritage.”

”I am a Greek," says the
university student seriously,
“because I love two things
above all else, my country and
my freedom. For these I would
gladly face death. We are a
proud, liberty-loving people, we
Greeks."

Now I am no man on the
street collecting samples of
opinions about national charac-
ter. These are just bits of con-
yersations volunteered freely
by people I have met. They all
take the qualities dearest to
themselves and enlarge them so
as to encompass the whole na<
tion, They can do this because
they employ a kind of logic
that admits all sorts of contra-
dictions. So whatever they say
is right.

In H e o d contradictoriness
seems to be the essence here.
Let me give a few examples, all
of which occurred Within a
space of one hour.

At the Saloniki railroad sta—
tion, a crowd gathered at the
ticket window (queues are un-
known), and as I stood patient-
ly waiting (because I am
neither brave nor strong). I
was literally knocked down by
an impulsive young man who
obviously'knew how to use his
elbows and knees, It’s a little
disturbing to be standing in
front of a railroad ticket win-
dow one minute and sitting on
the floor the. next. But I didn't,
say anything because. . r .
well . . . the young man must
have had his reasons, and be-

sides I'm not a passionate and,

quarrelsome Greek. So I picked
myself up’ with quiet dignity;
but at that point to my utter
amazement, the gentleman in
question turned around and
with an absolutely sincere dis
play of gallantry offered me his
place, his hard-won place, right
.In front of the little window.

Having procured my ticket I
proceeded to the post office
where a package from America
was waiting for me. There is a
great deal of red tape involved
in picking up a package. One
must first find the correct
room (different sized parcels
go to different places), then one
must produce one's passport,
sign on several dotted lines, etc.
On this particular day (the pro-
cedure was especially trying.
You see, the little box addressed
to me contained a packet of
bath salts, something highly
suspect in the eyes of the postal
clerk. He informed me that I
would have to pay duty, and
that the duty would amount to
exactly three times as much as
the original product had cost.

I pleaded innocence, poverty,
illness, all to no avail. So, hav-
ing reasoned with myself that,
after all, I had no bath tub any-
way, and other related argu—
ments, I informed the clerk
that I did not wish to accept the
package and asked him if he
would send it back to America
or keep it for his girlfriend
This last remark must have
wounded the pride of my brave
young clerk; for he tore open
the wrapping and dumped the
contents—thousands of shining
pink crystals—on the floor.
Then with a polite bow and a
brief Salutation which translates
approximately as ”Go with
joy" he stalked out of the
room.

I left the post office quickly
and embarked upon the last ad-
venture of the hour. On my way
home I passed a little grocery
store and decided to stop and
buy a few things. The grocer
was weighing some vegetables
for another customer, and as I
waited, I noticed that his thumb
was on the scale, adding to the
actual weight. But this time I
was ready for a good fight, and
when my turn came and the

 

man charged me twenty dracl-u
mas, I told him I would pay no
more than ten. We proceeded to
barter, and finally the price
was fixed at fourteen. But
when I took out my purse, the
grocer suddenly smiled and
said, ”For you the price is
seven drachmas.” Well, I tried
to look nonchalant as I paid
him and scooped up lny pack-
ages, but curiosity won out, so
I turned back to ask why the
sudden low price. “Oh,” he re-
piled, “I am a Greek, and we
Greeks are generous people,
you know."

It is difficult not to general-
ize about a culture of which
ones know little. . . . very diffi-

cult.

great development. It seems to
me to offer an unusual chal-
lenge and an opportunity for
public service.

I have a special interest in it
also because Mrs. Bowen and
I both attended it as graduate
students and I started my
teaching career there, having
served seven years on the I30
ulty. I might add that I am
interested in it because it is lo-
cated in Iowa, a state that I
have grown to consider my
home and where I feel very
much at home. Parenthetically,
I am glad that Iowa. City is
close to Grinnell because I
shall always retain a deep in-
terest in Grinnell,‘ and I hope
to maintain my friendships
here.

Please forgive me for being
so personal in these remarks
this morning, but I thought you
might be interested 'in my com-
ments on leaving Grinnell and
that you had a right to know
the facts.
