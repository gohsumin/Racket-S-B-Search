For Off-Campus Address Special Faculty Meeting

SAGA Option

By Molly McGuire

Nineteen offscarnpus seniors
will be able to cook their own
stew for tharremainder of the
year as a result of the Saga
referendum held last Tuesday.
With 64% of the student body
voting (an unusually large
turnout for a referendum), the
result was 403-290 in favor of
allowing the nineteen to forego
their board fees, although it
means paying an increase of
about $3.65 per boarder next
semester.

Another sidereffect of the op-
tion will be the necessitation
of a checking system in the
dining halls. Effective October
6, according to the rererendum,
each boarder will be required
to give his meal card number
to a checker and in some Cases
identify himseli upon entering
the dining room for each meal.

in another section of the ref-
erendum, a small majority in-
dicated they did not want more
Saga options, presumably be-
cause more options, according
to the referendum, would an-
tail showing a photo LD. card
at each meal.

But most students did vote in
favor of the college issuing
ID. cards to each student to
provide pillar of identity, age,
and student status, According
to the Student Coordinator's
Office these will be issued soon.

The business of a special fac-
ulty meeting on Monday was
“special business” — presenta-
tions by the administration

that were in some cases re- ,

quested by the faculty.

No proposals could be dis-
cussed or voted on because of
the irregular nature of the
meeting, although at one point
a proposal was made for action
on the Oct. l5 Vietnam Mora-
torium. “It couldn’t be voted
on, because this was a special
meeting,” explained Professor
John Worley (Phil), secretary
of the faculty. Also ruled out
Was discussion of the recent cona
troversial proposal for student
participation in faculty meet-
ings.

There were three items on
the agenda at Monday’s meet-
ing. “A tight money situation"
prompted‘tlie first, according
to Worley. Dean Joseph Wall's
presentation was on the ques-
tion of ways and means of cut.
ting costs and achieving a suf-
iicient level of incoming giiis
to support the current opera-
tions. Chairman of the Faculty
John Kieinschmldt commented,
“We need ways to meet the fi-
nancial problems which become
more acute with inflation and
the skittishness of potential
givers in view of tax i-eiorin."

A general proposal by Presia
dent Leggett through the facul-
ty‘s Organization Committee on

effecting ways of involving stu-
dents in curricular considera-
tions was also presented The
so-far unpublicized statement
used the words “orderly, mean-
ingful” to describe the consid-
eration or ways to involve stu.
dents.

The final agenda item was A
clarification by Dean Waldo
Walker of the current budget,

distributed part of the budget's
details, answered questions on

Angered by possible indica-

“crackdown” on the illegal use
of drugs, some 250 students gath-
ered in front of Burling Library
late Wednesday afternoon to
protest a statement reportedly
formulated by the resident ad-
vlsers earlier in the day upon
Dean Alice LDw’s instructions.

The statement, which was
mimeographed and distributed
to students by several members
of the senate, said: “if we

“By status quo, ! mean before

Wednesday, said he will issue a

Tuesday night’s Senate meet-
lng was brief, and no earth—
shaldng business occurred. The
only real crisis was over the
iunding of the all»camplls ple-
nlo planned for Saturday with
the Grinnell High School stu-
dents. Senator Andrew Brill re
quested a finance committee

meeting to find the necessary
funds, and called {or an emer-
gency senate meeting later in
the week to approve the allo-
cation, '

A constitutional reform com-
mittee was set up to form pro-
posals for clariiying and modi-
fying the present SGA Consti»
tiltion. The committee will be
chaired by Assistant Student
Coordinator S tev e Schwartz,
and it will consider election
reforms and hall judicial coun-
cil reforms, as m o n g other
things,

The senate once again tabled
a motion on the Betts commit-
tee proposal to the faculty that
would allow students ten vol-
lng representatives on the lac-
ulty. president Leggett is is.
portedly forming proposals of
his own, and the Senate thought
it should wait until the matter
was clarified,

Senator Bill Straliger's mo-
tion to invite Mr. Hawn to next
week's senate meeting to dis-
cuss the maid situation was
passed, A number of senators
expressed dissatistaction with

the present maid service. Now
that the new maid system has
had a chance to operate, Stran—
ger felt that Hawn ought to be
consulted again belore the sen-
ate makes any recommenda-
tions.

The Student Coordinator’s or.
floe has received a number of
complaints about line cutting
at the dining rooms, it was an-
nounced The office is consid-
ering the possibility of some
sort or enforcement system,
perhaps involving SGA ofﬁcials
as “policemen." The Coordina-
tor’s office also had a com-
plaint that senate meeting
minutes were unavailable.

Senior Larry r-ranir made
a motion that the senate attend
Monday night’s City Council
meeting where he plans to in<
troduce a resolution supporting
the principle or me Vietnam
Moratorium. The senate passed
the measure and urged any
interested students to attend.

Senator Hill Thomas gave a
report trom the Health Center
committee. The committee is
basically looking into three
things: 1) investigation or a
better health insurance plan;
2) investigation or the possi<
bility of having a doctor on
campus; and 3) investigating
the possibility or getting a
clinical psychologist on cam-
pus part time. Thomas was op-
timistic about the ﬁrst and

cussing ways of spreading in.
formation about the event.
Plans were made to cummuni~
cate with the raculty. Various
methods, such as leaﬂetting,
were proposed for encouraging
townspeople to participate,

Senior Larry Frank an-

Sludenl Opera. Opens Tomorrow

Long hours or research and
rehearsal will culminate in the
student production ot Monte-
verdi's ll Hallo Belle Ingrqto
tonight and tomorrow night at
a pm. in Herrick Chapel.

The opera, written in 1607 in
Msntua. is one of the earliest
ever written. Somewhat resem-
bling the English ”Masques"
or me same period, the short
opera tells how Cupid’s arrows
of love lost their ellect because
contemporary women were so
Gold to their lovers.

The action begins when Venus
and Cupid go to the mouth or
Hell to request a favor of Plu-
tone, the Devil. They ask him
to release some “ungrateful
women” from Hell as an ex-
ample to the women in the
audience.

Aiter some persuasion, Plu-
tone consents, and the hallo
deIle lngratc (dance or the un-
grateiul women) begins. At the
end or the opera, Plutone or-
ders all the women to return to
Hell, but an especially unhappy
one lingers tor a moment to
finish the show with a sad de'
scription of her late.

Heading the cast are sopho<

Seniur Wants Yearbook

To the Editor:

1 read with great disappoints
ment the plan to put out no
yearbook this year. i am a sen-
ior and the problems this 0014
iege has had in producing a
yearbook is truly amazing. it is
too bad that the Class ot 1970
will have no yearbook to look
back to after we've lett Grln<
nell. 1 am not in favor ct elimis
nating the literary magazine, but
it is no substitute.

What can he done? First of
all, I believe that a yearbook
could still be put out this year.
Money could be raised. assum—
ing the SGA rcally can't give
any, ii-om immediate advanced
soles. it might not be the best
book, but it would be some
thing tor the class oi low to
look back to, to remind us ot
our time spent here. And, even
it this can't be done, l rccom
mend that from now on money
be set aside each year fur
the production cl a yearbook
and that no one tamper with
these funds, i spent live years
at a school with a total enroll-
ment oi 250 students and a
graduating class oi 24; yet, i
have five yearbooks tor thcso
years and l cnyoy looking back.
There was never any trouble
turning these out, and they were
tree. There is no reason why a
college ot 1150 students which
must get more money than a
small secondary school, can't
produce a yearbook, even it
it costs the student about $10.
Perhaps the Senate should cone
sidcr this rather than worrying
about allocating money tor a
dog house tor a stray mutt and
the problems at the world. And,
it this is all the sell. the calir
pus newspaper has to print,
perhaps we can dispense with
it and get ourselves a yearbook.

E ITORIAL

Alice In Blunderldml

Dean Alice Low this week blew the lid off Gtim’lell's already
turbulent drug situation and plunged the campus into total cun-
iusion about the remarkably muddled college drug policy. The
clean “clarified” the drug policy by instructing resident advisers
to report to the deans when they are “reasonably certain" that a
student is “under the influence of an illegal drug.”

Such a policy is simply absurd. it would inequitabiy discipline
students by setting up an arbitrary guessing game tor the resi-
dent advisers' amusement. Perhaps the naive dean wants the
resident advisers to use birdswalching techniques — spotting and
identifying drug users by their bright red eyes and long hair.

Ii. is astounding to learn that the college seeks to disciplina
students {or being “under the inﬂuence or drugs.” Even America’s
unjust drug laws, which impose harsh penalties tor the possession
or sale of certain drugs, do not regard “being under lhe inﬂu-
ence” as a crime.

Even more distressing is the fact that Dean Low's RA enlurce-
ment policy has virtually destroyed any conﬁdence students with
drug problems might have had in their resident advisers. For a
troubled student drug user to seek counseling from a resident ad-
viser is now about as likely as a guilt-ridden mass murderer stop-
plug in to chat with J. Edgar Hoover or Richard Turner.

While Dean Low's policy was absurd in itself, the higllrllanded
and illegitimate techniques she used in formulating it were flair
bergasting, it is not surprising — and is in tact typical e that the
dean did not consult students when lormulating the policy. But
the mind boggles at the realization that she did not consult the
president, the faculty, or even (according to several RA'S) (ha
resident advisers. Dean Law’s sudden snatching of decision-mak-
ing power was a kick in the crotch to students whu had been led
by President Leggett to believe that resident advisers would be
counselors, rather than animals or inloriuei-s.

The Low escapade has significance lar beyond the drug issue,
because it has exposed in studenls the real manner in which tha
decisionsmaking process works at Griniiell, Students are actually
irrelevant in the decisionmaking process that spits out the ad-
ministrative policies under which they must live.

The administration shrewdly paciiies students by allowing
them token representation on cummlttees, but in the final an-
alysis: Hurling Basement is the source of all power. That is why
the college drug policy iormulated by last year’s Student Aliairs
Committee was mysteriously eliminated over the summer and.
replaced this tall by President Leggett's drug policy. That is why
President Leggett will decide how to deﬁne the resident advisers’
role in the drug policy. That is why three students were placed
on conduct probation tor illegal drug use.

The exlsting decision-making process at Grinncll can no longer
be tolerated. And judging by student reaction to this week’s Low
blow, it will not be tolerated. AS Bob Dylan has observed, “The

order is rapidly changing." Grinnell students are linally waking
up — more power to them. .

Prof Defends "Channels"

To the Editor:

it seems to me that student
government here might gain by
a reorganization. At present,
student government does incor—
porate the principle that all
students should be represented
in a parliamentary body by
elected delegates; but student
government has lacked impor»
tance and “relevance." here as
elsewhere. because the delibera—
tions ot this body have not he
ccssarily led to the College’s i-c—
considering its policies.

i suspect that those recent
changes which have placed stu-
dents on most ot the faculty's
standing committees, however,
have signaled a real change in
the signiiieance of student
“participation" in the College’s
nffau's.

Despite the fact that no stu—
dcnt-taculty committee has tiic
linal say on a given matter, so
that ratification of many deci-
sions is required in division

CONSPIRACY TRIAL OPENS IN CHICAGO

By Tom Thomas

with an estimated five thou-
land demonstrators in the
streets, the trial of the Conspir-
Icy Eight began in Chicago
on Wednesday, September 14.
Facing federal charges of
violating the anti-riot provisions
of the 1965 Civil Rights Act are
the leaders of disturbances
during the 1968 Democratic
Convention.

The eight are: David Dellin-
Ker. head of the National Mo-
bilization to End the War in
.Vietnam; Jerry Rubin and
‘Abbie Hoffman of the Yippies;
Bobby Seals, national chair.
man of the Black Panther
Party; Rennie Davis, a founder
of SD , Tom Hayden, author
of the Port Huron statement,
founding manifesto of SDS;
John Frnines,
Oregon professor and early
member of SDS, SNCC, and
CORE; and Lee Weiner, teach-
ing assistant at Northwestem
University and National Mu~
bilization staff member.

in an opening statement, the
prosecution said it would intro-
duce testimony to show that the
defendants conspired to prix
mote rioting and told large
crowds to arm themselves and
to resist police, city officials
and national guardsme

The defense Counter “The
evidence in this case will show
that police embarked on a con-
spiracy of berserk, brutal ac-
tion . . . that the real consp -
ucy in this case was a conspir-
acy to curtail and prevent the
protest against the war in Viet-
nam.”

RALLY HELD

Confrontation began before
presiding District Court Judge
Julius J. Hoffman even reached
the bench. The defendants re-
fused to stand when the judge
ontcred the courtroom Hoffman
promptly ordered a u. so mar—
shal to force them to comply.
Outside the Federal Building,

University of ,

which houses the courtroom,
thousands. of youths milled
about, many having been there
throughout the night. The pro.
testors h e l d a candlelight
march from Lincoln Park to the
sight of the trial and then stay-
ed for an allrnight vigil.

The crowd swelled during the
morning as guorilla theater
groups performed and “wit-
ches" sought to “cxorcire evil
spirits" from the courtroom.
The rally was joined by six of
the defendants during a lunch
recess. Jerry Rubin and Bobby
scale were both held by federal
marshals. Rubin is serving a
45—day sentence on a charge
dating from‘ the Berkeley Free
Speech Movement and Seale is
under indictment on a murder
Conspiracy charge in Connection
with the death of a former
Black Panther.

SDS LEADERS ARRESTED

The rally was disrupted by
two youths wearing swastikas
and by white construction
workers angered at recent
demonstrations by Chicago
black groups seeking jobs in
construction unions. Chicago
golice rapidly arrived and the
emonstrators moved in Grant
Park. At the park there were
minor fights between demons
strators and police, and 19 were
arrested, including four SDS
members. Three other SDS
leaders were arrested on war-
rants the next day. On Friday
(the 26th) three more SDS
members were arrested, bring-
ing due total to ten with total
bail set at $55,000. Cha Cha
Jimenez, leader of the Young
Lords, a militant Puerto Rican
group, was also arrested.

Judge Hoffman began the
trial on Wednesday by issuing
bench warrants for the, arrest
of four defense attorneys after
the prosecutor, U. S. Attorney
Thomas A. Foran called their
absence “so incredibly irres-
ponsible and unprofessional that

it would be unbelievable if one
did nDt take into account some
of their prior acu’ons."

The warrants were issued for
Michael J r Kennedy, Michael E.
Tiger, and Dennis J. Roberts.
all of California, and Joel H.
Lefcourt of New York.

CLAIM HARASSMENT

The team of lawyers who are
defending the Conspiracy Eight
picked a trial counsel team 'to
handle the case The team con-
sists of Charles Garry, Bill
Kunstler, and Lee Weinglass. it
was felt that three rather than
seven lawyers could deal with
the case. Lefwurt, one of the
four for whom warrants were is
sued called the action “an ill
gal form of harassment and inti-
midation against political law-
yers for the purpose of prevent-
ing radical clients from obtain-
ing lawyers who wrll defend
themr”

Tiger, a law professor at
UCLA. was flown to Chicago
In handcuffs Lefcourt voluntar-
ily surrendered and, with Tiger.
was held in the Cook County
jail. Both attorneys were sub-
sequently released on their own
recognizance by the 7th U.S.
Court of Appeals.

The arrest warrants against
the other two attorneys were
quashed by Judge Albert Wol-
lenburg of the U. S. District
Court in San Francisco. Wollen-
burg said the proceedings did
not comply with the law.

On Monday, September 29th,
Judge Hoffman dismissed the
charges against the defense at-
torneys and allowed them to
withdraw from the case.

JURY SELECTED

Earlier in the trial, contro-
versy emerged over the sc.
leciion of jurors on Thursday.
Judge Hoffman refused to allow
either side to directly question
prospective jurors. lnste ad
lawyers were instructed to sub-
mit questions to Hoffman who
then decided whether or not
they should be asked.

Defense attorneys wanted to

h n o w prospective jurors
opinions on the Vietnam war,
long hair, drugs, and the right
of political dissent (one question
was “Can you identify Janis
Joplin?). Huffman refused to
ask any questions dealing with
these areas. Following the sc-
lection of the jury, which con-
sists of two white men and ten
women (two of them black), d9
fense counsel William Kunstler
laid, “We feel the jury has not
been asked a singls relevant
Question."

POSTPONEMENT DENIED

Another blow to the defense
came on Friday when Hoffman
denied a request for postpone-
ment on the grounds that Chiar-
les Garry, one of the defense
lawyers, was seriously ill in
California and could not be pre-
sent in court. Bobby Scale, in
particular, claimed that Garry
was his attorney and that un<
der the Sixth Amendment he
was guaranteed counsel of his
choice. The court ordered the
defense to proceed with the at-
tomeys at hand.

One light moment did occur
during Friay’s proceedings.
Defendant Abbie Hoffman blew
a kiss to the jury when he was
officially "introduced to the
court.”

“The jury will disregard the
kiss thrown by the defendant,"
Judge Hoffman solemnly pro—
claimed. .

On Monday, September 29,
the defense submitted a motion
for a mistrial. Defense counsel
Kunstler said the judge should
either declare a mistrial or dis-
qualify himself because he “has
degraded, harassed and
maligned defense attorneys in
the trial." Kunstlcr further
charged that Judge Hoffman
has tried to coerce the defend~
ants to waive meir constitution-
al rights m counsel of their
choice, has threatened defense
lawyers with contempt charger
and often has interrupted the

fense lawyers during their on
guments.

Prosecuting attorney Thomal
A. Foran, arguing against thl
motion, accused the defendants
and their lawyers of trying the
case in the press rather than
in the courtroom. Foran called
the conduct of the defense ats
torneys “incredible. . . and ap-
palling." The motion wal
denied by the court.

Judge Hoffman also denied
another defense motion for a
hearing on the constitutionality
of two Chicagorordinances ap-
plying to permits for parades
and sleeping in city parks. Tho
defense had maintained that tho
constitutionality of the laws was
the “heart and crux of the man-
tcr in this trial."

Richard A. Schultz, assistant
US. Attorney, had earlier
told that court that several of
the defendants did not really
want the permits they had re-
quested to sleep in Lincoln Parli
or march to the International
Ampitheater.

JUROR DISMISSED

The trial took an unexpected
turn Wednesday, October 1.
when the youngest member of
the jury, Kristi King, 23, was
excused from further dut
Miss King stated that she
could not remain impartial
after being shown a letter
which her family received tho
previous Monday.

The letter Said, “You are be-
ing watched," and was signed
“The Black Panthers.”

Miss King had not seen the
letter until it was given to her
at the order of Judge Hoff-
man.

The defense objected to tho
court's action in the matter.
“The government, in an extra-
ordinary maneuver, succeeded
in sondbagging a member of
the jury of whom it did not ap-
prove," said defendant David
Dellingcr.

Another juror, Mrs. Ruth 1..

 

October 3. I969

Peterson, received an Identical
letter, but said It would not al-
fect her decision in the case,
The defense subsequently sub-
mitted a motion for a mistrial
when Mrs. Peterson was not
excused, but was overruled.

As the Conspiracy trial con-
tinues, attention is beginning to
focus on the coming “second.
battle of Chicago,” massive
antiwar actions planned for
October 8711 by SDS, the Black
Panthers, and the Young Lords.

TWO "ACTIONS" PLANNED

There will be two separate and
diiierent actions in Chicago,
both aimed at supporting the
Vietnamese and getting the
U.S. out of Southeast Asia.

One action, planned by the
National Office “Weatherman"
faction 0! SDS, includes a mass
rally and march, but will prim-
arily’ focus on mobile street-
lighting, aimed at increasing
the militancy of the white
movement by showing that
whites are willing to light.

The 'other action, called
jointly by the niack Panther
Party, the Young Lords, and
the Revolutionary Youth Move-
ment II (RYMJI) group of
SDS, will consist of a "disc!-
plined mass march” through
black, white and Latin working
class communities, to be pre«
ceded by three days of action.
The build-up includes support
activities for the Black Panther
Breakfast for Children program
and the Lord's Day Care Cen-
ter, a high school and junior
college hoycott and march to the
Board of Education, a rally
around the Chicago Internati0n<
ll Harvester Plant, and an
action intended to protest "in-
human practices of Chicago
hospitals — such as the invol~
untary sterilization of black and
Latin women."

The two sets of plans come

in the wake of the much dis-
cussed SDS "split" last sum.
mer. Aiter purging the PN-
gressivo Labor Party, two
groups were leit contending tor
SDS control —- RYM-II and
Weatherman (from lollisinger
Bob Dylan; "you don’t need a
weatherman to know which
way the wind blows")

SDS unanimously agreed to
a mass action in support or the
Vietnamese people and against
U. s. imperialism to be held
in Chicago roughly coinciding
With the Conspiracy trials.
Planning was left to the
National Office Controlled by
the Weatherman faction.

TO BUILD A “RED ARMY”

Since the summer SDS con-
vention, Weatherman has devel»
oped a plan or action, produced
leaﬂets, and organized urban
working-class communities to
bring people to Chicago. The
Weathermen have been organ-
lzing under the theme of “Bring
the War Home." They see the
action in Chicago as an oppor-
tunity to hegin building a “red
army to fight on the side of
the Vietnamese, the blacks, and
oppressed people everywhere."

The superrmilltancy of
Weatherman, however, has an«
tagonized many 0! the New
Left, The plans {or “mobile
street lighting" are viewed by
some as a masochistic suicidal
attempt to Create “instant
history."

AS a result (if the disenchant—
ment with Weatherman, RYM-
II, the “other" 505 group
formed a quick coalition with
the Panthers and Lords to draw
up alternate plans for the Chi-
cago action. Most observers be-
lieve the RYM-IT Panthericrd
proposals are certain to attract
much larger numbers of par-
ticipants.

Both groups are anticipating

repressive measures by
Chicago’s police.‘ “You could
get busted tor standing on the
comer and saluting the ﬂag,"
commented a Chicago organ-
izer. Demonstration leaders
view the police actions on the
opening day or the trial as
merely a “\varmrup” (or things
[0 follow. '

CALL TO CHICAGO

While millions have spoken
out against the war, millions
more have remained silent
in their opposition. Recogniz-
ing that these silent millions
can be a great iorco in
bringing the aggressive,
white-supremacist war to an
end, as well as being the
basis or a poweriul antirim-
perlalist movement, we call
for a mass action In Chicago
from Oct. 8 to ll, consisting
oi 4 days of programs and
militant actions designed to
serve the needs oi the people
of the U.S., and to connect
those needs with the fight
against U.S. aggression in
Vietnam. We call {or the ac-
tion to culminate in a mass
militant disciplined march
behind the demand U.S.
GET OUT OF VIETNAM
NOW and other demands
which will link the struggles
oi the exploited and ap—
pressed people of the U.S.
with the struggle of the
Vietnamese.

We call for this action as
the start of the YEAR OF
SOLIDARlTY WITH THE
PEOPLE OF VIETNAM.

Griune lWoliien's I.

By Mary Edwards
Chairman,
Grinnell Women‘s Liberation

From numerous conversations
with Grinnell faculty and stu-
dents i find that very few
people on campus understand
what women's liberation means.
our group lmage varies: we
sire seen as either bitchy men—
haters who secretly want to be
men, or a collection of innocu-
ous doegooders, or rabid femi<
nlsts fighting for “female
rights." We are none or the
above. Rather, we are female
students, iaculty, and wives or
taculty who are unhappy about
what being a Woman in our
society has come to mean, We
are interested in redeﬁning the
female role to include more of
tlle human and less of the SH-
perficially feminine.

It may surprise some to
learn that our focus is not on
male oppression but on seli—
suppression. We are appalled
when we realize how we have
been carefully trained to de-
mand very little of ourselves.
We are not expected to be as
bright as men, to work as hard.
to be as actively involved in
issues and ideas. Many or us
h a v e unconsciously accepted
this comfortable role through
out childhood, in college and
even in graduate school. We
are trained to be passive, dec<
orative objects rather than ac~
Live, thinking human beings.
Whenever we think about wom-
en's “liberation" we ﬁnd that
our most difficult task is to
liberate ourselves from a de-
humanizing self-image which
protects and Cuddles us, We
feel uncomfortable in our [on

comfortable femininity.

My personal initiation into
women's liberation came about
as a result of long association
with radical political groups.
These supposedly radical men
questioned every American in-
stitution while blindly perpetu-
atlng the myth of female in-
fei'iority. They talked polit
we took minutes. They di
cussed strategy: we made coi-
fee. Most frightening and eye-
opening was our rinal realiza-
tion that we had never ques-
tioned the division of power, We
rarely contributed to discus-
sions because we felt ourselves
to be incapable of analytical
thinking. We thought of our
selves as slightly fuzzyelieaded
sis/roads. We were both angry
at our male iriends ioi put-
ting us don-n and at ourselves
for allowing them to do so,

So I became interested in
liberation, in seeking treedoin
from restrictions imposed by
society and perpetuated by no-
thinking men and women.
Many men ask with a smile.
sneer, or leer, “what do you
want to be liberated from?"
They often assume that we are
simply concerned with sexual
treedom and magnanimously
offer their help, Married men
are usually more aware of the
complexity and seriousness or
our concerns but have much
at stake in preserving the es-
tablished feminine role, They
are right to feel threatened in
one sense: “liberated" wives
may be unwilling to accept
liomemaking as a full-time

career. 0n the other hand, we
wonder why intelligent men
Want [0 Come home to women
whose most challenging reading
comes from the pages or net-
ter Homes and Gardens. Are
they really so insecure about
their own abilities that they
need the assurance of no in-
telleclual challenge at home?

Other critics of women's lib-
eriition think that we want to
erase all sex dlfferences, While
we do not claim that this would
be possible or even desirable,
we are interested in finding out
which diflel‘ences are real and
which are learned. Are wom-
en less logical and more EmO‘
tional than men or have we
been trained to be marshmal-
Iow heads? DD females neces-
sarily reel a natural aihnity for
dishwater? We learn from tele-
vision and magazines that our
primary concerns should be to
choose the best detergent, the
sexiest lipstick, the most femia
nine mouthwash. Last year’s
Miss America represents the
ideal woman as defined by ad-
vertising in her statement that
during her year's reign her
“love of Toni hair products,
Pepsi Cola and Oldsmobile"
became a “spontaneous part”
or her. Miss America 1970's
goal in life is “to be a nice
person" — the cheeriul com-
bination oi hair spray, coke.
and cars.

Our dissatisfaction with the
female image is rooted in per-
sonal frustration but leads to
basic questioning of social in-
stitutions. The women's liber—

MOVIE PREVIEWS

The War Game: ‘A Must To See'

By a Staff Writer

T h l S weekend‘s , cinematic
goings-on at ARH are The War
Game (Friday 9:00, Sunday
8:30) and Nothing But the
Best (Saturday 3:00 and lU:BO)i
For those who worry about itt
yes, The War Game is relevant
and still manages to be good.
It’s a simulated documentary
about World War Ill‘s devasta-
tion oi a small village far ir’om
any city.

This harrowing, abrasive film
created a horrified (and in
some quarters, angry) stir
when made a couple ol‘ years
ago for the BBC. Peter Wat-
kins, who has directed several
excellent BBC documentaries
of the real-live Variety, made
the ﬁlm:

Unhappily, serious, controver-
sial movies like The War Game
are often attended only by

people sure that the point of
view expressed is their own,
Such movies are pointless it
only nodded at in approval, so
if you have the slightest disin-
cllnation -- please go. Whether
you are socially and politically
conscientious, a student of the
cinema, or like scary movies,
it should prove ”(631)! reward-
ing."

Nothing But the Best, on the
other and jollier hand, is a
light British comedy starring
Alan Bates and a red-headed
lady named Millicent Martin.
It's a spoof of Life at the Top,
but readily diggable without
prior knowledge, due process,
or much or anything else. Jon
Stein, friendly neighborhood
movies chairman, has said that
a list of ARH movies will be
published soon, He is the man
to cheer on or hiss about movie
selection.

composed of deans, faculty

Some of the students who as
lembied at the library about
4:30 wore signs saying. “We’re
all stoned; What are you going
to do about it." Shortly after-
wards, the group went to the
Forum and crammed into South
Lounge for an informal, discus-
sion about the new statement
with Deans Alice Low and Con-
niu Kimbo.

Several students cursed audle
biy as Mrs. Low tried to answer
questions put to her by the
crowd Asked why the state
ment was necessary, the Dean
replied, “Every smgle student
must know exactly where we
bland."

However, attempts by the ad-
ministration to clarify the drug
policy in recent weeks have re-
sulted in much confusion. At
Wednesday’s discussion both
deans said that Leggett's state.
ment and the new resident ads
visers’ statement are “vague."
Dean Low commented, “Every
person must define for himself
how he fits into the policy." The
deans maintained that. the new
statement was merely a clari-
fication or the existing policy.

Many students complained
that the new policy as “clari-
fied” by the resident advisers
would alienate students by

most significant decisions will

body takes them up, i would
argue that the present student
seats are too important to lie
outside student government.

I would suggest that. a consti-
tutional framework be adopted
which does provide tor some
number of residenually elected
members of a student senate,
so that the individual student
is still represented by someone
he elects, but that in addition
all those who successfully peti—

sit in a student senate.

These latter students know
what their committees are con.
sidering and preparing; they
know something of faculty sentie
ment on these matters. They

the student senate is to be cap

weighty legislation in the name

In reply to Mr. Cooper’s
thoughtful letter (printed in

can only say that it is quite
true that both committee work
and parliamentary debate are
often slow. It may take a great

and that body may send it back
to committee, table it. for some
Weeks, or in various ways tako
up a great while before actual-
ly passing or killing it (com-
plete with substitutions and
amendments).

But legislation to deal with
a complex problem may itself be
complex if it is to prove work-
able; and even if both issue and
legislation can be tersely
phrased, the considerations to
be weighed may be difficult
and the body divided. Only
time, in which everyone con-
cerned can think the matter
over, make up his mind, and
reconcile himself, perhaps, to
the likely defeat of his position,
can grease the wheels sufficient
1y to allow any new legislation
to emerge at all.

Senior Michael Penzner, presi-

that counselors be separated

Much confusion arose over
exactly who was responsible for
the new interpretation of the
role of the resident advisers.
Many students have charged
that Dean Low formulated the
statement without the R.A.’s
knowledge. Dean Low stated,
.“We (the deans) have never put
a statement out." Apparently,
Dean Low’ instructed the resi-
