“Group at Grinnell" '

A recent story in the Des Moines Register discuss-
ing the Fair Play for Cuba committee, under the sub-
head ”Group at Grinnell,” revealed that the Grinnell Sill-
dent Council was on the Fair Play For Cuba Committee’s
mailing list.

What the story did not go on to clairify is that there
never has been, nor is tllere presently, a Grinnell chapter
of the Fair Play for Cuba committee.

We are getting sick of trying to convince the world
that though Grinnell students were interested in all sides
of the Cuban question, the position of the committee

was one with which even sympathetic Grinnellians couldl

not completely agree. '

The sub-head “Group at Grinnell” is either so am-
biguous as to be misleading or an out and out misrepre-
sentation of fact. How many times must we clarify our
position?

The Davis-McManus Leller

Just before the American Revolution several “faith-
less” colonial malcontents, disagreeing with English foreign
policy, wrote the Declaration of Independence It was not
much later that groups of sockless, unshaven, hairy men
fought for such things as Hunt Davis’s and Craig Mc-
Manlls’s light to write letters such as the one which ap-
peared in this week’s Des Moines Register.

They laughed at long-haired Einstein, and Stevenson
was called an egg-head because he couldn’t find time to
have his shoes repaired. Messers Davis and McManus's
letter is certainly not unprecedented in the good ole’ safe
conformist tradition.

As much as we may resent one group’s attempting
to represent themselves as all of Grinnnell College, we
likewise deeply resent the Davis—McManus use of “all
Grinnell" figures that are as unverifiable as their im-
plied definition of ”beat."

Before the gentlemen from Smith go on another
letter»writing binge we would suggest that they remem-
ber that they represent a school purporting the so—callefl
liberal posture. In this light, the sort of narrow-minded

ness which their letter reflected is p llblicity of a far more,

detrimental sort than anything which has come out of that
group of “belittlers of foreign policy."

To the editor:

John Kennedy disagrees wilh
the foreign, economic and so.
cial policies of the Eisenhower
administrations. Stevenson, Rusk
and Bowles disagree with lhc
present administration’s policy
on Cuba. Richard Nixon is
presently acting as the cons
science of the Democratic party

The naivete of the purpose of
critical dissent apparenl in some
of our students surprises me.
Primarily, lhis action creates
an awareness of a problem. The
state, whether il is local. state
or nolional, is nol 2n infallible

‘ cnlily.

1f lhc southern Negro had
continued lo accept the Local
state's policy of segregation
and refused in dissent. the
moral posilivc good of the
sit.ins would have never oc-
curred.

The dissenter is the con—
scicncc of lhe state and society
and, in being such. insures
the existence of this elementary
right of the individual in a de-
mocracy.

The basic difference between
our democracy and the totalitar—
ian state is lhc right of the
minorily to exist, and if neces-
sary, lo disagree wilh lhc pow.
ers which govern them. If we
condemn lhis right. we arc no
'better than lhis political idc.
ology we so steadfastly oppose.
I would hope that we do not
fall into the false sccurily of
conformity with the belief lhal
our government’s policies
principles are infallible.

LETTERS

Cont, from p 2

Communists condemned, but for
mer Communists must suffer for
their past — unless they actively
turn against their onetime asso—
ciates. And the ostracism or pun—
ishment extends to those who,
though not party members, agree
with some of the party’s pro—l
gram, or will not expressly disso—l
ciate themselves from the pre—
scribed group, Accordingly, a
person of liberal views is often
impelled to say “but I am no
Communist," forgetting .that he
is thus reenforcing the biased
feeling of others.

it is surely unnecessary e es—
pecially after Professor Eurkle’s
sermon — to say much about the
harm which this blanket condem~
nation does to our foreign policy,

What are some outstanding fear

,tures of states which proclaim
themselves communistic? There
is in them very little opportunity
for wealth to give a man or a,
group control over the lives oil
others. The state is generous in
educating the most able. To be‘
sure, “ability” often includes ac—l
ceptance of the nation’s political
system (as those receiving gov—
ernment fellowships here are ‘
screened as to their associations),
and education is. in part, distorte,
ed by partisan bias. Medical carel
depends far less on ability to payl
than with us There is but onc
party, elections are meaningless
(but we should learn more aboutl
popular influence on the choice
of candidates). Religion is dis
couraged.

Practices of communist coun—
tries are such a mixture of those
we admire and those we detest
that a discerning person will call
himself neither pro—nor—amlr
communist. He will, however, see
that undiscriminating hostility is
almost sure to reentorce those
features which we should like to
see disappear,

Monmouth, To Host Midwest Trad! Meet

The Midwest Conference track
and rield championships will
be decided today and tomorrow
at Monmouth, with host school
Monmouth and defending Cham-
pion St. Olaf favored to win

individual champions, wliol
will be back to defend .their
titles, include St. Olaf’s Dave
Wee in the two mile, Jerry
Larson in the low hurdles and
Ken Hokeness in the shot and
discus.

Pioneer Ernie Rutherford and
Carleton’s Jim Cheshro, who
tied for first in the pole vault
last year, will resume their
dual in that event, and Mon-
month’s Glenn Brooks will de-
fend his broad jump title.

Grinnell has beaten both
Monmouth and St. Olaf in
dual meets this season, but
in both meets the Pioneers
depended heavily on field
event strength. Both the Scots
and the Oles should bring
better balanced teams into
the Conference competition.

Along with Grinnell, Cornell
and Carleton also have good
point potential and should hat—

they have recently shown.

Carleton will chiefly rely
on pole vaulter Chssbro and,
miler Chuck Jennings, but the
Carls will also pick up enough
other points to be a third placei
threat.

Grinnell should place Carle-
ton Peterson in the high hur-
tiles and John Edgren and pos—

i
l
sibly Peterson in the low hur—l

dles. Rutherford and Gene
Kowert should get points in
the pole vault and Rutherford
again in the javelin.

A combination of Kowert,
Dennis Asby and John Har—
tung should get a couple
of places in both the shot
and the discus. Kent Roger-
son in the high jump and Bob
Earl-ill in the broad jump

should also place. l

The mile relay team ought to
do well, and another point pos<
Sibllity is Hartung in the 440.
if Jim Fisher, Fred ‘Arnold,
Jim Cross or Chris King can
place in the 440 or half mile,
the Pioneers may be able to
present a Challenge to St. Olaf
and Monmouth since entering
the Conference in 1939, the

Pioneers have won the meet
twice, in 1043 and in 1956.

Knox, Belolt and Lawrence
didn‘t appear to be threats for
the top five places, but Beloit’s
mile relay team and quarter
miler rlodine should win their
respective events. Ripon and
Coe appear to have little chance
of getting more than a couple
of points in the meet.
