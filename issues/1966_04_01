llent Explains Executive Council
In Series of Hall Fireside Meetings

By DICK CHADY

“The ad hoc Committee on Resi-
dence Halls” was explained to Stu»
dents through a series of “fireside
chats" by SGA President Steve
Kent on Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday oi this week, Kent, ac-
companied by Associate Dean
Richard Winters and by the CofHF
and AWS Board Presidents on
their respective campuses, ex-
plained the reasons for the com-
mittee. its membership, and the
procedure it will follow

Kent explained that his Visits to
the halls had two purposes: "(1)
to dispel any possible apprehen-
sions about the recommendations
of'tlle Executive Council, and (2)
to let students know that we are
interested in their opinions, and
that they should take the time to
write out their views for the com-
mittee."

Kent explained that the commit-
tee would give equal consideration
to the opinions or students or
groups of students and to the Ex-
ecutive Council proposals. lie
added that “There is no commit
ment on anybody’s part to any
particular change or to a change
in itself,”

He said that he and Winters had
accepted their jobs as co-chairmen
with the understanding that they
were not committed to recommend
any change unless they ielt it nec-
essary,

Winters commented that the
committee was beginning its work
"without commitment to any pro-
posals" and that it would not; neces-
sarily limit itseli to the residence
hall system, but would welcome
student opinions on “any part of
student life beyond the classroom.”

In addition to Kent and Winters
as co—chairmen, the ad hoc com»
mittee is composed oi Bob Foate,
Karen Lauterbacll, Dave Shellen-
barger, Homer Norton (history),
Henry-York Steiner (English), and
Luther Erickson (chemistry).

 

The committee was created by
President Leggett to consider the
residence hall system and report
to him in May The Executive
Council (composed of Leggett,
Stauss, the five division heads and
three other faculty members) has
already made its recommendations
(see page 9 ol this week’s S&B)t

The President will consider the
reports oi both groups before mak-
ing a decision on the future or the
residence hall system.

In his talks to the halls, Kent
emphasized a need (or students to
write out their opinions and sub-

— either through one of the mem-

and every group may gain a clear
e~ understanding or what is ex

Two Girls ‘Wit-hdraw' Before Break
After General Conduct Violations

By BOB HODIERNE

Two sophomore girls, a
Main Hall resident and 3
Cleveland Hall resident, were
asked to withdraw from school
on March 12, the day before
spring vacation .

The pair had' originally
been dismissed from school
but an appeal on their part
allowed them to withdraw.

The office of the deans
states that the official reason
the two were asked to with-
draw came under the terms
of the general conduct clause
in the Student Handbook. The
clause says, in effect, that the
school may ask a student to
leave if hi5701' her‘general
conduct isn’t befitting that of
a member of the college com»
munity.

At the same time, however,
the deans say there were
specific reasons for the dis-
missal.

The Main Hall resident had
recently been reported absent
from the Quad after hours.
She was reported by an an-

 

onymous phone call to Dean
of Women Jean Sloccum.

The girl felt, however, that
this “particular charge was
not the reason l was asked to
leave, It just brought me to
their attention.”

The second girl, the Cleve-
land resident,-testified to the

deans that the Main Hall girl-L3

spent the night in question in
Cleveland Hall studying,

It was out of this incident,
say the deans, that the re
quested withdrawal grew.

The deans report that they
were convinced that the Main
girl was absent from the
Quad. Further, say the deans,
an inordinate number of stu-
dents — both student officers
and non~student officers -—
were convinced that the girl
was out of the Quad overnight.

The deans felt, therefore.
that the Cleveland girl had
lied to protect the Main girl.
The Cleveland girl was al-
ready on conduct probation
for a variety of offenses in-

Kuntz Accepts Offer at Emory U.
After Eighteen Years at Grinnell,

By PAUL R. JONES

Paul G. Kuntz (philosophy and
religion) is leaving in 1966 to take
over the position at head or the
philosophy department at Emory
University His departure comes
alter eighteen years in varied posi-
tions irom assistant protessor in
1948 to Noble Professor in 196}.

Before coming to Grinnell, Pro
lessor Kuntz held the jobs or as-
sistant to the dean at Harvard
University, and served as a min-
ister in Congregational and non-
denomiriational churches in Ver-
mont and Massachusetts. He has
had a rigorous education as an un»
dergraduate at Haveriord and as

a graduate student at Harvard Uni- .

versity where he received three de-
grees including his PhD.

Dantorth Fellow

Last January, Kuntz was award-
ed a Daniorth Cross-disciplinary
Fellowship out at 130 applications
irom throughout the United States.
This iellowship involves study at
a univer ‘ in a iield out of the
’ﬁiir‘t'léipant's‘hsdal 'l'ield. Kuntz
chose religion as his other iield,
and Emory University offered him
the post oi head or the philosophy
department to iacilate his study

When asked why he was leaving
Grinnell atter eighteen years, he
mentioned the desirability of the
offer, but he also stated that the
position involved a little more than
that. ”As tar as my relationship
with Grinnell is concerned,” he
said, “there are many closets but
no skeletons.”

Less Tension

He said that at Emory there
would be less tension since he
would be teaching only one course
per semester; he added that he
would be involved in more admin—
istrative ariairs than he was here.
He emphatically denied that this
means he is disavowing the edu

 

cational aspect. He stated that he

 

would be in a position to be of
more service not only to the school
but to the students. He has also
been concerned with his time to
work on the many publications he
has started. These include several
books and innumerable essays on

it

Pnu’i.’ a. whirl

his favorite areas: aesthetics and
order.

Kuntz stated what he thought
were the greatest changes which he
has seen since he has been here.
He classified them as “sociological
changes, changes in emphasis, and .

Those Proposals

This week the longawaited recommendations by
the Executive Council on residence hall organization
were made public (see page 9). The proposals were of
such a nature that student government leaders and the
deans were prompted to visit the halls on campus and
remind the students that the recommendations were
just that, recommendations (page 9). The SGA offi-
cials and the deans made the visits and offered the ex-
planations lest anyone should read the proposals with
out this knowledge in the front of his mind and, as a
result, storm Burling basement.

The recommendations are terrible. We don’t feel
they represent a very accurate picture of life on North
Campus. It is assumed that anti-intellectualism runs
rampant now on North Campus. If the Executive Coun-
cil thinks that their proposals are going to make heal-
thy, normal twentyayear old men more intellectual than
they are now they are displaying a remarkable naivte.
What the faculty calls a problem on North Campus is
simply the normal behavior of any group like that #
and even at that it’s not as bad as the pictures painted
by its critics.

One particular proposal that we want to discuss
here is their proposal for the establishment of freshmen
dormitories on North Campus. We could spend all of
this April Fools’ Day discussing all of the proposals but
time and space prohibit this. ,

At the start of 1964435 freshmen dormitories on
South Campus were eliminated. Recently the AWS
Board conducted a survey to see what feeling existed
now on South Campus about freshmen dorms. The re—
sults were overwhelmingly in favor of filing freshmen
dorms in the college archives and forgetting a ho ut
them.

Not so with the Executive Council. They would
segregate the freshmen from uperclassmen on North
Campus. No more humanities and historical studies
seminars, no more help on scheduling, no more help in
getting into the swing of Grinnell‘s social life,

Further, I think it would create a new concept of
freshmen in the minds of upperclassmen. Under the
current system freshmen make friends not only with
other freshmen but with upperclassmen. They make
friends by constant, day-today contact in the hall. The
chance of friendships being created between freshmen
and upperclassmen under the Executive Council’s sys-
tem is slim indeed. Rather, freshmen, by being treated
differently by the school. will be treated differently by
the students. Now, after the first few weeks, they are
treated as equals. Under the new proposed system we
think it is inevitable that freshmen will be treated as
lnferiors.

The rest of the proposals are certain to receive
widespread attention in the next few weeks. We are

'hterested in what the students feel about the proposals ‘

and the so~called North Campus problem. Next week
we will distribute a survey about the problem and so-
lutions. We will appreciate it if you will take time to
fill it out and return it to us.

The Grudge Pot

Most people are merely schizophrenic, but Mar-
shall Musier had at least three personalities. This
condition in itself would not have bothered Marshall,
but for the life of him he could not decide which
one he pl-elen-ed.

Sometimes Marshall was a Quaker. Then he was
very quiet and serious, and everyone sneered at
him. The sueers made him feel important. superior,
and persecuted, and so he was very happy.

Sometimes he was a Catholic. This stage oc-
curred every Friday. when Marshall ate plate alter
plate of white perch at Billy‘s Diner (all you can
eat for $1.35). He even ate the bones.

At other times he was a Unitarian. He swore at
the minister and played golf on Sunday mornings
and felt very unholy and free.

Actually, the Quaker liked the Catholic best, but
the Catholic had a iondness for the Unitarian. Of
course, the Unitarian adored the Quaker.

Like Joe Christmas, Marshall also could not de-
cide to which race he belonged. Sometimes, when
he looked Into a mirror at his wan oily white skin,
he knew that he could not be That ugly und so
thought he was a Negro. Other times he was proud
that he did not have to buy skinrwhiteners and that
he was a pure Caucasian. But, when sneaking
through the dark streets and back alleys to Billy’s
Diner, he felt all the scheming and superhuman
subtlety or an Oriental.

The Catholic disliked the Oriental. though. and
often would not go to dinner with him. He liked
the Caucasian. The Unitarian liked the Negro in him
self, but he admired the Orienla] in the Quaker.
The Quaker loathed the Caucasmn in himself but

did not mind it in the Unitarian. In fact. he almost
liked it there.

The Catholic Oriental usually was a good Demu<
oral and voted for Mayor Daley (he had lorgoueu
the guy's real first name» ioul- straight times. al-
though he joined the Goldwater enthusxasts in 1964.
The Unitarian Caucasian Democrat almost killed
him for that, (or he believed in eternal party loyal-
ty, but the Catholic Negro Republican said, “Hog-
wash," and let it go at that.

Marshall made the mistake of marrying in 1959,
which was a bad year In other ways. Marshall had
revealed only his Quaker Caucasian Republican sell
to petite and lovely Molly, and since each of these
despised the others, he had a tough go oi it. Then,
one night in 1961. he weakened as he was falling
asleep and became l Unitarian Negro Democrat
just as Molly rolled over and looked at him.

Molly was disgusted and went home to her moth-
er, Eventually. she remarried a plumber, who was
a permanent Hungarian Baptist Conservative.

Marshall was deeply upset by this failure, and
in 1965 he ran off to theoircus in hope of ﬁnding
reconciliation with himself. He became the star of
the sideshow and changed personalities on the hour
to the sound of a huge gong. and for a while he
was content.

But Marshall Muster fell in love with the lady
snake charmer, who demanded that he become 3
Jewish Socialist. In his heroic attempt to satisfy his
lover, Marshall burst a blood vessel in his brain and
passed swiftly away. His body was cremated, and
the ashes were scattered to where the four winds
blow.

To the Editor:

After reading the sob editorial
or March 11th. “the gross unwlll
ingness bi Goddard to cooperate
with the son" is very clear to me.
Not only do you “make mistakes in
reporting" you also write Very
slanted. biased editorials.

In his speech. JeiTy Goddard
correctly attacked efforts to effect
change “by stirring the students
to an irrational ireuzy or by play-
ing political ipolsy with the col-
lege administration.” Unlike many
people on this campus, he is can
able of realizing that “the par-
ents, the alumni. the trustees, the
faculty" exist as well as the ﬂu
dents.

However, the son is right about
one thing: Goddard did maintain
the status quu (without defending
it) and for a definite reason. His
aim was clearly in establish “a
year of relative calm in student-
administration relations" (unlike
the son, 1 shall quote in context).
I can only speculate on his rear
sons for seeking this calm, but
perhaps one reason is that Grin-
nell does have a new president, a
president who might appreciate
not being jumped on with wild «lev
mantis d ring his first year here.
Another reason might be that good
government consists in part of
slowing down, of occasionally
withdrawing [mm the sound and
the fury.

The son Said that Goddard is
proud of the job he has done this
year, and he should be. for he has
done what he set out to do 7 and
on his own publiclysiaied terms
he has not failed. Perhaps his
terms are not satisfactory to the
sen; nevertheless, Jerry was uu~
her no obligation to conduct his
onlce as the sat-b saw fit.

Perhaps the most perceptive ob-

servation made in a very fine
speech was that the newspaper
staff “should spend less time gaz-
ing at comets and picket lilies and
more time considering their re-
sponsibilities to their readers." It
is a statement whch many. runny
people here agree with.

3&6 Pulls Through:
Benches on Campus

To the Editor:

I wish to praise 3&6 for their
wisdom, their generosity, in plac-
ing two benches on the held be-
tween the women's gym and the
library. it isn‘t often that 8&6 is
praised, but [his act oi theirs. if
none else, proves. be yond any
doubt, [he wcnh oi that organiza»
tion.

Now several weeks ago it was
protested that Gl-inooll provides no
place rol- quiet conversation among
students. The grill was accused of
being too restaurantish, the South
Lounge for being used for study.
and so on. These two old benches
are a beginning to the end of this
deﬁciency.

Now. In the midst oi nature,
there 15 a haven [or conversation.
However. two benches are not
enough. The school should pur-
chase nine or ten more. In this
way. one of the major problems or
the school will be solved, a study
of nature will be encouraged, and
I believe, the value of Grinnell
will be doubled.

The statement is in error: the

SCARLET AND BLACK

Steiner Directs 'Glass Menagerie’,
Comments on Method and Hopes

BY MARY MALCOLM

"Interest in drama is basic to
interest in literature,” according
to Henry-York Steiner (English),
who makes his debut in directing
with the opening ol The Glass Men-
agerie next week.

Steiner’s production will be
presented next Tuesday, Wednesr
day, and Thursday at s p.m. in
the Arena Theatre. Cast members
are Karyn Zimmerman, Debbie Ab-
bot. Ken Hicks and Chuck Burns.

Steiner chose The Glass Men-
ngerie because at its combined li-
terary valtte, poetic tone, and
small cast. He said he felt a small
cast would be easier to work with
tor an uninitiated director.
'Becanse \Villiains’ play is none
realistic. Steiner (eels that de
sign props, costumes and lighting
are lett to the imagination of the
director. “when you read a play,
you lurnish the costumes, props,
and set with your imagination," he
commented. “One gets the basic
training in imagination through the
study of literature.”

“I think that l have directed the
play in the way an English protes-
sot‘ would and not someone trained
in drama,” Stener said, “l‘ve
paid little or no conscious attention
to what i assume is taught to and
learned by prolessional directors.
rm doing it in terms or training
in a literary approach to drama.”

Also relatively new to the theatre
is Steiner's technical director,
lreshman Kit Leder. The members
of the cast are all veterans, how-
ever. Miss Zimmerman appeared
in The Bourgeousie, while Miss Ab-
hott had roles in Virginia Wolf and
See How They Run. Hicks was also
in See How They Run, as well as
Antigone. Burns was in Oedipus
Rex and Tea and Sympathy.

Steiner decided to direct the
play at the suggestion oi Richard
Meyer (speech and theatre), whom
Steiner described as “helpful and
very tactful” in the actual direc-
tion oi The Glass Menagerie.

“Mr. Meyer was there and would

 

help it I needed him, but I wanted
to do it myself,” Steiner said.

He feels that his set design, use
of music, and stage position are
“natural.” He added. “I’ve tried
to direct the play to conform to

words exist Without the actors,”

and Karen Zimmerman have

the female roles in Henry-York Steiner's [English] produc-
tion at Tennessee William's play‘The Glass Menagerie. The
play explores the relationship of an ambitious mother _
played by Miss Zimmerman -— with her shy crippled and

restless son.

my reading. I almost feel, when
I go to the theatre, that the play
comes out more thealrically than

in my reading.” /

“It it is a success—it people
lose themselves in it and are con-
vinced by it, it the tact that they
are sitting in a theatre disappears
—the credit belongs entirely to the
way in which the actors present
the playwright’s words.”

“The director is a mediator be-
tween the playwright and the ac—
tors, and brings them to that we,
sentation. The actors need the die
rector, and the director needs the
play.”

Steiner said his only surprise
in directing the play came when
he was casting. With 40 students
tiying out tor {our roles, Steiner
ending up selecting an entirely dif—
ferent cast from those students
whom he originally had had in
mind.

The Glass Menagerie, considered
to be one or Wllliams' best plays,
explores the relationship of an am-
bitious mother with her shy, crip-
pled and restless, sensitive son.

Hustle Down To The

1i 7 Brood

By JUDY scorr

SGA began its push tor more
student involvement Wednesday at
a coffee hour called by Steve
Kent to present various organiza-
tions to the campus.

Nine representatives spoke at
the atternooii event, each one
stressing that their particular or—
gaulzations needed more help and
more Willingstoswork members.

Tom Lane, president or the in-
ternational Relations Club, ex-
pressed one general attitude ot the
group in saying he “couldn’t un-
derstand this year’s amount of
apathy."

Dan Bucks of Young Democrats
declared his irritation with people
who oIIered their help until asked

Grinnell as a small Midwestern

A new political outlook is in the
making for YD‘s according to
Bucks. Campaigns are to move
“more towards the intellectual
grain with more valuable dis
cussions than What has been done
in the past." In the planning stage
are discussions with Joseph Wall

South.

Cornellians Decrie lack of Power;
Declare Legislation ‘Non Existent'.

3 “Student Council is. a deceit. At t posal that "an open dorm policy

Cornell, student government has
a power to do anything but ex-
press opmion and allocate the
budget,” said Cornell College's
Student Council President Trayer
at a gathering of 300 students and
faculty.

The meeting occurred after a
hapel talk which questioned the
administration’s propaganda for
attracting prospective students
with "government by the stu-
dents” when in the speaker’s opin<
ion, such government did not
exist. He declared that if the
council does not receive more
authority it should disband.

The new council president said
that while there were a ‘few sig-
nificant changes that had oc-
curred, 1 submit that they do
not seem worth the effort of meet-
ing once a week during two sem-
esters." He stated that legislation
was “non—existence in Cornell Stu-
dent government."

When as dean was questioned
during the meeting about dress
standards, he said that no changes
ad been made because of a lack
of communication between stu»
dens and administration. As to
who makes recommendations for
.eform, the dean said that since
the faculty does not concern it-
self with the daily student life, all
decisions are made by the presi<
dent through the deans.

Open Dorms —Ciosed issue

. "The matter of open dorms is a
closed issue,” declared Coe’s pres»
ident in an open letter to the cam-
pusr His reason was that “sev-
,ral excellent colleges which
have open dorms have greatly re-
stricted the program in the light
of experience, or completely
bandoned the policy,"

The open letter was an answer
to the Coe Student Council's pro-

 

be instituted on a trial basis for
four weeks in the spring term."
The suggested hours were 1-4 on
Sunday afternoons. Coe already
has no hours for senior women on
Friday and Saturday nights.

Beloit Civil Rights

The Beloit Civil Rights Interest
Group is planning to enlist stu-
dents in an effort to help the dis-
advantaged townspeople of Eeloit
help themselves. For the last two
weeks a task force has traveled
to various service organizations
in Eeloit finding out what they do,
their needs, and what role the
college students could play in the
community.

On a tour of the community, stu.
dents reported individuals living
in squalor as had as the slums of
the large cities. Four or more
families live in facilities that were
intended for only one family. In
South Beloit, people are housed
in chicken coops,

Beloit's varsity lettermen club
has already built a $1200 basket-
ball court in an economically de-
pressed part of Beloit, They also
built a baseball diamond which
the city refused to build.

Parsons Blackout

Two weeks ago Parsons College
faced a blackout when an elec-
trical storm caused all the power
to be cut off. Without the lights
all Hell broke loose.

A car of boys drove around the
campus yelling “let's go get ’em”
and moments later hundreds of
boys swarmed into the girls’
halls. They broke down doors,
tr e m pie cl proctors, ransacked
rooms and stole articles of Cloth-
ing. One girl reported that $67
worth or clothing had been taken
from her room.

a small student-lit fire.

God Is Dead After Surgery Fails

Possible Cause Is
Cardiac Affliction

Ed Note: Below is part at an
article that appeared in the moth
odist youth magazine Motive. it
has been reprinted elsewhere, sev-
eral of the papers calling it satire.
We're not so sure.

ATLANTA, Ga. w God, creator
or the universe, principal diety or
the world’s Jews, ultimate reality
of Christians, and most eminent
or all divinities died late yesterday
during major surgery undertaken
to correct a massive diminishing
iiitluence. His exact age is not
known, but close triends estimate
that it greatly exceeded that or all
othei extant beings,

Cardiac Insufficiency

The cause of death could not be
immediately determined, but the
deity’s surgeon, Thomas J. Altizer,
36, of Emory University in Atlanta,
indicated possible cardiac insur-
ticiency. Assisting Dr. Altizer in
the unsuccessful surgery were Dr,
Patti Van Buren at Temple Uni-
versity, Philadelphia; Dr. William
Hamilton oi Colgate-Rochester, Ro-
chester, N. Y,, and BL Gabriel
Vahanian of Syracuse University,
Syracuse, N. Y.

Ofﬁcial Disclosure

Word of tiie death. long rumored,

was otii‘cially disclosed to reporters

 

at two minutes betore midnight ai-
ter a lull day or mounting anxiety
and ,the comings and goings or ec—
clesiastical dignitaries.

Johnson ‘Profoundly Upset’

in Johnson city, Tex., president
Johnson was described by aides
as “profoundly upset.” He at once
directed that all flags should be
at hall-staff until after the lunet‘al.
The First Lady and the two presi-
dential'daughters. Luci and Lynda,
were understood to have wept open-
ly. Both houses ol Congress met in
Washington at noon today and
promptly adjourned after passing
a joint resolution expressing “grtei
and great respect tor the departed
spiritual leader." Senator Wayne
Morse, Democrat or Oregon. oh-
jected on the grounds that the
resolution violated the principle or
separation of church and state,
but he was Overruled by Vice
President Hubert Humphrey, who
remarked that “this IS not a time
for partisan politics."
‘Olll or Misery’

Reaction from the world’s great
and from the man in the street was
nnitormly incredulous, “At least he
is out at his misery,” commented
one housewiie in an Elmira, N Y.
supermarket. "I can’t believe it,”
said the Right Rev. Horace W. B,
Donegdil, Protestant Episcopal BisA
hop of New York. In Paris, Presi-
dent de Gaulle in a 30-second ap-
pearance on national television

 

proclaimed “God is dead! Long
live the i-epnblici Long live
France!” News of the death was
included in a one-sentence state-
ment, without comment, on the 3rd
page of lzvestia, oltlcial organ of
the Soviet Government. The pass-
ing or God has not been disclosed

to the 800 million Chinese who live
behind the bamboo curtain.

Truman: Darrin Shame

Public reaction in this countiy
was perhaps summed up by an
elderly retired streetcar conductor
in Passaict N. J., who said: “I
have never met himY ol course.
Never even saw himr But from
what I heard, I guess he was a real
nice lellow. Tops." From Indepen-
dence. M0,, tormer President Harry
S. Truman, who received the news
in his Kansas City barbershop,
said: “I'm always sorry to hear
somebody is dead. It's a damn
shame." in Gettysburg, Pa., lot-in-
er President Dwight D. Eisenhower
released through a military aide
the toilowiog statement; “Mrs, Eis-
enhower joins me in hearttelt Symr
pathy to the family and many
friends at the late God, He was, I
always relt, a tone tor moral good
in the universe. Those at us who
were privueged to know him ad-
mired the prooity at his character,
the breadth or his compassion, the
depth at his intellect, Generous al-
most to a iault, his many acts of
kindness will never be torgotten,

 

it is a very great loss indeed. He
will be missed.”

Death Not Unexpected

Dr. Altizer, God's surgeon, in an
exclusive interview with The Times,
stated this morning that the death
was “not unexpected." "He had
been ailing [or some time," Dr.
Altizer said, “and lived inueh Iongr
er than most ot us thought possir
ble.” He noted that the death of
God, had, in tact, been premaa
turely announced in the last cen-
tury by the tamed German surgeon,
Nietzsche, Nietzsche who was in»
sane the last 10 years ot his lite,
may have contused “certain Symp-
toms ot morbidity in the aged pa-
tient with actual death, a mistake
any busy surgeon Will occasionally
make." Dr. Altizer suggested, “God
was an excellent patient, complir
ant, cheer-ml, alert. Every comfort
modern science could provide was
made available to him. He did not
softer—he iusr, as it were, slipped
out at our grasp."

Faculty Visit Schools

Three Griiinell faculty members
spoke at five high schools during
spring break as part of the Iowa
Visiting Scientist Program.

The three were Edgar Rt Mul-
lins, Jr., associate professor of
mathematics: William A, Nevill,
asactaie professor of chemistry:
and Beryl E, Clottelter, associate
protessor ot physics.

PPPE Book Announced

nespoiiers of Democracy by
Clark Mollenhotf has been chosen
as the Program in Practical Po-
litical Education’s Book of the
Month ror April. The book con-

vestigations that have made head-
lines during the past few years.

Mollenlioif, rather a latter-day
miickraker, is concerned about
the extent of decay in American
democracy but “what makes Mr.
Mollenhoff's thesis so surprising
is the picture it reveals or high-
and middle - level collusion,
wrong-headedness, colossal arrow
gaiice, and sometimes shocking
Corruption.” The “characters” ofi
the book are Billie Sol Estes, Sec-
retary or Delense McNamara,
Bobby Baker (and Carol Tyler
and Ellie Rometscll), Otto Otepka,
Under-Secretary oi Delense Ros-
well Gilpatric, Navy Secretary
Fred Korth, and Senator John Wil-
liams —- all no doubt dear to the
hearts of those in PPPE.

Copies of the book may be ob-
tained from William Vandcrpool
(speech and theater).

Exec. (ouncil Proposes Frosli Hulls,
Room Brown 5, Rule Enforcement

Ed. Note: Following is the list of proposals
that the Executive Council handed over to the
ad huc committee on hall reorganization, The
recommendations are only suggestions and will
not necessarily go into effect. Joseph Wall
(history), a member of the executive council.
pointed out that the ad hoc Committee will
carefully scrutinize the list of proposals and
is under no obligation to adopt them.

L The Setting Up of Freshman halls,

We recommend that freshman halls be or-
ganized on both North and South Campus.
Each freshman hall would be under the su-
pervision of an adult resident who would be
a representative of the student dean. Juniors
and seniors, selected by the college, would
live in the freshman halls and act as Coun<
selors; each iipperclasmen given that func-
tion would be responsible for 8 to in students,
and Wmlld be remunérated for his work.

The uppei-class counselors, under the su-
pel‘vision of the adult residents, would be i
sponslble [or rule enforcement. One can
selor in each hall would be selected by the
student dean to act as pi‘esulent of the hall;
this counselor would sit on the CofI-lP or
the AWS Board. and would appomt other
counselors to hall offices

2. Assignment to Uppei-class Halls

Students would be assigned to uppei-class
halls by the student deans at the end of the
fieshman year. The student deans would en-
deavor to honor requests at groups (oi ironi
Z to 8 students each) who wish to enter the
some upperclass hall, to the degree to which
circumstances permit.

3. structure at Upperclass Halls.

Tile Council suggests two possible alterna-
tive plans, both of which have met with sup-
port:

Version A:

The present hail system would coniiiuie,
both on North and South Campus. Greater
mobility would be encouraged, though not en-
forced, on North Campus. Some provisions
would be made to allow groups of from 2 to
3 upperclassmen who wish to join together in
one hall to do so, subject to the approval or
the student dean.

The rollowing changes are recommended
for North Campus hall government: The gov-
erning committee of each hall would consist
of a President and Vice President plus a
number nf members named by the hall pi'esh
(lent (in the manner of South Campus “Baf-
ﬂeboartl”). This committee would be re-
sponsible for rule enforcement, and would
meet regularly with the adult resident of the
hall for Consultation and advice,

Other oliicers may be elected by the ball
(as for example a social chairman and ilitra<
murals chairman), but would not form part
of this committee. Adult head residents liv-
ing in the ’halls would endeavor to make
themselvesavatlable to advise the governing
body of the hall and to give it needed sup-
port.

Version B:

Room drawings would be held each year
on North and South Campus. Students would
thus rotate among the halls; hall presidents
would be elected at: large on both campuses
Other hall Officers would be named and elect<
ed in accord with the procedures now preval-
ent on South Campus

Men's halls would be governed by com-
mittees such as those described ln version A.
Some provisions would be made to allow
groups of students to join together and be
placed in the same hall; these groups would
not exceed 3 students each, and their place
merit would be made subject to the availa-
hility of accommodations and to the approval
of the student deans.

4. Provisions for Certain Upperclass students.

The Council hopes that some special pro-
visions may be made for senior and junior
students who wish to form interest groups.
or have in mind worthwhile residence ar-
rangements which ditier irom the present
residence hall structure. Such provisions
inigiit include housing of groups of men or
groups of women in college houses (such as
1127 Park and the White House), the use of
wings oi dormitories for interest groups, or
the use of off-campus housing. it would be
understood, or course. that any such plans
would be subject to limitations based on the
availability oi space and the need of using
available space; they may also require the
moving of some other students in order to ac-
commodate interest groups.

it is also hoped that the provisions allow-
ing groups oi up to 3 students to enter the
same hall (No 2) or to stay together (No. 313),
will encourage the formation of interest
"groups.” Any specific and rigid attempt to
plan for “interest groups” seems unfeaSible
at the present time, given the uncertainty as
it) how much desire there exists for this kind
of arrangement. This issue, however, should
be given continued attention: it is hoped that
moves in the direction of “interest groups"
will lead to an improvement in the intellec—
tual climate of the campus.

5 Student government

We recommend that the functions of the
student senate as presently defined in iesi»
device liall government be taken over by the
AWS Board and Coil-lP, sitting jointly.

The AWS Board and the CofHP, sitting
as committees and dispensing with the pres-
eni trial procedure used in the pri ‘
courts, should take over the responslb
of the present primary courts. '

The present Student High Court. the Facul-
ty Committee on Student Affairs, and the
Dean's Committee would function as at pres—
ent. Some pmVlslon should be made for the
automatic review by the Dean’s Committee
of all cases handled by student Courts.

Gl Other Matters

Every effort should be made to provide
increased study and recreational space in the
residence halls. Adult head residents should
be employed ior uppei-class halls; their role
would be advisory rather than disciplinary,
but they would make themselves available to
hall presidents and committees and aid in
rule enforcement when called upon.

The role of faculty advisers to freshmen
and sophomores needs to be studied and de-
lined. in particular, more effort and stress
needs to be placed on the advising of sopho—
mores, who are all too often forgotten at the
time at which they are making crucial der
cisions. (Presence ot academically interested
adult head residents in the halls may to some
degree alleviate the problem.)

Lives With family
Outside Kohlewadi

By DONALD ROGUE
Ever since I came to lndia. peo-
ple have been telling me that the
place to see the real india is not
‘ in Bombay, or in Delhi, or even
in Alnnednagar, btti in the thrills
ands and thousands of small Vil-
lages in which the majority of the
people live, in order to iollow this
advice. i have made inany' at-
tempts Io iitid out what village
lite is really like.
i have had long discussions with
the college boys in the hostel abottt
’their ltomes and the way their
iainiiies live. I have also spent a
lot of time travelling with the pro-
iessors from the Rural Lite De-
velopment Department as these
men try to organize and help the
people in some of the villages
near Ahmednagar.

However, neither of these meth-
ods of iinditig out abottt village
liie ts any substitute ior really gt}
ing to a village and living there
for a short time. So, a couple oi
weeks ago, when a college boy in-
vtted me to accompany him to his
home village, l was glad to ace
cept his invitation.

Biked In

In order to get to the village,
Namdeo Waman, (my host), Ma-
hadco Pawar, another boy irom
the hostel, and I first had to go
to a totvn called Snagamner by
btis. There we rented bicycles and
rode five more miles to the Vil-
lage oi Kohlewadi, Cycling and
walking are the only ways to get
to this village of about 1000 peo-
ple. Actually, we had to go about
a mile past the village.

Unlike most farmers, who live in
town and Walk to their farmlands
which might be several miles out-
side of me town, the Wamans live
outside the main part or the vil-
lage on their own land.

Namneo’s father owns 35 acres
of land, on which he primarily
grows the lndian crops or bajari
and jawarii His 35 acres make
him a big landowner in this part
of india However; drought has hit
this farm, as it has all the usable

land iit this area. Dryrlaud iattn.
ing is not as productive as it once
was, wells are going dry, and irri-
gation is becoming more diiiicnlt.

Home of Stone

The Waman home was made
partly oi stone. There is a large
stone quarry irear Kohlwadi, sti
stones are cheap and plentittti and
are iiieretore the best building ma-
terials. The stone walls were cov-
ered with wet mild, which when
dry gave the wall a smooth sur-
face. The root was made of tile
shingles that had been laid over-
the tree branches which covered
the top of the house. The floor
was dried mud,

The house consisted of two rooms
with a small leaneto built on to
the back ot the house. The lean-to
was used ior storage. The two
regular rooms measured about 15
by 20 ieet each. One oi these rooms
contained the kitchen. Here the
women of the house prepared the
meals on top oi open iii-es.

Tile other room Was the living

-room, dining room, bedroom, and

worship center all combined, in
this room the iamily ate their
meals, said their prayers to the
Hindu gods, and slept at night.
There were no chails 01‘ furniture
or any kind in titis or any other
room. Eating, conversing, and
sleeping were all done on blankets
spread out on the iloor. There
Wele no bathrooms in this house
ior the great otit-oidoors provided
all the facilities which anyone
might need.

Eleven People—Two Rooms
Eleven iamiiy members call this
two-room house home. They in
clude Namtleo’s grandmother, his

mother, his tather, two older broth- '

ers. who are married, the wives

and cliiltlten oi these two brotitcrs,
a younger brother, and Nantdco
himseii.

With the exception oi Namdeo,
ito member or the iamily has more
than a primary school education.
The iamily cooperates in the farm-
itrg oi the 35 acres of laird. The
tour bttllocks owned by the lainily
pull the wooden implements that
are used ior plowing, planting, and
cultivating. One cow and several
goats supply the iamily with milk.
Very close by, two oi Naindeo’s
uncles live with their iamilies on
their otvii 35 acres oi land.

Rest After Trip

When we reached the Walnan
home, we._all sat down on the
iloor oi the all - purpose ltvtng
room to rest ourselves from the
bicycle journey. Soon the women
had cooked something for us to
eat.

The him they prepared was cer—
tainly delicious, but even as much
as I liked It, I was unable to eat
hall the amount the male meni-
bers of the family ate. I had
warned the tamtly before i came
to cut down on the amount OI
spices in the iood they served to
me, and l was careitti to use hala-
zone tablets in my water. Othetv
Wise, I was able to eat the same
things as everybody else: chapae
tis, rice. dal, bhaje, and the many
other varieties of Indittn tood that
were served.

Sat Crass-Legged

We sat cross - legged on the
blankets. and metal bowls of food
were placed in from oi us. No sil-
verware was used; the fingers
work better ior eating anyway. Of
course, only men ate with me. Ac-
cording to Hindu custom, women
are not permitted to eat in lront

 

of men, so the women of the
house had to eat later at a sepure
ate meal.

Alter the meal, we sat in front
at the house relaxtrtg together. A
mantle was lit to keep away the
approaching darkness. The naigh~
boring relatives came over to sit
With us. Not much conversation
took place, but I could tell that
they enjoyed each other's come
pany. since nobody could speak
English except the two college
boys arid myseli. I had a lot or
chances to use the few Marathi
phrases that I had learned. How»
ever. despite the handicap oi not
being able to talk directly with
these people, i was able to have
a lot oi inn with them, especially
the younger children,

‘Til Sankrat’

This night was the time oi celer
bl‘atlon of “Tll Snnkrat,” one of
the many iamily holidays or the
Hindus. Small sweets, called
“til.” were passed out by the mem-
bers oi the iamily. The younger
members knelt down In front of
their elders and touched their heads
to the older person's feet, as they
said “God bola,” which means
“Speak sweetly” or “Forget any
quarrels we have had this past
yearl", At the same time the
younger person gives some sweets
to the person he is honoring. The
elder person in return blesses the
younger one by wishing trim the
best tor the coming year.

Played Hearts

After the sweets had been
passed out, we decided to play a
game of hearts with the playing
cards I had brought from the col-
lege. The two college boys, two
village farmers, and l participat-
ed in the game. We were not able
to hold a conversation with each

 

other. but we could emoy each
others company while playing a
simple game. All oi us had a good
time.

Slept in Shed

AIIEK the game was over, we
all settled down for a welconle‘
sleep. The women went to sleep
iii the house. Some of the men had
to sleep outside near the bajari
stack to make sure no one would
chute and steal any oi the grain.
The rest oi the men slept in the
bullock shed This shed was sim-
ply a wooden irame with branch.
es spread over the top to keep the
rain out. However, since this was
not the monsoon season and there
tore there was not mttclr possibility’
oi rain, the bullocks were kept
outside and we had the shed in
ourselves.

Although the Waman home is
certainly not as secluded as many
homes are in other parts oi lndia.
one certainly does get a ieeitng
oi being away irom the rest oi
Civilization. No radio blares in
ones ears telling about what has
been happening during the last 24
hours. Tire mail only comes once
or twice a week.

Bustle Far Away

Events like War with Pakistan
and the death of Prime Minister
Shastri have little impact on these
people. The bustling activity that
is taking place in the rest oi the
world seems very tar away.

That night, as i lay in the but
lock shed looking out at the stars
shining overhead, I couldn't help
but enjoy the calmness and peace-
tulness that surrounded me. ND
wonder these village iarmers are
somewhat leery oi stepping into
modern soCiety With all its prob-
lems and complexities.

um, property destruction and
attempted illegal entry into
the Quad.

The Main girl was not on
probation and, according to
her, her only offense while at
Grinnell was a charge of ties»
truction of property during
Spring Riot last year.

The girl said “i was as
tounded. My reaction was
there was nothing I could do
about it.” She went on to say
that she didn’t think it was
fair in light of her record that
she should be asked to with-
draw.

The Clevelalld girl was also
surprised at the action saying
“I had no idea whatsoever
that this was cooling.”

The deans, however, say
the girls had been told in ad»
vance that they were in jeop-
ardy of being dismissed from
school.

Therefore, the record of
the two girls and this final
incident were the reasons for

their forced withdrawal.

The deans’ office also
stressed that they alid the
Faculty Committee on Stu»
dent Affairs had talked the
case over with a number of
students before coming to

- their decision,

Both girls indicated that
they are considering reapply-
ing to Grinnell for the second
semester next year. The indi—
cation from the deans’ office
was that anyone has a right
to reapply for admission after
they had been dismissed.

STANDARD

SERVICE

 

F

By Steve Casey

The Pioneer athletic scene has been struck by a
critical controversy over the issuing of letters Do peo-
ple deserve letters by merely participating or must
they meet some standards of performance? This is
something which can be easily overemphasized, but is
a nuisance that must be cleared up Coach Terry Moore
of the wrestling team happened to be the center of the
dispute, but it really could have happened to any of
the coaches.

When Moore was the wrestling coach at Grinnell
for two years after he graduated, the letters were
awarded on the basis of points the wrestler scored He
had to win a certain number to get his letter How-
ever, this was not inflexible: for instance, a senior who
had wrestled for three years with a good attitude
would probably still get a letter even if he was short
of his quota of points, but was straight-forwards

Moore then went to the Peace Corps and came
back after two years to resume his coaching at Grin-
nelll In the meantime Coach Bowers had been the
wrestling coach and had started anew, systemnHe de:
cided to award letters to anyone who stayed with the
team and filled a weight class for the whole year.

When Moore came back he justifiably felt the
wrestlers were still on the same point system that he
had always known at Grinnell. So when the letters
were issued he set the standard at a certain amount of
points and three of the members did not make it so
were not issued letters. After these boys, who were
used to Bowers‘ system, complained, Terry talked with
Coach Bowers and found out what had been happen-
ing.

Although not entirely pleased by the Bowers' sys-
tem, he did not want to make a big issue of it since
he will not be the coach next year. So he awarded the
three letters,

What will happen next year when there will be
another coach? Will it go back to Coach Moore’s sys-
tem or remain as it is? De we want to have fewer but
more first-rate lettermen or more that include people
not so good?

This is something the coaches must decide — and
tell the athletes about. With two new coaches coming
next year to Grinnell, it becomes even more import-
ant Let us hope We never see such misunderstanding
between the coach and players again.

Three Pioneer wrestlers, Gary Wilson, Ken Stub-
ler, and John Sharpe, ran into some tough luck when
they traveled to Mankato State for the NCAA small
college wrestling tournament. The faculty athletic rep-
resentative had f ' ed to send 1n the form showing the
three grapplers had th miniiniim grade- point neces-
sary in NCAA competition.

Although the Pioneers had paid their entry fees,
they could not wrestle. Even when President Leggett
telephoned to say the faculty representative had just
made a mistake and the Pioneers were not trying to
imitate the Ivy League, the NCAA representative said
it was too late to do anything,
