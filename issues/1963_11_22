Young Dems Sponsor Conference
To Consider Shaff Plan Sunday

Dave Evans, President of
the Grinnell Young Democrats,
has announced plans for the
antieshaff Plan Conference and
. orkshop to be held on cam-
pus this Sunday. The confer-
ence is sponsored by the Young
Democratic Clubs of Iowa and
by the Grinnell College Young
Democrats. All sessions will be
held in Younker Lounge and
will be open to the college com-
munity at no charge.

The Shaff Plan is a proposed
form of reapportionment that
has been passed by two con-
Secutive sessions of the Iowa
Legislature. Iowans will go to
the polls on December 3 to
register their approval or dis-
approval.

The Iowa Young Demo-
crats have openly opposed

the shaft proposal. They
have contended that the new
legislation will merely estab-
lish a rural-dominated House
and will continue to allow a
small percentage of the pop-
ulation to block the efforts of
an underrepresented major-
lty.

Sunday's Conference will
concern pre<election and elec-
tion day tactics to be employed
by the Anti-Shaft forces. Fea-
tured will be speeches by
Frank Nye, 'rssociate Editor of
the Cedar Rapids Gazette,
Vern Davis and Jack Lewis.
President and Treasurer re-
spectively of the Iowa Feder»
ation of Labor. AFLVCIO, and
C. Edwin Gilmour, (political
science) member of Iowans
Against the Shﬂff Plan.

Face Lining ‘

“ Today’s issue bf the Scarlet and Black should be
a milestone in the history of that publication, as for
the first time in 43 years it is not being printed at the
Grinnell Herald Register, ,

. .The News Printing Company (Newton Daily News)
has taken over as printer of the 5&8, as we feel that
we can substantially improve the printing quality of
the S&B by making this move.

The News Company utilizes a different and
better process in reproducing pictures than the
H-R; it offers different and more readable type
faces; it uses a different type of press.

! The typeface which is utilized in the regular body
type of this issue is slightly larger than that which

ave previously been used. It is a type often recom-
[mended for readibility.

i ' During the next semester we will experiment
With the use of color and with a whiter, higher quality
' paper. \ ‘

As this issue illustrates, the S&B has already un-
dergone a “face-lifting,” and more changes will un-
doubtedly occur before we‘re through. Your com-
ments are welcome.

 

Friday. November 12. I963

 

It has been one of the fundamental rights in
this country as guaranteed by Article I of the
Bill of Rights that ”Congress shall make no
law . abridging the freedom of speech or
the press; . . .” However it is with deep con—
cern that I look upon a number of recent ac-
tions taken by various government agencies,
in particular by the Senate Internal Security

subcommittee and the Federal Communica-
tions Commission, which raise the important
question as in whether or not this basic right
will continue to remain an actuality as op-
posed to meaningless words on a sheet of his-
torical paper.

   

Within the past few months a“ non-profit
radio network known as the Pacifica Founda-
tion has been under fire by both of these gov-
ernmental agencies. Pacifica, which consists
of three stations — WEALFM in New York
City (for which, incidentally, I had the priv-
ilege of working and am therefore able to
speak about the foundation with some personal
knowledge), KPFK in Los Angeles and KPEA-
KPFB in Berkeley, California — is supported
through the voluntary contributions of its
listeners.

The Pacifica Foundation's difficulties with
the government appear to have begun approxi-
mately a year ago when it broadcast a pro-
gram featuring an ex—FBI agent who was
quite critical of J. Edgar Hoover, the director
of the FBI. In January of this year the Sen<
ate Internal Security subcommittee conducted
hearings into alleged “Communist infiltration"
of the Pacifica network,

At these hearings the acting president of
the foundation told the members of the sub-
committee that the network atLempLs to offer
“a platform for every point oi view." In
answer to lhe question by Senator Thomas
Dodd as to Whether the Pacifica stations would
allow anyone to broadcast who had refused to

Peter M. Miller

SCARLET AND BLACK

 

testify under oath whether he had engaged in
espionage or sabotage against the United
States, the acting president stated:

“In the absence of any evidence that it
was 1 fact that he had so engaged, the
honest answer would have to be yes, 1
would allow him,"

After the Conclusion of the hearing in Jan-
uary the American Civil Liberties Union came
to the defense of the foundation and stated that
the subcommittee’s investigation was unconsti-
tutional. The ACLU pointed out that ”the pro-
gram log of any of these stations for any given
week reveals the broadcast spectrum of politi-
cal opinion is not just one point of view, but a
diversity of views. This is daily application of
the First Amendment's purpose, to expose the
public to different political, economic and So-
cial thought.”

As both n frequent listener to Pacifica's
New York station as well as n former an-
nouncer, I can, vouch for the fact that the
network does, indeed, offer “a platform
for every point of view.” The popularity
or unpopularily of III issue, speaker, topic
etc. is not a criterion in deciding the typc
of programming of Pacifica stations.

Our government is in great danger of com-
mitting an unpardonable infringement on the
fundamental right of free speech as guaranv
teed by the First Amendment of our Constitu.
lion, Whether the FCC will grant approval to
the long-pending applications for permanent
licenses for the three Pacifica stations is, as of
the present moment, very questionable, The
final decision as to whether or not the Pacifica
network should continue to exist Should lie in
the hands of its listeners. If the Stations are
unpopular the withdrawal of financial support
by the listening public will quickly bring about
their demise without any unnecessary addi-
tional pressure from the government.

Forum For Descent

l In retrospect, the Grinnell “Folk Festival”
can be considered an overwhelming sliccess.
It intended to get as many guitarrplaying 5mg-
ers before its audience as the budget allowed,
ﬁnd it fulfilled this deepest and most profound
intention. Its only fault lay in its title.

Had the festival had some other name, Grin-
nell College might have maintained a greater
degree of integrity. The weekvnd would then

have been another concert series in the per-
petual attempt to make Grinnell Students like
their weekend. But implied in the title was a
notion of education, a notion that. something
was coming to lend new iHSIghts into the Na-
'tional Character and thus the nature of man,
.This was somewhat misleading.

The festival began on a note of prurient
salacious presumption. Bonnie Dohson was
the harlot heroine, paid for seducing
her audience into thinking She represented
a spontaneous effusion of vitality, of
warmth based on emotional involvement.
The result was insipid and pretty, as gen-
uine as any third-rate imit; on of Joan
Baez. Miss Dobson shone particularly shal-
low on her one Johnny Mathis number and
was outstandingly dull.

 

Ian and Sylvia got up next. They sang
"Greenwood Sidie" with enough conviction to
keep them off “Hootenanny” for months, Ian’s
twelve-string guitar was especially reminiscent
of the great loss we all feel with the doom of
Huddie Ledbetter. Their renditions of gospel
material were also tawdry and dilute. Both
performers were very good-locking.

. Things then got much bener. Virilicy‘charac-
terized the performances of all the blues musi-
cians. both Friday night ,and SatugaLafters
noon, despite the inevitable tworway ingraiia-
tion b etween audience and performers.
Especially memorable was Dean Wood’s con~
,versation with Porkshop Saturday morning.

 

By Saturday night everybody was wait-
ing for Reverend Gary Davis, the grand
old man of country ragtime and the Se-
govia of American folk guitar. The audi-

ence was overly polite, thinking that re-
straint was more respectful than enthusi-
asm, but Rev. Gary knew what the trouble
was and demanded a record number of em
cores by constantly heading off-stage, He
meanwhile demonstrated his integrity of
feeling. his overwhelming musicianship ——
his love for his malarial. Special'lhanks
should go to John Cohen for his fine in-
troductory remarks.

The New Lost City Ramblcrs were uno
doubtedly the high point In the festival. Their
immediacy and unashamed allegiance to good-
time oldrtimey music proved that city per-
formers can sound genuine with enough dedir
cation and affection to legitimate folk/liters
ature. Their Stage humor was excellently in
keeping with that peculiar mode of rural trag-
icomedy when you don't know whether lo
laugh or cry. Mike Seeger's autoharp solo oi
“Come All You Fair and Tender Ladies”
should be enough to keep Grilmell folksingcrs
away lrom Joan Baez albums for some time.

The Ramblers' captivating, hellrbent for
leather finale, “The Orange-Blossum Special.”
had everybody forgetting sophisticated reser-
vonons about the old-time fiddle. They were a
roaring success.

Slnce the concerts committee had a strange
mania for getting as many people into Darby
as possible, the question 0! future experiments
with traditional music must always remain in
doubt. This generation, like the television ex»
cutive, seems committed to getting record
numbers inside things—telephone booths, old
automobiles, etc. But if the presence of the
Lenox group is any indication of a tolerance
for serious minority tastes, we may have big-
ger and better folk festivals in years to come.

Maryland Establishes Board
To Thaw Frosiburg Impasse

 

By Jeffrey kohlmon

The State of Maryland has
I a u n c h e d an investigation
aimed at settling a student and
faculty uproar against the
president of Frostburg State
College.

The State board was called
in after the American Associa-

tion of American Professors
complained about the dismiss-
al of four English teachers at
the four year liberal arts colr
lege. R. Brown hardesty,
president of the small state col.
lege Since 1954, allegedly fired
the four teachers for promot-
ing avanogorde poetry, dis-
cussing controversial books in
the classroom, and joining slu-
dents in the Frostburg ”beat
cafes.”

The dismissal was protest-
ed by the students when they
staged a march ended in an
effigy hanging. President
Hardesty didn’t take this
too kindly, and placed thirty
students on probation. He
also demanded letters of
apology from student lead-
ers. It was recently found
out that these letters were
later used to prevent further
demonstrations At. the be-
ginning of this month the‘
president of the student gov—
ernment stated that he had
been forced to quit by Presi»
dent Hardesty. Hardesty,
when quéstioned about this
and other related campus

 

problems, said lime except
that in his opinion there wer-
no campus tensions.

He said that faculty dissent-
ers opposing his policies in—
cluded “people whose work
has not been entirely satisfacA
Lory," gripers and disappoint-
ed 'status Seekers, While there
are no tensions, Hardesty ad-
mitted that there were prob

lems.

NQSAS Apartheid Issue

Jonty Driver is an unusually tall'l’nan, He
is also a tragic rnan. Jonty Driver is President
of the National Union of South African Stu-
dents. which is today struggling fiercely
agains the government of South Africa over
the issue of apartheid. The student members
of NUSAS are actively opposed to this repres-

sive social system, and have called for wide-
spread social Ireform.

On October 17.,four members of the govern-
ment Security Police raided the NUSAS office
in Cape Town. The officers searched through
files, read correspondence, and confiscated
eight documents For two months now, the
Ministers of the South Africa government have
carried on a campaign of slander and intimis
dation against NUSAS.

The intent of these moves is to frighten
students away from the organization and
lay the ground for an eventual banning of
NUSAS. The government has full authority
to do this, for (he Sabotage Act of 1962 em-

. powers the government to treat as a
criminal virtually any person who openly
criticizes government racial policy.

A ban on the organization would be a fairly
mild governmental action in South Africa,
Over 335 other South Africans who have op-
posed the racial policies ‘of the government
are now being held in solitary confinement in
prisons throughout the country. Some of these
people have been in solitary rooms of cells for
five and a half months, beyond the reach of
lawyers, family. or the church. The laws of
South Africa allow the government to hold for
an indefinite period of time any person sus-
pected of “communism,” which in this case
means almost any opposition to the govern
ment’s policy of apartheid. Prisoners are al-
.lwed no visitors, no legal recourse, and no

.contact with the outside world. Many lam<
lies do not even know where arrested persons

a held.

,' The policies that these people have a.»
posed are designed to effect a complete
separation between South Africa’s 3,250,000
whites and its 13,815,000 Africans, Asians.
and mixed < ancestry “colored." Some
members of the same families hag: been

 

separately classified as European and

Colored under the Race Classification sys-

tem.

It is unlawful for a white person and a non—
white person to drink a cup of tea together in
a tea room anywhere in South Africa, unless
they have obtained a special permit to do so.

If an African sits on a bench in a public park
which is set apart for the exclusixe use of
White persons, he commits a criminal offense
and is liable to a fine not exceeding three hun-
dred pounds, or to imprisonment for a period
not exceeding three years, or to a Whipping
not exceeding ten strokes, or to any combina—
tion of two of these punishments.

Over 350,000 Africans are convicted under
the “pass” laws each year. A pass is a govern
ment document carrying the bearer's name,
photograph, tax receipts and official permis-
sion for the bearer to be wherever he is. With-
out a pass an Air an cannot enter a town or
City or work for wages on a farm, He must
carry it with him always and must surrender
it immediately on demand from any police-
man or authorized member of the public. With-
out it he may at any time of the day or night
be arrested and imprisoned.

Thisris the system Jonty Driver is fight-
Ing. Jim Parkison, Dan Friedlander, and
I met Jonty this summer at [he USNSA
National Student Congress in Indiana. He
is visibly sad and when he talks about his
country, because he knows the present
conflict can only end' in violence and
misery for his countrymen and of all racer.

Many students and student governments
familiar with the situation in South Africa
have expressed their concern for the safety of
NUSAS through personal messages and resolu-
tions of various kinds. This has been done in
the hope that moral suasion and the glare of
publicity Wlll temper the actions of the South
African government. This happened once be-
fore, in the Treason Trials of 195549131. The
pressure of inter-national protest in that case
had clear effects, and the government backed
down. Hopefully this will work again to save

NUSAS. If it does not, a valuable voice for ,

freedom in the apartheid struggle will be sil-
enced. And Jonty Driver will go with it.

play was chosen was be-
cause fewer costumes would
be necessary," Mrs. Hung

said. “Chinese opera uses a
bare stage with only a few
pieces of setting which sug-

gest the scene. Such a bare

stage has to have elaborate
costumes to attract atten-
tion.

Karen Hardy is in charge of
costumes for the play. Even
articles such as high soled
boots and the emperor’s beard
are being made by Grinnell
students. The shoes are spe-
cially made to give the illue
sion of the actors’ having tiny
bound feeti

The play will be followed by a
performance of the "Dance of
the Palace Lanterns," directed
by Mrs. Betty Voertman. The
lanterns, whose patterns have

 

been designed by Richard Cer-
vene (art), were also made by
the Oriental drama class.

“The movements in the
play and dance are all
stylized," Peggy Ziegenhag-
en noted. “When we first
started rehearsing, it was
hard to get inside the char-
acter because of the formal ‘
aspect. Also, it is a difficult ,
for anyone not trained to
perform an opera to execute
the motions correctly. Chl-
nese actors are placed in a
theater school in childhood
and are trained for years.
Dexterity of movement is
one of the greatest criteria
for a good actor.”

Mrs. Hung replied, “Despitl
the stylization of movement,
the play portrays the same hu-
man emotions as any western
play. The fundamental in-
stincts and emotions are the
same everywhere." '

Members of Orchesis rehearse for the "Dance of I’M
Palace Laterns" which will follow "The Price of Wine."

'I'om Wenner Reiects Victory

Popular Tom Wenner, a re-
luctant write-in candidate for
senior class president, said
Wednesday, after being de-
, lared the overwhelming victor
. the race for senior class
president, that he must decline
0 accept the post because

there are “too many important
noncerns I have to handle.”

In a campaign conducted by
an unauthorized group of anon-

ymous "friends," the Wenner
ticket received a landslide of
support that more than doubled
the total vote count of the
closest contender.

This year's senior class pres-
ident will he Dave Evans. He
placed second in total vote
count in Wednesday‘s elections.

.Other senior rclass officers
are Bill Hicks, vice president;
Mark Ferdinand, treasurer;
and Ann Hart, secretary.

 

Government Servant Rules by Crisis

In Order to Create

By Kathy Elliott

_ "The goal of the government
Iervant is the generation and
gulrivat'ion of consensus,” said
[Charles 0. Lerche, Jr., Profes-
sor of International Relations
in the School of International
Service at The American Uni-

,versity. Lerche spoke on "The
portance of an Informed
blic in a Democratic Soci-

oty” in Herrick Chapel on Fri-

Ilay, November 15, as a part of

. e Grinnell College Student

ymposium.

“What-the government wants
from me as a citizen," Lerche
paid, “is consensus so that‘ it
Yuan workyon a day to day basis

. without conferring with me. I

m to trust the government

and allow automation autonw

my to enact the job to be

Hone.”

Lerche described the com-

osite image of the Amer-

an‘ public which the For-
eign Policy Conunittee holds
today. The initial image is
that of an uninformed. unin-
terested, irrational, highly
‘ernotional mass whose nor-
mal state is “hopeless di-
vision: The government sees
itself strung between the
mass hysteria and mass re-
laxation” of a public which
can only be dealt with on
.an “emotional scale," said
Lerche.

The government sees itself
as sufficiently dedicated and
educated to conduct public
husiness, while the masses
“need not, cannot, and should

not be taken into government
lionfidence.”

Since any government needs
the backing of its constituents,
lerche pointed out the masses
are needed to give the govern.
ment there consensus. "There-

Public Consensus

fore, it is necessary to see that
the consensus is formed the
right way by steering mass at‘
titude through consensus en-
gineering," Lerche said.

The most effective method
of obtaining “instant; consen-
sus" Is by declaring a crisis,
a time when the masses can
always be counted on to rally

*behind their leader. Thus, the
government today “conducts
more than one crisis simul-
taneously. That way, there is
always something for us to
worry about," Lerche said.

Lerche added that the press
is also doing what it can to in-
volve mass emotion by putting
out news in emotional, person~
alized terms and simplifying
and polarizing issues.

Lerche maintained that the
image of the “monster public”
does exist today, not because
themasses are ignorant, but
because they have been “whip-
lashed by crisis after crisis un-
til they don't know what to
believe.

“The government has cried
‘wolf’ too many times. Every
decision is said to be crucial.
The masses have been kept in
Such a high emotional State
that they have become desen~
sitized. They don’t know what
to believe, so they don’t be
lieve anything.

“The only way to re-establish
public consensus is by standing
foursquare with the public on
government issues. We need
more than consensus manage-
ent. It is impossible for our
country to move forward with-
out agreement and understand-
ing between the masses and
government on the nature and

content of our goals," Lerche
concluded.

SIA Executive Lectures

By Ann Showalter

Brian Eattey of the United
States information A g e n c y
launched the second part of
the Symposium, “The Execu-
tive,” speaking on “An Execu-
tive Agency in Action” Tues-
day night in Herrick Chapel.

Sprinkling his talk with an-
alogies, and anecdotes, the
Special Assistant to the Dep-
uty Director of USlA for policy
and Plans explained how the
agency uses Communications
techniques to improve US pub-
lic relations abroad.

Battey compared the USIA
to a camera lens. “The pic-
ture it gives depends upon
the scenery. You can‘t take
a picture of a snowstorm and
come out with a photograph
of a beautiful summer day;
likewise, we can’t make
films of the burning of a
church in Birmingham and
create a favorable image of
the United States with them.”

He said that when the US
tries to persuade a foreign
country to accept a specific
objective,'“lt is not our prop-

aganda that really does the
job; the people of the'coun-
try must come to believe the
innovation will b e n 2 fi t
them.”

He hypothesized that the US
might want to install a satel-
lite tracking station in a small
foreign country. There might
be opposition from “Commu-
nists," local newspapers, stu-
dent groups and others who
would say the tracking station
was a missile base in disguise.

The job of the USIA In such
a situation would he to use
films, radio broadcasts, and
magazine articles to show
that similar operations had
been beneficial in other coun-
tries and that the proposal
was in the interests of world
peace.

Battey continued, “Accept-
ance of the innovation might
start with favorable coverage
in local communications media
and» gradually the citizens
might come to think the track-
ing station would be good for
meir country." Thus, the USIA
works indirectly.

One of the propagandist’s

problems is understanding cul-
tural Values outside his own
society. For instance, during
the Korean war leaflets show-
ing an octopus Inscribed with
a hammer and sickle entan-
gling Korea in its tentacles
were dropped on North Korea.
One North Korean prisoner
said he had seen one of the
leaflets and interpreted the
cartoon to mean Communism
would guarantee the Koreans
plenty of octopus to eat.

In concluding his lecture,
Battey stated he finds his work
interesting because it deals
with the intangible: the thought
in another man’s mind.

Manly (ites Increasing Danger
in finchainetl Executive Power

By Nord Brue

In his speech Wednesday ln
Herrick Chapel, Chesly Manly
or the Chicago Tribune at-
tacked the trend toward “unfet-
tered executive supremacy and
authoritarian statism” in our
American form of government.

Manly began with an indict»
ment of President John F, Ken-
nedy for his proposed efforts to
make himself the sole instrur
ment in setting American for-
eign policy, He added that Otto
F. .Otepka was dismissed from
his state Department position
because he had testified truth-
fully to a Congressional com-
mittee about the laxity in se-
curity in the U.S. Department
of State.

He maintained that these
Incidents were not important
in themselves but that they
were symptomatic of the
trend toward increased exec-
utive power. Manly wryly ob-
served that Washington is
becoming the “Grimm World
of the Brothers Wonderful.”

Manly contended that the ex-
treme liberal and the tradi»
tional conservative are seeking
the same end and differ only in

their means to this end.

He said, “Whereas tradi-
tional conservatives favor an
aristocracy of wealth and
family, the modern liberals
put their trust in an elite of
great brains and master
planners.” “The liberals,” he
said, “intend to secure their
end by feigning a love for the
common man, while the tra-
ditional conservatives disdain
Sommoners."

To prove that the extra
power which has been given to
the executive branch since the
election of F.D.R. has been
misused, Manly referred to the
Yalta and Tehran conferences.
This policy of appeasement
was carried into the Truman
era as witnessed by the fact
that the US would not help the
Chinese Nationalists and al-
lowed that country to be taken
by the Communist forces.

Manly held the Eisenhower
administration responsible for
the {all of Cuba to the Commu»
nists and he maintained that
Kennedy’s failure to .give air
support to the Bay of Pigs in-
vasion caused that expedition
to fail. And in the Cuban Cri-
sis of 1962 the President was a
momentary hero, but he paid
a high price.

Mnnly did not hold the
Presidents personally respon-
sible but indicated that they
were the ideological captives
of their advisers. A case in
point was censorship of the
military and an anti anti-
communist policy adopted in
the summer of 1961.

The conclusion Manly drew

 

was that the powers of the pres-
ident should be restricted. This
is not to relegate him to the po-
sition of a mere figurehead for
he has many legal responsi-
bilities, In essence, he should
lead but not command.

In 1955 he rated Grinnell as
one of the top ten liberal arts
colleges in the U.S.

Information Paradox Complicales
Government Formation of Policy

By Kathy Elliott

“There is a basic parodox
between the public’s right and
need to know and the govern—
ment’s necessity for privacy,"
said James Garfield last
Thursday at 8:00 p.m. in Her-
rick Chapel, Greenfield, Dep-
uty Assistant Secretary of
State for News in the Bureau
of Public Affairs, was a guest
speaker for the Grinnell Col-
lege Student Symposium on
“The Democratic Process in
an Era of Crisis.”

“Today there is not enough
public knowledge,” said Green-
field. “An ill-informed public
does not serve the government
No policy is worth one cent un-
less it has the support of pub-
lic opinion, and the public
must have access to material
to make intelligent decisions.
Basic policies must be fully
and openly :scussed and pub-
lic enunciation made.

“However, all official busi-
ness can‘t he conducted on
Main Street at hlgh noon. 0f-
ficials must keep in mind
that what is disclosed to the
public will also be disclosed
to our enemies along with
our allies and the committed
and uncommitted nations,"
said Greenfield.

“A false leak at the wrong
time can ruin a delicate negoti-
ation. If the public were edu-
cated and interested in politics,
and If the world society
believed in open discussions,
there would be‘no fear of dan-
gerous disclosure."

_ In answer to recent accusa-
tions that the State Depart-
ment has been keeping cru-
cial information from the
public, Greenfield pointed out
that 300 neWsmen are as-
signed to cover the State De-
partment and that the de-
partment spends a third of its
time explain policies to the
public.

Greenfield specifically re-
ferred to the Cuban Crisis when
the state Department had
eleven people working around
the clock to answer 400 phone
calls daily and supply informa-
tion. “The fact that the ‘Read-
er’s Digest’ was able to write
a book from the information re»
ceived from the State Depart-
ment just one month after the
crisis hardly qualifies us for
charges of secrecy,” said
Greenfield.

 

Speaking on the lnterwork-
ings of the government and the
press, Greenfield defined the
press as the “principal ma-
chinery of communication and
dialogue between the govern-
ment and the public,"

Greenfield pointed out that
"there are moments when the
serving interest of the governa
ment and the informing inter-
est of the press don’t coincide.
The government is responsible
to the public as a whole and
not to any strong segment of
the public such as the press."

The major problem of the
press today is that it still prac-
tices the same approaches to
reporting government news as
it did when our country was en-
gaged in only one crisis at a
time, Greenfield said. “Today
we are engaged in 15 to 20
crises at a time. The amount of
information printed on govern-
ment affairs is small compared
to the material given out. Each
day’s fragments remain frag»
ments, while crisis becomes
more and more complicated."

The press is far from con-
tent with this dilemma, and
the process of “soul-search-
ing” Is beginning In journal-
ism, said Greenfield.

“With the soul~searching of
the press and the awareness‘of
government to the public’s
right to know," concluded
Greenfield, "I am confident we
will prove that democracy can
work and will prevail."

defending champion Ripon.

The Pioneers have seven let<

Mifflin and John Sundell. Miff-

Sundell, 6-8 and the Pioneer

serve roles. Rounding out the
squad are junior Barry Ander-
son and sophomores Gordon
Kin k e a d, Ted Risser, Jeff
Frantz, Bill Landsberg, Tom
Lane, Al Peterson and Phil
Coons.

A c c or din g to basketball
coach John Pfitsch, the key
1055 from last year's squad was
“in O s i; valuable basketball
player” Gar Smith, also win-
ner of the Dave Theophilus
Trophy, given to the outstand-
ing senior athlete. “We have
players who have Smith's phys-
ical ability and more, but Gar’s
main asset was not physical.

He was the most poised athlete
I’ve ever seen at Grinnell.”

Pfitsch stated that the oth-
er two seniors on last year‘s
team, Kent Rogerson and
Denny Asby, did not have
especially good years and
thus their contribution to last
year’s team would not be as
hard to replace as Smith’s.

Pfitsch emphasized that the
lack of depth at center and the
uncertainty of a replacement
for Gar Smith were his main
problems and felt that if he and
his team could adequately
solve them, they would be con-
tenders for the conference
championship.

Although another 1M football season has ended the in-
convenience and pain from some of the injuries suffered during
it are still being felt. Realizing that some of these injuries are
to be expected due to the nature of the game, one is still led to
wonder why the number remains high or increases every year.
Inquiry into this problem leads directly to a second question:
ls there something that can be done about it?

Escaping the problem by dropping 1M football, as was done
in the 205 is certainly no answer. Banning the program's
most popular sport would probably be committing 1n-
tramural suicide. Extra padding or compulsory practices forc-
ing players to get into shape are also unleasable when one ob-
jectively looks at the IM football jock.

Therefore we must examine each area of injuries, and
by attacking them separately, find some place in which im-
provement is possible. The first step in this direction oc-
curred several years ago when castoff varsity helments
were given to the 1M program. According to John c. Tmes-
dale (men’s physical education), head injuries became so
frequent that the sport was in danger of being eliminated if
something was not done.

While helmets reduced the number of head and facial in.
juries significantly, the rate at which they continued to occur
is alarming in relation to all other afflictions Every fall about
35 athletes are hurt participating in IM football seriously enough
to report to the nurse and see a doctor. These generally cost
the insurance company in the neighborhood of 51000, the total
for the 1962 8935011 being 3960144, (The size of the total is the
result of the one or two serious shoulder and/or knee disloca.
tions every year, costing several hundred dollars apiece). Of
these, one third are localized above the neck and the number
of nose bleeds and split lips not reported that would skyrocket
this total is anybody s guess For these ailments. just under $100
is payed out in insurance money The Ramsey Inurance Agency
parted with $89 for ten facial injuries last season and $96 for
the same number the year before.

The solution to this is really not so difficult, since a simple
plastic-bar face guard would eliminate probably so per cent or
the facial injuries. When someone falls down, the bar would hit
the ground, not the nose or mouth. It would also ward off the oc-

 

casional flying fist or elbow.

(NEXT WEEK: Cost and availability of face guards,
and comments of interested persons.)

of the youngest man ever

Connally and his wife had

The First Lady cradled

Senate Votes to Limit
Student Car Possession

By Wade Stevenson

After a heated debate Wed~
nesday, the Senate passed on
an amendment to the proposed
‘nr rule by Al Gummerson.
The amendment limited the po-
lession of cars to seniors,

Gummerson stated that ”it is
necessary to use the rule sys-
tem to maintain an egalitarian
atmosphere at Grinnell.” He

lso mentioned that ”the at-

ractiveness of the Grinnell
ommunity is its unrealistic at-
osphere." Gummerson pic<
red Grinnell as a unique com-
unity which . might be de-
ﬁlroyed it more cars were in-
troduced. '

Jack Chapman, SGA Pres-
ident, took exception to Gum-

merson’s remarks. wishing
to destroy the myth that
Grinnell is a unlque close-
knit community, Chapman
stated that “at times people
must get away from the col-
legal"

The amendment passed by a
margin of one vote and the
Senate, in order to determine
studeilt opinion on the entire
car rule, postponed the debate

on the rule in its entirety until
the next regular senate meet—
ing.

George Forrest, C‘ of HP
representative, announced that
those men interested in serving
on the Men's primary Court
would be interviewed this Sun-
day. Forrest indicated that the
hopefuls should prepare a let-
ter informing the c ol HP of
their views on student law.

Jack Chapman announced
that two appointments to the
High Court would be made in
the near future. Interested stu-
dents should submit their appli-
cations to Dianne Dunn, SGA
secretary, by 4 pm. November

The senate approved the ap-

They believed the fatal
shots were fired by a white
man. about 30, slender of
build, weighing about 165
pounds, and standing 5 feet
10 inches tall.

The murder weapon was
reportedly a 30-30 rifle.

Shortly before Kennedy‘s
death became known, he
was administered the last
rites of the Roman CathO‘
lic Church. He had been the
first Roman Catholic presi-
dent in American history.

Even as two clergymen
hovered over the fallen Pres-
ident in the hospital emer-
gency room, doctors and
nurses administered blood
transfusions.

Kennedy died of a gunshot
wound in the brain at ap-
proximately 1 pm. (CST) ac-
cording to an announcement
by acting White House press
secretary Malcolm Kilduif.

don Johnson, and his wile

later. Newsmen had no op-
portunity to question them.
, It was the first death of a
president in office since
Franklin D. Roosevelt died

. of a cerebral hemorrhage at
Worm Springs, 6a., in April
1945.

and despair after her hus«

collapse or give way to hys-
Ieria.

When he entered the hos-

pital, her clothing was cov-
ered with blood from her
husband’s wounds.

Lt. Erich Kaminskl of the
Secret Service said the assas-
sin’s weapon appeared to
have been a “highpowered
Army or Japanese rifle of
about .25 caliber.” The rifio
had a scope on it, he said.

The entire building where
the sniper was located was
evacuated. People were
working in the building at the
time of the shooting.

Dallas inspector .l. n,
Sawyer Said, “Police found
the remains of fried chicken
and paper on the fifth floor.
Apparently the persons had

After the fatal shots were
fired at Kennedy, the strick-

the scene at top speed _.

pital and trying to get the
presidential party out of
