Faculty Committee Answers SGA
‘WitIi Statement on Due Process

By Bob Hadlema
and John Wolf

The Faculty Committee on Stu-
dent Affairs late this week issued
a founandoneshalf page state
ment of their feelings toward jur-
isdictional lines and due process
at Grinnell.

The statement, an answer to
last week's demands for clarifi-
cation on these points by son
and the student courts, began by
stating. “ The Committee on Stu-
dent Affairs regrets the tone of
the letters submitted to it by
members of the SGA.”

The FCSA members warned,
“The Committee wishes to remind
those students that no useful end
can be served by calling its good
will gratituitously into question.
In the long run, a strategy of im-
tagonism can only defeat or new
ﬂat valueless what ever purpose
it seeks.”

The FCSA asserted that the stu—
dent courts “may be taken to rep-
resent the ‘Student interest'," and
that those interests are “not iden-
tical with the community interest
in the sense of ‘the interest of the
College as a whole and as an on
going institution’."

The FCSA concluded that “Stu-
dent Courts may not be the proper
agency for handling cases in
which the community interest
most crucially at stake is that of
the College as a whole rather
than that of the student body
only."

On matters of jurisdiction, the
FCSA expressed its intention of
hearing cases where tile commu-
nity interest is involved or where
a hearing by the student courts
might endanger a student’s well-

Republicans Hear
Javils Via Phone

Sen. Jacob K, JaVits (Rep. N.Y.)
will speak to Grinnell students via
telephone at 9 pm. Monday.

His talk, “The Republican Party
—A Time of Change,” will origin-
ate in Washington, D.C., and will
be heard in the South Lounge of
the Forum. A question and answer
period Will follow the talk.

Now serving his second term in
the Senate. Javits has never lost
an election. He served in the House
of Representatives from 1946 to
1954, and was elected to the San-
ate in 1956.

Senator Javits’ telephone talk is
one of a series being sponsored by
the Young Republicans Club.

who was scheduled to speak via
telephone last Tuesday, was
forced to cancel his talk due to
illness. Dirksen expressed hope

being. The FCSA did agree that
an SGA official should be con-
suited to determine which cases
would be heard by which judicial
body.

The report recommended that
cases of possible conduct proba-
tion be handled by the courts or
by the Deans' Committee. (The
Deans’ Committee »— comprising
the dean of men, dean of women,
and associate dean of the college
— was established early this year
by the Acting President to assure
a unified approach to the problems
handled by each dean.)

Concerning due process, the re-
port Stated, "it is felt the Commit-
tee should ossure the accused
those protections traditionally as-
sociated with fair hearings, rec-
ognizing that the student’s rights
and liabilities under college regu-
lations are not fully analogous to
the citizen’s rights and liabilities
under public law."

The report recommended that
the accused student be given writ<
ten notification of the charges
against him and that he have the
right to be present when evidence
is presented against him. In par-
entheses, the report noted, ” ‘Evl-
dence’ here refers to information
on the nature of the alleged vio-
lation actually introduced before
the judicial body and not to such
information as may have led to

notice or investigation of a viola< '

tion.”

Finally, the chn agreed to stu-
dent demands that in cases of
misconduct, the three deans will
not sit in judgement of the case.
They noted, however, that this
provision could be overturned by
a ruling of the faculty.

 

Acting President James H.
Stauss reminded students this
week that the FCSA report in-
cluded only recommendations and
was subject to his approval,

Stauss also said that these pro-
posals will be discussed with SGA
officials.

these cases.

“Due process” is an honored rubric of law, especially
constitutional law, standing for the individual‘s right to “fair ’
governmental proceedings, It is a matter of “fair” procedure
on behalf of the individual in his transactions with the gov-
ernmental agency or official. It is a concept which has difs

theme is always the rights of the individual.

Panel Discussion on Scholarship
Fails To Develop Issues Clearly

By Bob Hodierne

A panel discussion before a
floor-lull of Grinnell students in
the South Lounge of the Forum
last night was a masterpiece of
misunderstanding.

The panel was composed of a
promising lot. Reginald Archam-
bault (education) was moderator.
Sheldon Zitner (English) was
there, Al Jones (history) was
there. Mike Young (Friar) was
there. And Pete Read (Coil-IF)
was there.

The only thing that wasn't
there was a discussion worthy of
such a distinguished gathering.

Read started the discussion after
a short reading by Archambault.
Read argued that the “reason for

college is to produce people, not
scholars."

Read stressed that scholastl~
Cism should have a practical pur-
pose and should not be an end in
itself.

Young countered by saying in a
reasonably direct manner that
scholary habits “must be pursued
for their own sake to be success-
ful,"

Jones, who claims to have
trouble talking with Edgar Mul-
lins (mathematics), said that per-
haps the only “integrating force"
in college education today is fuot<
ball,

And then, strangely, the topic
became a faint memory.

Instead of a dlscussion on
whether or not a student should
be a scholar for the sheer satis»
faction of being a scholar, the dis-
cussmn disintegrated, as Archam-
bault pointed out, into more of a

discussion of how best to produce
a scholar.

Read’s rather provocative topic
was, to use football jargon, which
should please Jones, completely
lost in an “end nln.” The topic
was lost in spite of a valiant effort
by Archambault to keep the panel
on the right track.

The best suggestion of the eve-
ning was proffered by Zitner. He
suggested the discussion be
dropped at halftime. It wasn't.

The next best suggestion of the
evening was Ai‘chambault’s. He
suggested at the outset that Zit<
ner offer a rendition of “Winter
Wonderland.” Zitner didn't,

Other than those two sugges.
tiorls, nothing came out of last
night's discussion that Couldn’t
have come out of a dull faculty
committee meeting on curriculum.

 

what comes within governmental
authority? Adjudication: involv.
ing due process, or its meaning in
different situations, usually come
to some kind of pragmatic adjust-
ment of individual right and free-
dom to governmental authority.
Anyone who studies the volumi.

on due process will see repeatedly
the fact of this pragmatic adjust.
merit, “These standards of justice
are not authoritatively formulated
anywhere as though they were pro.
scriptions in a pharmacopoeia."
(332 U. s. 68.)

An important area of due pro«
cess, in which the individual hill
an equipment of rights, is "ade-
quate notice" and "fair hearing,"
1 emphasize this area, because it
is the topic of current campus dis-
cussion and because I believe that
individual claims to have adequate
notice and fair hearing should be
respected and protected in col-
lege governmental operations.
Among other essentials, “the right
to a hearing embraces not only
the right to present evidence but
also a reasonable opportunity to
know the claims of the opposing
party and to meet them,” (304 U.S.
18.)

In constitutional cases involving
standards of fair hearing. courts
are frequently troubled by maneu<
vers and problems attending the
ability and effort of one party to
prevent or suppress evidence use-
ful to the other party. in courts of
law, the individual has many liabil-
ities (or restrictions of freedom),
such as subpoena, oath, and con<
tempt liability, as well as certain
safeguards, relevant to this prob-
lem of prevention or suppression of
evidence. These liabilities are not
typical of hearings on the college
campus. Yet, the same problem of
doing justice to each side recurs
in the circumstances of some cases
on the campus.

Accordingly, the problem centerl
in the conditions and extent of the
accused’s Claim to know the
sources of evidence against him.
In View of two beliefs, I am not
congenial to any absolute pres-
cription. My first belief is, that
various pressures on the individual
may lead to unfair suppression o!
evidence in ways that in fact sup.
press responsible individual actiol
and are detrimental to the col-
lege. My second belief is, that w.
must avoid a system of secret [to
formants. I think it possible to
have a “fair” adjustment of these
considerations within the scopﬂ
D! a “fair" hearing.

The FCSA

We don’t quite understand why the faculty, through the
Faculty Committee on Student Affairs, has taken upon itself
to administer law and order on the Grinnell campus.

What troubles us most is that, unlike administration of-
ficials, we can’t even talk to the FCSA. To be sure, we did
receive a vague written statement on the committee‘s duties
that appeared in the first issue of the 5&3 after Christmas,
but we have never been granted an interview.

To heighten our irritation, in its most recent statement
the FCSA observed that its lninutes show that the committee
had indeed made a recommendation on the problem of ju 's-
diction at a January meeting and that the problem was dis-
cussed at other meetings Then the report blasts the students:
“Student ignorance of this fact does not excuse the charges
that have been made against the committee.”

Still, the FCSA has consistently refused to discuss
the business of its meetings with the 5&3.

Our records show that three of the eight FCSA members
do not subscribe to the 8&8, which does at least give an indi-
cation of present campus attitudes. Are not the non-subscrib-
ers failing to inform themselves of Student Affairs, even
though such information is easily available?

Finally, we just cannot see why any faculty member
would want to get involved in an undertaking that adds so
greatly to a schedule that apparently has most professors
teaching too many classes.

So let’s give up on the FCSA and give back to the admin-
istration that which the administration says it possesses—
the right to judge student conduct. The actions of the admin-
istration, at least, are understandable, even if not agreed with,

it came to pass, in a land in;
the cold and bleak regions of
Scandinavia, that there lived a
race of exceeding tall and fair
people, noted ror their good-l
nature and slow wit,

And it also came to pass
that there lived among these
people an exceeding short and
dark youth noted for his foul-
nature and quick wit. '

nature was far from pleasing,
the King, tall and slow-witted,
Was able to perceive some
worth in having such a person
as counsel, And so the King
made the little man Chief

for one so young.

And, it being a time of war,

ly happens in government, the
Chief Counsel was the person
best able to negotiate the
treaty, for not only was he the
fastest Wit in the natlon, but the
tar southern land was a land
of his own people.

The Emperor of the southern
land, a mighty potentate, was
surprised when he saw the
counsel sent to him by his
friends of the North. He was
surprised by the Counsel’s
youth. He was surprised by
the Counsel’s stature. And,
most of all, he was surprised
by the Counsel’s complexion.

The Emperor was surprised,
but impressed and much in-
clined to be amenable to the

quick wit also, could not resist
a little humor in a business so
serious. Said he, “Does your
King send to me, a mighty po~
ientate, a beardless youth to ne-
gotiate so complex and valued
a treaty?”

And the youthful Counsel,
being of foul-nature, said, “Had
my King known that you im-
puted wisdom to a heard, he
most certainly would have sent
a goat."

Now one can only go so
with an emperor, a mighty
tentate, and it seemed that
Counsel had gone too far,
forthwith the Emperor had
youth’s head removed.

A Parable 0/ Just Deserts '

One day, under a glaring sun, in the middle of
a scorched desert, a young scientist, an elderly
philosopher, and a camel driver chanced to meet.
“Where are you going?” asked the camel driver.

“Why, my good man," replied the philosopher,
“that isn’t a relevant question atall. It matters
little where I am going as i haven’t gotten there
yet. Rather, you should inquire as to where l have
been in order to discover the relationship between
my previous situation and my present, more tan-
glble (even it just as much transient) locus. In this
way, through an orderly investigation or all relaled
properties you would be able to understand the sig-
nlncancc of my being independent or any tempor-
ary goal.”

“I am researching,” said the young scientist. "i
am not going anywhere, Being here is important in
itself. Who knows what I may discover,” he said
and began sitting the sand with a sieve,

“ineVltably,” replied’the philosopher to the sci-
entist, “you will discover the limits of your knowl-
edge. It is necessary to divorce oneself from lhe
immediate in order to gain a complete vision. one
cannot know; one can only speculate. The essence

lol the problem is to remain apart and malntclln

one’s objectivity. in the course of events one Will
undoubtedly ﬁnd that once solid connectlons become
tenuous and that things once considered periecl lice
come flawed. in any case, one must remain flex-
able.” «

"The more you know," replied the scientist, “the

more accumie your entire picture becomes."

“And indeed, more difﬁcult to assemble," nn-
swered the philosopher. "That is why i am here.
Someone must discover lhe relationship of the parts
to the whole, But it must be done without involve
ment with any one of the parts. Such an involve-
menr would tend [0 result in a biased universal, an
immersion of the whole in the single pail. it one
truly seeks veritas, one must seek it in comparative
darkness."

“I say," Said the sclenllst. who had not been
listening, “this is ouicksandl Help me get out!"

“Darkness,” repeated the philosopher. “Darkness
is unfortunately lhe suit! true conceptions are made

need one ray at a time, or else we become lost in
the chaos oi many. We can accept only so much
mVla at any given moment. else we become
drowned in it.”

“I say, help!” screamed lhe young scientist,

“Drowned, yes I said drowned,” continued the
philospher smiling beatiﬁcially. “In the scheme of
the universe, the surprising is commonplace and in-
iinity is the yardstick. We can only hope to grab
some solid object, to reach some high ground in
order to maintain, it only for a moment, a stale
oi stability in a situation in which the norm is
ilux. In this way, and only in this way, may we
gain an understanding or the true order of nature."

“Help," screamed the Scientist, trying to grab
the philosophers leg. The camel driver, who ﬁnally
was awakened by the scientist's anguished cry
leaped to the ground and hurried over to him. To~
gather with the philosopher, whom he aroused
irom his reverie. he helped the scientist out or (he

“We may indeed iii-ill that there is nothing solid
outside at ourselves,” said the philosopher as the
scienllst was Wiping the muck from his clothing.
“in which case we must turn in upon our own be-
ing for the stability necessary to ‘draw order 1mm

”My goodness," said the scientist, picking up his
sieve again, “I shall have to do my research some
where else . , . perhaps that dune over there.”

“You will iiiid nothing but quicksarld my good
man," replied lhe philosopher. “One can which
stand the essence of that hill from here much bet-
ter than when one is immersed in it. The meme

whipping his animal into motion. As he picked his
way around the quicksand that the solentlst had

l'wo foreign Students View America

I [all Sees

0n the eve of my departure
to America, a friend duly
warned me that here was found

the truest image or two modern
ngS: Machine and Mammon.
Indeed, when I first saw hun-
dreds of beautiful cars parked
outside Miami Airport, 1 won-
dered, not knowing to whom
they belonged, why on earth
should an automobile factory
be built at that inconvenient
spot. And as I later counted
amazedly the number of splen-
‘did bathrooms in American
low-ceilinged, cracker box<
shaped houses. it dawned upon
me chat perhaps their etiluence
was also showing the influence
of their affluence.

But after four years of lib-
eral arts, especially psychol-
ogy, these earlier impressions
gave way to I different View of
the American scene. What is
really fascinating is not the
wealth shimmering from coast
to coast, The American, is new
chap, is himself the marvel. He
is pro-eminently pragmatic.
The proof of the pudding is in
the eating — this philosophy
haunts his mind constantly
like a nursery rhyme. A cole

ing rat cages or a businessman

Pragmatism, Paradox

reasons as well as for lowering
his income-tax bracket is prag-
matism in action. But in this
neterogeneous society with con-
flicting‘values, the American

is also a bundle of curious
paradoxes. For example, he
may simultaneously be chival-
ric to the fair sex, yet not very
bashful in accepting the offer
to split expenses with his date;
so fond of his dog, yet so ad-
verse to his mother-in-law;
generous in donating to worthy
causes such as the Aid Com-
mittee for Unmarried Mothers,
yet so pennyrconscious even
with his married daughter.
Yet, the American system
is inspired by lofty abstractions
— this in the most practical of
people — and the gap between
the ideal and the real leads to
confusion and anxiety, For the
American is is Don Quixote; he
set out on a journey with in
vincible good will for mankind
but mistakes inns for castles,
windmills ior giants. He looks
up to the stars of freedom and
too late realizes that his feet
have slipped into the quick-
sands of Selma and Harlem.
Occasionally, overbelief
in pragmatism has restrained
his artistic expression to auto-
mobiles and cosmetics. Sympv

 

tomsrof a boredom neurosis
are manifest behind his mar-
ketplace antl~lntellectunl cmw-
ing. He can hardly sit still: the
telephone, the appointment
book, constantly drag him
here and there and life be-
comes one damn thing after an-
other. He can only rest on the
psychoanalyst’s c o u ch, but
there dies of heart attack.

Out of this potpourri of trails

lacking in manners but having

in this Iowan hamlet, I enjoy
fully ~— as do Tocquevillc once
said — meeting this chap, ”my
spiritual passage to more than

wenches are born. It has to be

Felix lungu

lungu Distressed By

While still in Africa, the few
he met told him so much about
the glories of their America.
That is how he began dreaming
about the day when ha would
leave for America. His anxiety
to see America grew like a
crystal, until it came to a point
whereby America became his
drenmland.

Then the day came when he
had to bid farewell to his rela<
tions and friends at an African
airport. His plane takes off, he
is now on his way to his dream.
land.

But, within fifty miles or so
off the coast of America, the jet
pilot gives a warning, “Fasten
your seat belts ladies and

entlemen; we are approaching
stormy weather." The excited
black dreamer fastens his seat
belt too since he considers him-
self one of the gentlemen; or
at least at home he was! In
America he may at times just
be one of the “ain’t you ‘boys’
look alike!” Anyway his jet
buzzes into the new John F.
Kennedy airport. It has finally
brought him to his dreamland.

Now he is breathing Ameri-
can air. He gets off of the plane
and is led to the immigration
officer who checks his passport,
X-ray photographs, and some
other trivials which the dream-
er considers unnecessary. He
says “Hulloh!” to the immigra-
tion officer. The officer replies

 

by saying “Hi." The dreamer
is really confounded, no kidding
at all; he says to himself,
“What is ‘Hi'? At home we say
‘Hulloh’ to another 'Hulloh', but
here ‘Hulloh' then ‘Hi'; so this
is American talk! Anyway I’ll
find out." He is taken to a hotel
in New York City where he
will probably dream his first
American dreams.

Ha spend two days in New
York City arranging to leave
for his final destination. What
he perceives in these two days
leaves definite marks on his
mind. Now, at least, he has be-
gun to know America not only
by listening to an American
mouth, but also by llVlng in
Amerlca. He realizes that after
all his dreams in Africa about
American life were not all true,
some were undoubtedly illus-
ory.

He spends a year in America,
only to be attacked by a deadly
disease. This is the disease he
will ever suffer from as long as
there is no real fundamental
change in America. He realizes
that after all ‘some people think
that he is just another black
boy which is of course true,
good only for quite a bad num—
ber of vices. He is always con-
sclous of his Negroness. This
consciousness is his greatest
bother. He is never allowed to
forget it. After talking to many

 

Brutality

other black African students,
he learns that they are just as
confounded as he is. They even
tell him, “If you want to know
America real well go to Birm-
ingham; there you are going
to faint.” However, the foreign
student, especially the black
one, is not naive about Ameri-
can heterogeneity and so he
comforts himself with the
thought that at least not all
America is Americanism, al-
though the bulk Of it is.

I say these things so that the
Grinnell liberal arts students
may know what sort of life
some of its population learn to
live, especially outside the
small Grillnell Atlantis. And far
more important, so far as I am
concerned, that they may un-
derstand the so-called Anti-
Amerlcan attitude that seems
to be prevalent in free Africa
today. The reasons for this atti-
tude are not complicated at

no means facists. If they are,
it’s just that they have learned

Not Physically Pfit Says Plitscli,
PfIabb y, Pfat Seniors May Pflunlr

ny Jim i-ierzog

Approximately 100 of 132 senior
men have so far tailed to complete
the physical education objectives
required for graduation.

According to John Ptltsch (phy-
llcal education), only five or six
Out of the 100 are "in jeopardy of
not graduating."

Pfitsch said that the vast ma«
jority of the men have completed

art of the physical education oh-

ctives which qualify for two aca-
demic credits and are needed for
graduation.

The present senior class at Grin-
lies is the first to graduate under
Ihe revised physical education re-
quiremean instituted in the fall
If 1561.

To pass physical education, sen-
lors must (1) pass the college
lwimmmg test, (2) demonstrate
Iliill in two individual carryover
sports, (3) pass a physical fitness
lest, and (4) participate in team
Iports.

“The situation isn‘t really as
bad as it looks,” Piitsch said. He
has checked each student's prog-
less, and said that all are within
ﬂange.

 

"There isn’t anybody who does-
n‘t feel he can complete the re-
quirements,” he said.

Looking at the indivtdual re-
quirements within the program,
Pfitsch said that there are only
two seniors who have had to re-
sort to classes this semester to
complete their team sport require-
ment. Normally, the team sport
requirement is satisfied by par-
ticipation in at least four intra-
mural sports.

Piitsch said some men have not
yet passed the swimming test, but
only three or four oan’t swim. The
others are people who haven’t
taken the test yet. He said there
isn’t anyone Who will find it im»
possible to complete the swimming
requirement.

According to Plitsch, five or six
men have not completed the physi-
cal fitness portion of the test.

Most of the 100 men who have
not completed their physical edu-
cation requirement iack either a
major or a minor carryover
sport, said Plitsch. He added, “The
great majority or these have done
work in one or both carry-over
sports. Looking fairly closely at
the situation, I think it's going to
be okay."

 

Pfitsch said he was most con-
cerned about the four to six men
“who've chosen to procrastinate."
In their cases, few of the physical
education requirements have been
completed and their graduation is
doubtful.

As to the program itself, Pfitsch
feels that it has been successful.
He Sald, “I think the people I
have worked with have gotten
more from this program than the
aid program." The old program
applied to the class of 1964.

The worst offenders in failing to
complete the requirements, said
Pfitsch, are the varsity athletes.

Offered for men as majors are
the following sports: tennis, golf,
acquatics, small Craft, bowling,
and karate. For minors the same
sports are offered, and in addi-
tion, bndmiton, paddle tennis,
fencing, riding, skiing, ice skating,
and unicycling can be taken for
credit.

(CPS) More than 150 students
from the City University of New
York have volunteered this semes-
ter to tutor chlldren in remedial
subjects at schools, churches and
community centers in Harlem.

Studenls' Rights Essentially lust.
Asserls ‘Firm Believer' in letter

To the Editor:

I write this letter because I
have a firm belief in the im-
portance of the maintenance of
the civil liberties of any mem-
ber of any society. In spite of
the fact. that a college commun-
ity is a unique kind of society,
possibly even because of this
fact, I feel that the liberties
which are guaranteed by the
Sixth Amendment of the United
State OOHSLituLlOn, and the Uni-
versal Declaration of the Rights
of Man. should apply to Grin-
nell College.

The right of the accused to
confront his accusers has been
a basic right of Americans vir-
tually since we became a na-
tion. Despite the fact that this
has not been the custom in all
academic institutions, the es-
sential justness of this position
seems to me to be confirmed.

It may be argued that such a
right in a college society would
be impractical. It would be. if
the goal of the college were
"practicality”; however, just
as in the society beyond the col-
lege community, the loss of
an amount of that which is
i‘practical" is the price which
we must pay for our freedom.
Why should we not be willing
to pay this price in a college
community as well? Is freedom
not to be as valued here as in
the Outside world? Should not
those rights which we regard
as basic in the outside world be
basic to all phases of life, in-
cluding that of the college com-
munity as well? My argument
is not that we should adopt this
liberatarian position because it
is practiced in the outer com-
munity, or because it will edu-

About Peace Corps

“A venture in mutual under-

Weeks Calls his two year Peace
Corps teaching assignment in
the jungles of North Borneo.
Weeks, a 24 year-old graduate
of Southern Methodist Univer-
sity, will be on me Grinnell
campus Thursday and Friday,
March 18 and 19, to speak about
his experiences.

Weeks, knowri to the Villagers
as “Sigar”—the leaderiworhed
in the rice patties to learn the
dialect, taught English, history,
and geography, organized a
Boy Scout troop, gave first aid
demonstrations, taught sewing,
and gave swimming instruc-
tions.

The village in which Weeks
lived fit the Peace Corps
“image”—it had no running
water and no electricity. As a
matter of fact, most at the vii-
lagers had never even heard of
America.

Weeks' involvement with the
young people of his community
did not end when he returned
to the United States. Using his
own money, Weeks returned to
Borneo to set up an education
fund for students to continue
their schooling.

The Memory Compus'Sti/I Exists
0 Canvas In The Physical Plant

By Kris Nash

For those who are intrigued by
what might have been. there is a
fascinating canvas hanging In one
ofﬁce of the physical plant. it is
the Grinnell “Campus of the Fu-
ture," an artist's representation
or a layout which was the result
of “a decade of car to] study by
appropriate committees, in coop-
oration with engineers, architects,
and landscape experts," It was
finalized in 1949 and published in
the November issue of ahe Alumni
S&B, while Samuel N. Stevens was
the acting president or the college.

The A5“! explained that the
dream plan “in no way destroys

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the ‘memory’ campus but pre-
serves the spirit, the atmosphere,
the compactness, and the land-
marks, and beautifies, enhances,
and meets the modern needs of
present-day Grinnell.” It was in-
tended to accommodate 1,000 resi-
dent students and 100 off-campus
dwellers.

The portrayal of the campus has
the appearance of an aerial view,
but lacks the accuracy in certain
relative distances and topographle
cal features.

North campus was shown intact
as it exists today, with the excep-
tion of the Norris halls. South
campus, too, was identical with
the present, but for a wide porch
on the south wall 01 Mears and
the addition of a tower at the en-
trance of Loose, connected with
a large structure intended to he

rambling building rather than its

the air of central campus

To the east of the fountain, in
the location which it now occupies,
lay the Bee buildings, but with
the significant addition of a build-
ing for applied arts along the pew
er plant's west wall, The physical
plant’s towering Smokestack was
conspicious by its absence.

Needless to say, the Grinnell
Forum was missing, and the old
union was not planned, either,
Taking their place was the Stu-
dent Center and Inn, an extensive
structure at the junction of High-
way 6 and Park Street, where the
Fine Arts Center is now, The Stue

dent Center and Inn included a
Wing tor offices, class rooms, and
work shops for the Congregation-
al-Christian Conference of lowai
The remainder of the Park
Street lineup — ARI-l, Herrick
Chapel, Carnegie and Steiner
Halls -— was present, but not pic-
tured was Goodnow, East of the
Student Center and Inn, along
Highway 6, stood historic Blair
Hall, a longtime fixture on the
Grinnell campus. Plans were to
leave the intricately architectured
exterior of Blair alone and to re
model the interior into an ad-
ministration building. Later, the
whole building was razed to make
room for Burling Library. '

Adjacent to Blair on the east
was to be a T-shaped editice
which was actually a combine.
[ion of two Structures —- a Fine
Arts building to house facilities
for art, music, speech, and drama,
and a LOGO-seat auditorium. These
two buildings seem to have been
similar to the Roberts Theater-
Fine Arts complex which stands
today, though they were consider
ably farther east.

A memorial archway to provide
entrance to the campus was drawn
just off Highway Six, between
Mears and the proposed building
[or Fine Arts, but east of the
Mi&Sl:.L. tracks. Tile arch was
“available for construction as a
class gift."

Random features that dlfier in»
terestiligly from today's campus
were the stationing of the ﬂag
pole before Blair Hall, next to the
highway, and the use of the soccer
field as a parking lot. In addition.
two incongruous-looking rows of
lights ﬂanked Ward Field, and the

 

,tenlatlve scheme was to smtch
l.il:i‘.»‘_ - ..

the location of the power plant
and 3&6 offices to the site of the
new intramural field, immediately
east. of the railroad tracks and
north of Tenth Avenue.

The ASRrB declared that the

"Campus 0! the Future" would
“contain all the educational facili-
ties necessary for the optimum
education of 1,100 men and wom-
en." But “optimums” obviously
change.

Hungu Views American Brutality

(Continued from Page 3)

also by the establishment of the
forces which cut down the in-
nocent personalities of John F.
Kennedy, Medgar Evers, Mal-
colm X, the Negro children in
a Birmingham Sunday school
class, and other numerous bru-
talities that are so characteris-
tic of American everyday life
at large. To the free African
these are the forces of imper-
ialism and colonialism, the
forces he hates most. He knows
that they are the same type
of forces which killed Africa’s
beloved Patrice Lumumba. Af-
ter all it’s the burial of these
forces that we 'celebrate on
every independence anniver-
sary. We will never voluntar-
ily allow ourselves to be de-
voured by them again for the
second time. We are free, a
fact which every good African,
black or white, knows. We are
on the move to free the whole
of Africa; we know someday
all Africa will be free! The
words of my country’s Prime
Minister, vocalizcd on the oc-
casion of Malawi’s admission
into the United Nations, have
great meaning, “History has
shown that no peoples can be
held in subjugation forever.”
And so nobody will!

What confounds the African
Negro even more is how a
country so professedly dedi‘
cated to the virtues of freedom,

 

liberty and justice (whatever
these terms mean) can still
have Clarkism as its sheriff. If
by any means you think I don’t
understand the situation, which
is probably true everything
confounds me, please talk to
me that I may understand! I
am here to understand not Only
academic America but current
America 100. So let's know
each other, knowing itself won't
hurt at all.

However, in spite of all the
inhumanity that goes on here,
African pastors pray day and
night that America may be-
come a better place for all hu-
manity; and also that America
may come to our aid when we
embark on that step to destroy
and abolish the horse and rider
racial relationship that stenches
all Angola, Mozambique, Rho.
desia, South Africa, and some
other parts of the “civilized"
world. For those of you who
don’t know about the horse and
rider relationship, the African
is the one under the saddle,
and the one on the saddle is the
European or anyone who can
easily be mistaken for a Euro-
pean.

Whether the pastors' prayers
are being received by the God
of all humanity, we’ll know bet-
ter in due time. But I think the
earlier we know the better for
all concerned, believers or un-
believers, pagans or nonpa-
gans. . '

Union Committee Announces Changes
In Furniture, South Lounge Lighting

Various changes in the lighting
policy of the Forum were made at
last week’s meeting of the ad hoc
union committee, according to
Palmer Hartl, social coordinator.

The lights in the South Lounge
will be dimmed in the evenings, at
10:00 on weeknights and all eve-
ning on Friday and Saturday,
“conducive to quiet conversation
rather than a studyhall atmos-
phere," Hartl said. He said this
was consistent with the policy that
the Forum should be used as a
“recreation hall.”

The lights in the North Lounge,
with the exception of the outside
border, will be tumed off in the
evenings. And the blinking lights
will go, too. Hartl said that the
lights will be “flashed” once at
five minutes before women's hours
each evening.

On the lower level there will be
some changes, too. The committee
affirmed its statement that some
light must be present in the din-
ing rooms when they are in use.
but said that candle light would
be satisfactory.

Food and furniture were also
topics of conversation at the meets
ing. It was explained that the in-
creased prices for doughnuts in
the grill (two for 15 cents) is

necessitated by the upkeep costs
of the iancy grill. It was also an-
nounced that more furniture will
be purchased for the now»darkened
North Lounge.

The ad hoc union committee is
composed of Mrs. Jewell Hawk.
Forum director; Georgia Dentel,
activities counselor; S. Eugene
Thompson, dean of men; Jean M.
Slocum, dean of women; Fred
Huggins, Saga unit manager; Mere
ritt c. Ludwig, vice president of
the college; Steve Buckles, union
committee chairman; Peggy Zieg-
enhagen; Keith King; and Hartl.
The purpose of the committee is
“to review policy decisions on the
new Forum," Hartl said.

Steve (Beaver) Buckles, union
committee chairman. has an
nounced that the committee would
like to encourage the use of the
private dining rooms in the
Forum. He emphasized that the
private dining rooms are open to
groups of students, as well as to
clubs at 25 cents per person. Res-
ervations should be made by Fri-
day of the week preceding the din-
ner with Mrs. Hawk.

The (lining rooms are also availr
able for committee use during the
(layer evening. .Bllckles said.

liberoI'Arts Study
For Adult Students

No examinations, no papers to
turn in, no credits or grades.

This is the prospect facing those
attending Grinnell’s second annual
Liberal Arts institute for Adults,
scheduled for Sunday, June 6,
through Saturday, June 12.

Dale B. Terry, registrar and
director of the institute, said the
program has been designed to
provide adult students with a week
of leisurely yet formal study in the
liberal arts.

Terry said four hours of instruc-
tion each day plus special evening
lectures and other activities are
planned. Students will enroll in
two of the four courses offered, and
will be lnstructed by regular mem-
bers of the Grinnell faculty.

Terry said the institute will be
held in the air-conditioned facili-
ties of the college’s Fine Arts Cen-
ter, Hurling Library, and College
Forum.

Courses and instructors are:

“Music in America,” Professor
Denis M. de Coteau (music).

Dangerous Dynamics—The Poli-
tics oi Developing Nations,” pro
fessor James S. Magee (political
science).

“Education for What?" Profes~
sor Reginald D. Archembault (ed-
ucation and philosophy).

“Literature: Characteristics and
Values,” Professor Andrew P. De»
bickl (humanities).

Supplementary evening lectures
will be delivered by Myron M. Lib-
erman (English), Guillermo Men-
doza (biology). and Neal w.
Klausner (philosophy).

A piano recital by Professor
Richard E. Howe (music), will
be presented Sunday night before
classes start.

 

their credit cards," he said. The
college has a serious public rela-
tions problem, Dixon said, “which
is of a nature to threaten the very
things we cherish.” But, he added.
the problem might be created by
the things we cherish.

A Stanford University scandal
over sexual misconduct, triggered
with the publication of a special
student report in the Stanford
Daily, culminated with the resig-
nation of Stanford Dean of Wom-
en Lucille Allen. The report said,
“She (Dean Allen) attributed some
of the problems which occur
among freshmen to salacious ma-
terials they study in Freshman
English and to the erotic ap-
proach adopted by many of the
younger professors . . . They con-
centrate deliberately on the erotic
aspects of literature, in part be-
cause those who are unmarried use
literature as their sexual outlet,
and in part because they wish to
seduce the girls in their classes

 

. . . The professors exercise con-
trol over the girls by virtue of
their grading power; and they can
intimidate a girl who will not com-
ply with their wishes."

Cornell University student:
pirated the Princeton University
newspaper Friday, February 26,
and replaced it with a forgery re—
porting that all-America basket—
ball star Bill Bradley was injured
and would miss the crucial game
against Cornell Saturday. "it was
a pretty good copy," Princetonian
editor John Kretzman Said. “Only
people who know something about
newspapers would detect the dif-
ference.”

Cornell University and the Dis-
trict Attorney of Tompkins Coun-
ty are investigating the use of
marijuana among Comell stu-
dents. University officials do not
yet know how many students are
taking marijuana, but they believe
that some organized narcotics ring
is distributing reefers on campus.

Distinguished GuestI
Discusses Polymers

By Susan Barquist

Dr. Charles Overberger was
greeted by a record tumrout as
he addressed the Gl’innell stu-
dent affiliate chapter of the
American Chemical Society last
Friday afternoon. Dr. Over-
berger, professor of organic
chemistry and dean oi science
at Polytechnic Institute of
Brooklyn and director of the
Polymer Research Institute,
spoke on the chemistry of mar
cromolecules.

Dr. Overberger summarized
the problems to be tackled in
polymer chemistry and then
discussed two particular, cur
rent research projects.

The basic process in polymer
or macromolecule chemistry
is “making large molecules out
of small ones." Molecules can
be induced to farm chains and
networks of chains by several
methods. In general a catalyst
is used.

In studying polymer reactions
there are several areas of in-
teresL: end groups, chemical
structure, dis t r i bution of
chains, and stereochemistry
(the relative position of atoms
or groups of atoms in a mole-
cule). The last category is that
in which the greatest recent
progress has been made. There
are a variety of ways a given
group can arrange itself in a
molecule. Often a catalyst will
direct this arrangement in a
specific way. These arrange-
ments (configurations) each
have their own properties and
characteristics, Important re-
search questions include: 1)
how can it be shown that pre—
ferred conformations exist in
solutions as well as in crystals,
2) what is the influence of stero-
chemistry on physical proper-
ties. 3) how is it possible to
change stereo structure by us»
ing dilrerent catalysts.

The two specific research pra-
jECts discussed dealt with opti-
cal properties of a synthetic
protein molecule and the cata-
lytic effect of an enzyme re-
moved from natural conditions.

3120171. Jim, ﬂavor,

By Sue Johnson

Back In the days when Vic-
toria ruled in England and
Gates ruled at Grinnell, issues
or the 5&3 reflected the in.

fluence of both the aiore-men-
honed personages. Despite the
astounding number of varia<
tions on two themes (”John
Q. Student received a
visit from his parents on Sun-
day” and “Purity Pays"), the
189971900 5&3 did manage to
scrape up a few items worth
the paper on which it was
printed.

At that timE. Grinnell was
still known as Iowa College and
was divided into three branches
of study: Group System of
Studies, lowa College Academy,
and Iowa College School of Mn-
sic. In 1899, after a reception
for the men students new to
Iowa College, it was reported.
“President Gates then gave one
at his valuable talks, emphasiz-
ing the purity of social life
among college students."

The library at the turn of the
century was located in Good-
now hall, and one editorial
reads, “The dark, cloudy days
of the past weeks have em-
phasized again the need of hav—
ing Goodl‘low hall lighted.” It
is interesting to note that no
such protest was made about
the chapel buildlng, in which
social gatherings were held.

The sophomore class of 1900
showed one of the highly intro
quent bursts ot devilishness
when it rallied and locked the
freshman class out of the
chapel building on the night of
the freshman class party.

At one of its meetings the
Calocogathia Society discussed
the private lives of “present
day rulers." Included were the
czar of Russia, Wi iam of Ger-
many, and “Queen Victoria and
her ramily lire". . .0)

Showing a typical 1965 vote
of confidence in the intellect
and reason of the student body,
one of the editorials of 1900
reads. “The election of Dr. F.
K. Sanders to succeed Pre -
dent Gates was announced this
week. While the students are
not qualified to select a man
tor president, and their judg-
ment in regard to such a selec-
tion could be questioned, no
one doubts but that they thor-
oughly appreciate the task
that was before the trustees to
ﬁnd a man to take up the work
where President Gates leaves
it”

Another editorial advocates
social reforms:

“In a faraway land, where,

people have strange ways and
look askance at customs much
different from ours, there was
once a nice little college in a

 

nice little town. This little col~
lege had always prided itselt on
its reputation ot living in a
pure, clean atmosphere, and or
preserving a comparatively
high standard of morality,
which, tradition said, had been
maintained since the beginning
of its history."

But one day ﬂier: was a foot~
ball game. A team tron-i a
neighboring institution came
over to this little college and
played for the championship.
The game was very onersided,
and the home team had small
trouble in winning a decided
victory.

“But, during the progress of
the game and as the final re-
sult became more certain, the
visitors on the gridiron and
along the side lines grew ir—
ritated and, being further ot-
fended by sundry flagrant visa
lations of scientific football in
their own team, gave vent to
their teelings in language loud
and strong

”It was said they swore —
and awlully, too — oaths which
were plainly heard from the
grandstand. This hurt the feel—
ings of the little college. The
little college rather thought
that, out of respect to the ladies
present, such language ought
not be used.

“But, oh no! not in that tar-
pwoy land where people have
strange, oh such strange ways.
Surely the little college has
ideals too high; if it could see
games in our Own land, where
loud swearing is oilen a fea«
ture, it would adopt more liba
eral standards. But then this
all took place in a land far, fal‘
away. . ."

And long, long ago.

College Presidents—
The Great Search

The search goes on and Grin-
nell, obviously, remains with-
out a president.

But then, selecting a presi-
dent is a tricky business and,
according to the Alumni 5&3,
- mysterious one “enveloped in
n shroud of secrecy and intrigue
worthy of a James Bond thrill-
or.”

And while it is difficult to
imagine what could possibly
be intriguing about selecting
a college president that would
make the search worthy of a
James Bond thriller, the
Alumni 5&3 clarified by say-
ing that the search was usual-
ly "on a rather higher intellec-
tual plane" than the Bond
books—which is easy to imag~
ins.

An article by Maurine Hoff-
man in a recent edition of the
Washington Post makes one
hope that the intellectual plane
spoken of by the Alumni sea
is maintained.

The article said, among other
things, that if the presidential
appointee of a college “works
out," it is often a “matter of
luck."

The biggest failing of college
trustees in looking for a presi—
dent, said the Post, was that
they “waste time seeking a
‘paragon of human virtues} "

One university was report-
edly looking for a man who
was a “distinguished scholar"
of “demonstrated executive
ability,” “prepared to head a
multi»millionrdollar business”
and “able to get along with the
alumni, faculty, students and
the board of trustees."

The Grinnell Board of True»
tees may have to settle for
something less.

And meanwhile the search
goes on.

Grinnell’s Great Gadget—Makes Doughnuts

By Don Winney

Great inventions have dra-
matically changed the course
of history. The steam engine,
the cotton gin, the diaper—ail
have supported society in times
of need. And now, amidst edu-
cation’s never-ending battle for
tmth, justice, and prestige,
Grinnell has a new symbol of
automated successi the dough-
nut machine.

Looking like a modern sculp-
ture of unmitigated junk, the
Sage. Cyclops splotches out
about three doughnuts per stuA
dent every morning at Cowles.
That's forty-five dozen an hour
—enough to cause any dough-
nut craftsman to change his
whole outlook on life In fact,
with its prefabricated infinity,
the machine, if used widely,
could lay off hundreds of dough-

nutvhoie makers.

Instead of laying off any
Saga workers, the doughnut
robot has actually created a
new and vital Saga position—
assistant headwaiter of dough
nuts, For someone must mix
the special ingredients and
push the magic button; some
one must supervise this highly
classiiied task. Such a man, be-
cause of the important nature
of his work, will remain anony-
mous here.

According to informed and
reliable sources, throughout the
Saga hierarchy he is knOWn
esoterically as “The Doughnut
King.” The King commences his
work each morning at six»thir-
ty. Furtively he rereads the
secret Saga doughnut formula.
one of Grinnell's most closely
guarded secrets. Then, slowly

and carelessly, he mixes the
batter and pours it into the ma-
chine. A red light blinks, and
the moment of truth arrives as
doughnuts drip from the eye of
the machine into a long frying
pan. The King smiles paternal»
ly, steps back, and watches an
act of creation. Right now he
is working faithfully for the
Golden Doughnut Award, beA
stowed to the maker of five
hundred dozen doughnuts or
more in a single week.

This feat may prove diffi»
cult to accomplish if the $650
monster blows another circuit,
as it did when it was in—
stalled. Now it’s grinding away
in grand fashion.

But: to subjective observers,
there’s something sinister in
that grinding, for a careful ex-
amination of the doughnuts roll-

ing lorti'l reveals a startling and
highly significant fact. They are
all made of tickytacky and all
come out the same. Perhaps
this conformity is in some way
symbolic Perhaps there is g
deeper profundity to be graspe
here by intense intellectual dia~
logucs between students and
faculty. In a very real sense,
is the doughnut machine a sym’a
bol for the reality of our times?
Is the doughnut machine ltseﬁ
reality? Furthermore, is reality
reality? No doubt these momen-
tous questions will someday be
answered by Grinnell scholar»
ship. Meanwhile the Golden
Doughnut Award is just around
the next hole.

'Herzog's Lust Sland'

Ed. Note: Thu iollowing is or
cei'pled irom a speech Jim
i-lerzog delivered to the student
Senate on Feb. 24.

For the past two and a halt
years, i have been distressed by
the direction and attitudes of
this college regarding sociarrulcs.
My actions and reactions in re-
lponse to these rules have been
essentially negative. 1 have_ op»
posed specific rules and actions,
and even opposed the overall phil-
osophy which has brought the rules
Ind actions.

My design {or a college is an
ideal, and it is this ideal which
I have sought and still seek: a
fine educational institution which
does not attempt to impose a tight
curb on the intellectual and social
habits, desires and thoughts at
the students. _

I see a college which is es-
lentially without any social re-
strictions, other than the laws
which govern the outside world.
The, laws I would envision at n
‘college are laws against damage
and drunkeness; that is, laws
which prevent people from infring-
ing on the lives and rights at
others. . _

This grind design implies an
absence of rule! that inhibit er-
.Iollal freedom—rules that II ow

college whit thinks and act! 13%
itlvely, 1 can see no Idn'linistn-
tor asking girls it they lrn‘preg-
nant, no administrator dismissing,
suspending or placing student: on
probation without due process, no
administrltor allowing resident: of
a college to ply for the depreci~
ation of college property out at
l “social" fund, no administrator
saying cars are evil when Henry
Ford long ago proved moiety
would accept them,

Uniertunately. many of the con-
trols, restrictions, and unnecessary
altitudes to which I object have
been manifested at Grinnell Col»
lege. Here we have rules which
prohibit everything train cottec
makers to motor vehicles. Each
rule has its own rationale, and
each is a tribute to the motherly
concern this college Ill! for its
Iludents.

My feeling is that the college
administration has been static, un-
yielding, and distrustful of stu-
dents during the past yelr. The
Student Sennte, the student courtl,
and the student executive officers
are but ineﬂectull voices in the
wilderness. The college administra-
tion has decided on Whit it Want!
and is bending I! lwiftly I! in

The method! of the administrator!
are strong and harsh. The various
crises of this year sire morn ser-
ious than in past years, And yet,
Dean Thompson warned Lingan
Hall, “If you think you already
have seen arbitrary action, you
haven‘t seen anything yet,”

From the top to the boltum the

 

various student representatives, of-
ticcrs and executives have become
but pawns of a college which ap~
parently is singlermindedly head-
ing towards a more narrow, more
restricted community, This com
munity is unattractive to me,

During the past two years Grim
nell’s student government officers
have been disturbed and have
Ll'led to pomsy the crises beloro
students. The effort has been, for
the most part, in vain. The stile
dents have tallcd to see crises
and the general change in the
tenor of the community.

I would bid student government
to dissolve. This seems the only
powerlul weapon we have left. I
would bid the students to coniront
the administration as a cohesive
body which no longer recognizes
the rules imposed by the admin-
istration.

Let the halls regulate their own
lives, Let the student government
operate informally without alleg-
iance tn the deans. Let the dean
of women make her own bed-
cllecks every night. Let the deal"
police open dorms. If there is no
due recess, then let there be no
one liable to face the harsh author-
ity of the college administration.

Let us demonstrate clearly in
all that the phrases in the co lege

Animal Lilo

Changes Proposed In [M B'Imll

By Jim Ramsey a
Nick Nonas

Since our last column, we
have come under considerable
criticism for not confining our
remarks to the IM program.
Our reasons for straying from
what the sole subject matter
of Animal Life has been in the
past are twofold. First, the pur-
pose of any column should
be to point out issues of inter-
est to the readers. Let's face it.
A drab weekly, playsby-piay
description of the basketball
games are less than thought
provoking and even less enter-
taining. Mayor issues which con-
cern all of us involved in the
program do not arise that often.
Secondly, it is our observation
that Animal Life, even in its
more serious and critical tones,
has had little, if any, effect on
City Hall—on those people in a
responsible position who can
act on a recommendation! How-
ever, we feel compelled this
week to devote all our energies
to a problem which must be
alleviated ii the 1M basketball
program is not to evolve into
one of the most hilarious de-
bacles of the year, In hopes
that our pleas for help will not
fall on deaf ears, but will
reach someone who will listen
and ACT, We address this let-
ter directly to City Hall.

Dear Mr. Pfitsch:

How long has it been since
you have taken a critical look
at, or made a serious evalua-
tion‘of the 1M basketball pro-
gram, and, in particular, the
officiating. If you could restrain
your laughter long enough to
consider the absurdity and in-
consistency of so many of the
calls, as ludicrous as they
might be, you might realize
that beneath the veil of amuse—
mom, a very serious problem
exists. It’s not quite so funny
when you’re laying on your
back, looking up at the foot
standing on your face, and hear
the referee call a jumpball.
Instances of this sort are too
many to enumerate. The prob-
lem is quite obvious to us who
bear bruises and injustices of
the game, and it is apparent
that the issue has not been
called to your attention. We
are sure that if you witnessed
some of these farces, your em-
pirical observations w o u l d
place you in hearty agreement
with us.

Before making any serious
recommendations, let it be said
that the crux of the problem
lies, not with the referees, but
in the very nature of the bris-
iietball program itself, In spite
of the incessant criticism which
any reieree is apt to receive, a

great deal of credit must go
to those men who “stick their
necks on the block” merely be-
cause their hall needs to pro-
vide a referee or sacrifice en-
try points. Unfortunately, as
the program is designed, a
horse could be given a Whistle,
if he represented a hall, and,
in some cases, it might be an
improvement

This cursory sketch of the
problem is all too brief, but let
it suffice to make our point, On
this, we urge most strongly
that the following persausions
be implemented, or at least lay
the groundwork for a revision
of the 1M basketball program.

First, as the situation pres-
ently exists, any 1M player (in
fact, it need not be a player or
even an enthusiast) can referee
a game, irrespective of the fact
that he might be unable to dis-
tinguish a basketball from a
pineapple or a foul from a bas-
ket, which would seem to be
the case in some instances. We
realize that the concept of an
officiating clinic has been tossed
around for some time. We also
realize that not one thing has
been done towards implement
ing it into the program, and
that it still remains an idle
dream, To our way of thinking,
the clinic should be more than
available—it should be compul-
sory for any referee who uffic<
iates an IM game. This is the
only way to procure the con—
sistent and capable officiating
which is now so sorely lacking,

Secondly, the monetary com-

pensation, which is now $.50 a,

game, might be distributed on

an alternative basis. There are,,
we feel, enough players with'

an interest and background in
IM basketball to participate in
a referee’s pool, At the begin-
ning of each season, these ill-
terested persons would be en-
listed info a group, of say 15
men, who would each officiate
three or four games a week on
a rotating schedule, The total
wages available for referee’s
compensation would be divided
among these personnel. They
would, in turn, be trained at
the clinic, consisting of at least
four one-hour sessions.
Certainly these recommenda—

tions are not the only to which'

you have recourse. But we of-
fer them as the most cogent
solutions which we can present.
Perhaps these particular sug-
gestions represent the views of
a minority of north campus, but
we feel that we are almost
unanimously accompanied in
our supplications for a drastic
revision 01' the officiating pro-
gram. It is about time that a
serious interest was taken in

 

the 90% of north campus that
does not participate in winter
varsity athletics, and are not
gifted enough physically to play
varsity basketball, If you have
neither the interest nor the
time, we beg of you, for the
sake of the TM program and all
of us involved, now and in the
future, to turn the program
over to some member of the
department who is sincerely
concerned and m oti v ate d
enough to do something about
it.

Sincerely yours,

ANIMAL LIFE

Swimmers Prepare
For Midwest Meet

Grinnell, edged out 5045 by Cor-
nell in the battle for “Dilly the
Duck,, last Saturday, will be look-
ing for revenge when the two clubs
collide again this weekend in the
Midwest Conference meet at
Northfield, Minn.

Carleton Will host the Friday-
Saturday meet in its new zayard.
six lane pool.

"We hope to get even this week‘
end at Carleton," said Coach Irv
Simone, who is counting on the
Cornell loss to provide his Pio-
neei's with an extra incentive. The
loss was the first of the year for
the mermen after eight wins. Core
hell is unbeaten.

Should Grinnell and Cornell slip,
Beloit could carry off top honors.
Bill Putnam is unbeaten in the
zoo. and 500-yard freestyle and
Ted Sheldon is a possible Champ-
ion in the 50 and 100. They are
also mainstays on the Bucs' allr

Frantz Will Break School Record

As Hoopsters Close Home Season

Jeff Frantz is almost certain to
let a new Grinnell College season
scoring record when the Pioneer
basketball team closes its home
campaign with three games in
five days.

Coach John Pfitsch‘s crew will
host Monmouth at 7:30 pm. to-
night, Knox at 4 p.m. tomorrow,
and Cornell at 1:30 pm. Tuesday.

A 6~2 junior forwardrguard,
Frantz has rammed in 411 points
in the Pioneers' first 17 tilts for a
24.2 average and is only 34 shy of
the school mark of 445 set by John
Musser in 195455. He leads the
Midwest Conference with a 23.8
average on 310 points in 13 appear-
Ances.

Frantz's‘name is already prom-
Inently displayed in the Grinnell
record book. He set a new sopho-
more standard of 391 points a year
ago and earlier this season claimed
new single game point (46) and
field goal (22) marks.

In addition, Frantz leads the
pioneers in the rebounding depart-
ment with 158 and is a defensive
standout. His performances have
been about the only bright spots in
an otherwise drab season that has
seen Grinnell win only six of 17
games. Now 479 in the Midwest
Conference, the loopsters are only
one-half game out of the cellar.

While the Pioneers have a re
epectable 4'3 mark at home, they
have lost eight of 10 games on the
toad, including the last six.

Joining Frantz in the starting
lineup for the Monmouth, Knox,
and Cornell tilts will be the team’s
two other consistent scorers, for-
ward Tom Hill and guard Elliott
Hibhs, both sophomores. Hill has
tallied 2M markers for a 13.2 av-
erage and Hibbs has collected 217
for a 12.8 average.

The other two starters will come
among senior forward - center
Clyde Smith, junior forward-cen-
ter Ted Risser, and sophomore
guard Bob Watt.

Smith and Risser, at 673 the tall-
est Pioneers, have both been in
scoring slumps recently and have
seen their averages drop to 8.1
and 7.1, respectively. Watt has a
an average.

The annual highlight of the Grinnell winter sports season occurs
this weekend as the swimming, wrestling, and indoor track conference
meets take place at various midwest locations. In recent years the
Pioneers have fared quite well in these meets, and with a little luck
they should do so again this year.

The swimming team travels to Northfield to splash around in
Carleton's new pool, There are apparently three teams with a shot at
the title — Beloit, Cornell, and Grinnell. The Ploneers defeated Beloit
and lost to Cornell on a disqualification in dual meets. Conference
meets are a different story, however, and dual meets cannot be used
to predict the outcome. John Kraai, Tony Horton, Ken Adelman, and
Ralph Pray should lead the Pioneer assault. It will be, in any event,
an exciting meet which could easily be decided at the finale in the
400-yard freestyle relay. All three of the contenders have true teams
in the event and they could ﬁnish within a body length of each other.

The wrestling team, meanwhile, will he in Monmouth carrying
the Scarlet and Black flag, possibly without the services of their cap—
tain Larry Miller. Miller was iniured last weekend, and thus Bill
Barnes and Ken Stl'ubler in the lighter weights and Marty Ringo and
Morgan Michel in the heavier weights will have to give the team
needed points. Two Grinnellians who could surprise are Mike Death-
erage and Gary Wilson. It is not known whether Wilson is eligible,
for he just transferred back to Grinnell alter a semester at West
Point. At any rate, Cornell, Monmouth, Carleton, and Grinnell are
contenders with Cornell cast in the favorites role.

The track team is traveling to Chicago for its conference meet,
which Grinnell has Won the last three years in a row. Running in the
meet, in addition to the ten conference schools, is the University of
Chicago, which seems to be head and shoulders above the conference
teams. The Pioneers can still win the conference championship, how-
ever, if they can outrun the Midwest Conference teams and finish sec-
ond to Chicago. The troops are somewhat depleted this season in
numbers, and thus they are only entered in three relays instead of the
usual five. Paul Patterson, Steve Brintnall, John TePaske and Mike
DeWitt should provide strength in the running events while Tom
Wood and Jim Miller should score well in the field events. Carleton,
Monmouth, Cornell, and Grinnell should be in the race for honors in
track.

 

DON'T SLIP OR SPIN!

Collum'

By Bob Henderson

One hundred swimming devotees
packed the Grinnell Water Arena
to capacity last Saturday to see
the formerly undefeated Pioneer
varsity swimmers receive their
first setback of the season from
the stillrunbeaten Cornell Rams.

in 20 years of rivalry, this was
only the second victory that Cor-
nell has been able to take from
the Pioneer mermen.

The Rams took the lead and the
victory in the last event of the af-
ternoon, the ADD-yard freestyle re-
lay. The linal tally was 5045.

Had it not been for a disqualifi-
cation in the final event, Grinnell
would have clinched at least a tie
for the conference crown. The ju-
biiant Pioneer anchor man finished
four lengths ahead of his Cornell
pursuer only to find that his team
had been disqualified.

Contrary to pre-meet speculation,
only three records were broken,
two of them by Cornell. Cornell’s
Tom Steinberg set a new pool rec,
ord of 5142.2 in the 5mryard free-
style, while teammate Jim Green
sprinted the ZOO-yard freestyle for
a new pool mark,

Grinnell’s freshman Steve Holtze
showed promise of being a valu-
able addition to next year's var-
sity by setting a new school and
pool record in the loo-yard indi-
vidual medley with a time of
1:455. In addition to the new rec-
ord, Holtze won the ZOO-yard back-
stroke and Zoo—yard breaststroke
events for the freshmen.

Despite an almost tragic mis-
calculation of points in the diving
event and numerous false starts
in other events, the Grinnell team
was able to cop first place honors
in diving, the zoo-yard butterfly,

 

yard breaststroke, and the 4%
yard medley relay.

Winners in the individual events
were Richard Lance, Ken Adel-
man, Tony Horton, and John
Kraai, respectively. By winning
the ADO-yard medley relay, Grin-
nell gave the Ram team its first:

Other Pioneers with good prosa
pects of taking points in the con.
ference meet at Carleton tomor-
row are Ralph Pray (Zooryard and
EOOryard freestyle), Bill Lontz (60-
yard treestyle), and Rog Abenr
dl'oth (diving).

Frosll to End Year
Willi Knox Yearlings

Tomorrow aftemoon at 1:00 the
promising freshman hoopsters try
to improve their a and 2 record
against a strong Knox quintet.
Following their fourth Victory
(over Saga) Tuesday, coach An-
derson feels his freshman five is
ready for a peak performance
with all members of the squad
scheduled to see action. A winning
season would be the first in sev-
eral years for a fresh ball club.

Eager to avenge last week’s loss
to Cornell, the starting five which
has played well throughout most
of the season will be Mike Sch<
wartz and Jim Poison at guards,
Roger Able at center, and Greg
Rankin and Dick Musser at for-
wards. With all five starters av-
eraging in double figures, the team
is averaging over at) points a game
and should display a fast-moving
offense as well as a bustling de-
tense.
