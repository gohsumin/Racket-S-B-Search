HHa/aina hoot Student Body  

By Ruth Gruenivnld
(leature editor)
A week of campaign politiek»
ing ended last Monday as Btll
Halama, Coivles junior, became
president ot the Grinnell Stu-
dent Body. winning by a ma—
jority of 147 votes (Hala‘mai
462, Thomson—31o), he now
faces the task or putting the
new constitution into actual
plactlce,
Halama will take office on
Wednesday according to the old
-constitution, since the new one
has not yet been l‘atlficd by
President Bowen.
“The main concern between
now and spring vacation,"
says Ilalania, “will lie the
transition to the new form or
government.”
The election results are in a
sense a vote or confidence lor
the present Student Council
administration; Halaina's plats
torin boars more resemblance to
Krulilike’s ideas than did either
of the other candidate His
concern over NSA and the
whole realm or national alrairs
indicates that perhaps the “yr-d
of the student.” is not yet ov.

It remains to be seen whether
or not Halama can bring the
necessary qualities of leadership
and judgment to the ‘presidency.
He sees the role oi' student
body president as an active one,
combmlng coordiatioii w i t h
leadership.

"An active president," said
Halama, rings new and trash
ideas to the Council; he acts
as an intitator.”

Halnma considers the two
anain problems coni‘ronting
, the council to be making a
su- es ~tul and iimnettnitc
tran‘ on to the new iorm
or government and maintain-
, ing the precedent sctin cunsitlr
oration oi national issues.

Some oi his immediate plans
include the setting up or a his
dieial committee to go over pie»
cedcnts set by the AWS Board
and CufHP in Judicial matters,
a meeting or all people inter—
.ested in applying for the posi-
tion or Senate speaker in order
to discuss what the lot) will ens
tail, and the setting up or a
committee to study the best way
in which a transition ii-om the
old to the new court system
should be made.
Halama said that .
“the advice of people who have
been carrying out itidicial func-
tions valuable.”

Castro-land I

Duringr Christmas Vacation, Jim Gilbert, 21 senior at

Carleton College, spent ten days in what the American,
press calls “Castro-land.“ Since travel to that island is‘

now prohibited by the United States government, Gilbert
and the editors of this paper feel that some of his observa-

tions are worth sharingr with students who are no longer,

permitted to see for themselves what is going on,

_ Together with 380 other Americans, students, houses
\i'ives, working people, businessmen and families, Gilbert
went on a special tour sponsored by the Fair Play for
Cuba Committee.

The stur,’ printed below first appeared in Carleton's
paper The Carletonitln, and caused quite a stir there. At
a coffee hour next Sunday, Gilbert, and Howard Weinstein,
' tirlent f oln Chicago who also iterl Cuba not long ago,
Villl discuss their views 01' the ’land, and slides will be
shown. The presentation will provide seine first hand back-
ground for the coming; Latin American Conference. This
is one you shouldn’t miss.

Senior Comps

The Grinnell English depart-
ment has disclosed some changes
in the pattern or comprehensive
examinations tor majors in that
department,
According
ment by
chairman

to an announce
Sheldon P. Zitiier,
or the department,
these changes will not affect
current senior majors in any
way. Majors who are now jun~
iors will have the choice of
proceeding under the old plan
or comprehensive examinations
or under the new setup.

All students majoring in
either literature or journalism
will take a common examination
on 21 announced texts. Journal-
ism students will, in addition
to this exam, write two exams
in journalism.

Literature maiors will be
examined on two topics chosen
irom lists established by the
English department. These stus
dents must declare the topics
upon which they are to be ex-
amined not later than the begins
ning of the second semester oi
their junior year.

The department feels that
this new pattern of comprehen—
sive exams will help promote
the studentsl mastery of the
chronicle or literature and pre-
vent the development of pre—
mature specialization.

tion for every citizen a reality, ‘

That evening we stopped at Playa Giant AS We pulled into

iis everywhere. Over 3,000 people had waited all afternoon to
see the Americans who came as friends. We walked to the city
hall, and we received an honorary Cuban flag. The people be-
gan the chants that characterize the revolution "venccremas"
(we shall succeed). But instead of “Cuba si, Yankee no,” some
one started chanting, “Cuba si, Yankee si, lmpcrlallsmo_no,”
Perhaps. if anything, these Six words characterize the attitude
which I found that Cubans have toward Americans. They want
very much to be our friends, and they hold nothing against the
citizens of the U. S., but they feel at they have very well»
founded grievances with American business interests and with
the American Government.

There are several questions which Americans are asking
about Cuba. Perhaps because of the reading 1 have done and
because of my trip to that country, 1 can suggest possible aris—
wers.

IF CUBA WANTS PEACE, THEN ,WHY DOES SHE SEEM
BELLIGERENT? WHY DOES SHE PREPARE FOR lNVAs-
IONS WHEN NO INVASIONS SEEM LIKELY?

The answer to this is simpler than most people believe. in
the first place. Cubans know Latin American history. They ii.-
member such things as the Flatt. amendment, and above all the

Alnericansenglneered overthrow of the government in Guatemala
about a years ago. They also have more information about our
present actions in Latin America than American Citizens do. They
have long known about our secret training base in Guatemala
first reported in the Nation, The New York Times, and finally
the Jan. 27 issue of Times magazine. Time has this to say about
the subject “The Erente tcounter.revolutionary organization)
is making impressive preparations: guerilla training camps in
Florida and Guatemala, arms-carrying FT boats that average a
trip a week to Cuba, an air group of some so flycrs who report-
edly fly out of the mystery field at Retalheleu in Guatemala and
the inactive U. 5. Marine Corps Cpa Locka airbase in Florida
. . . The Prente apparently gets all the U. S, financial aid to
Cuba's underground (estimated to range from $135,000 monthly
to as high as $500,000 on occasions) . . . i, l

It seems unlikely that U s. Marines will invade Cuba, but
if counter-revolutionarics trained on our soil and paid by our
tax money land in Cuba, is it any less an invasion by that
United States? By constantly announcing to the world that
the United States is financing invaders and itself plans to in-
vade, Castro very effectively makes an invasion impossmlei
world opinion would never allow it.

WHY, IF THE CUBA-N REVOLUTION lS DOING so
MUCH FOR THE PEOPLE, DOES THE UNITED STATES
OPPOSE 1T so VEHEMENTLY'I

This is, the hardest question to answer, for nothing which
can be posited seems rational, Some say that we oppose Castro
because he no longer allows freedom of the press and because
the revolutionary government has executed ooo war criminals
But can this be true when we support Batista with arms and
money to fight Castroiﬁatlsta who is reported to have murder-
ed zoiooo Cubans and tortured countless others"

If we are so worried about the forms of democracy why
do we support Spain, Portugal, Honduras. Formosa, Etc? The
answer must lie in Cuba’s actions toward the United States
What unique thing has Cuba done to us? Only one—they have
taken property away from American business concerns, some of
whom charged exorbitant prices and inadc ciiortmous profits
while doing almost nothing for the people of Cuba.

Was it worth it to allow starvation unemployment, disease
and illiteracy to continue to preserve the property rights 0[ a
few Americans. The people thought not, so they took over

American industry. The United States retaliated by its ecol‘iomic‘

embargo.

WHY Is THERE A TRAVEL BAN 0N CUBA?

The most common argument is that Cuba is dangerous and
that Cubans hate Americans. From my experience, 1 can say
that I did not find this to be true. Yet the real proof lies in a
comparison with other countries. It we are worried about the
safety of our citizens why don't we impose a travel ban on
Belbgium during the recent riots therefithere are no riots in
Cu 3.

Only those trips to Cuba are allowed which
best interests of the United States." Unfortunately the real aris—
wer to this question seems inescapable. The United States gov»
ernlnent does not. want Americans to see what is really happel‘h
mg in Cuba.

Several other questions arise from a study of the Cuban
situation. If we believe in the principles laid down in our Dace
lai-ation of independence and our Constitutionilhe basic rights
of man to life. liberty and the pursuit of happinessAthen why
do we try to destroy the Cuban Revolution? Why does our press,
which claims it is free and objective, print half-truths about

Cuba; wliv the emotion-packed epithets such as “Castro’s boissl

terous, lefteleanlng Cuba" and “Castro—land?”

Why does the pres leave out the story of what the l‘evolur
tion is doing for thc peoplel Why do we hate the Cuban Revolu-
tion when our own break with England brought confiscation of
property from counterrrevolutiunarlcs then called Tories? Are
we hypocrites, or are we just ignorant? is the United states
an arsenal of freedom as it claims, or is it just an arsenal?
