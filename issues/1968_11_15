Five Elected T0
Phi Beta Kappa

Honor Society

On Wednesday evening, Nov.
13, the presentation of the fall
Phi Beta Kappa awards and the
Sophomore Book Awards was
held in Grinnell House. Phi Beta
Kappa, a national Scholastic
honor society, elects members
twice a year at Grinnell. The
fall elections, which are limited
to the top 215% at the senior
class, are held, according to
Phi Beta Kappa Secretary John
Cl'ossett, so that the chapter
will include seniors who will be
going to Grinnell for another
semester after the award.

Tha ﬁve new Phi Beta Kappa
designates, elected earlier this
tall from a senior class of 262,
are Grant Crandall, Michael
Domjan, Eleonora Spiegel, Don-
ald Stump, and Nancy Young.

The teatureri speaker was
Miss Evelyn Gardner, Professor
Emerita of English and iormer
Dean of Women. Miss Gardner
based much or her speech on ex-
periences in India. Her topic
was “The Peacock Rider".

The membership certificates
and book awards were then
presented by Mr. William
Roecker, chapter president, and
Mr. Crossett.

Sophomore book awards went
to five students this fall, because
a tie between two girls prevents
ed the usual selection of the two
girls and two boys with the high-
est grade point average in the
class. Recipients were: Robert
Dorsett, Randy Price, Margaret
Schottstaedt, Susan Seeder, and
Margaret Wait.

The award, a $15 carte
blanche tor the purchase oi
books was not necessarily ln<
tended to buy one of Mr. Cros-
sett's books, Mr. Roecker as-
sured the sophomores.

Mild Earth Tremor
Disturbs Grinnell

Last Saturday orinnell
was a bit agitated by a
wave at an earthquake
which was centered in south-
ern Illinois.

The earthquake registered
a 5.5 on the Richter 10 point
scale tor earthquake inten-
sity. This was just under the
damage level oi 6.

While the quake caused no
damage, iui-niture and near
ly all buildings on campus
Shook. Only ARH was not
budged. (See cartoon on

College Gets New
Computer Service

A direct telephone line link—
ing Grinnell to the computer
at the University of Iowa’s
Computer Center was in
stalled Tuesday. This Remote
Data Terminal gives Grinnel-
Iians access to the IBM 2780
Computer in Iowa City,

included in the taciiity here
is a punch card reader. Punch
cards can also be made here
and then ted into the compu-
ter. The wide diversity of pro-
grams available for use, in.
cluding Fortran, RPG, and
Calm], provides a great deal of
"Computer Capability.”

At the present time, all
phases oi operations with the
computer are not completely
organized. Plans are still in
the beginning stages as to
what actually will be done
with the computer. Expansion
plans are being geared to be-
gin sometime in January.

The computer services are
currently being used by pro-
fessors and students indepcm
dently and by several classes.

The Monroe Hotel: Fiction, Elegy, and Satire

(First of two ports)

By MARK SABLEMAN and
PAUL ROTHMAN

Believe it or not, in down-
town Grinnell, there is a
building containing more his-
tory and more storybook leg-
end than one would assume
there could he in a town oi
this size. Reputed to be “the
largest wooden structure west
oi the Mississippi” at one
time, the Monroe Hotel, south
of the College on Park Street,
is surrounded by a mystique
that would bu hard to dupli-
cats anywhere.

The Monroe's iii‘st owner
was A Mrs. Gertrude Capron,
better known as “Old Lady
Capron." 1n the 1580’s and
1890's, just after she had come
to Grinncil from her native
New England, she bought in
building next to the railroad
tracks and made it into a ho-

tel. In 1898, she sold that hotel
and built a new one on the
east side of Park Street, be-
tween Josiah B. Grinnell's
house and the railroad tracks.
She gave this hotel her maid—
en name. Monroe, In 1908 or
1909. after J. B. Grinnell's
house had been moved south
on Park street to just past the
lumberyard, she built an ad-
dition on the north of the Hotel
which nearly tripled its capac.
ity.
Mutiny on the Bounty

While Mrs. Capron owned
and managed the Monroe, it
was a very prosperous and
Well known establishment—in
more ways than one. One stu-
dent who worked there as a
waiter in 19136 and 1901 was
James Norman Hail, the write
er and coauthor of Mutiny on
the Bounty. In his autobiogra-
phy, My Island Home, Hall
devotes a chapter to the Hotel

and his experiences there. He
describes Mrs. Capron as be-
ing “around sixtyriive at this
time . . . Her face had the
color or old parchment and
was so crisscrossed with fine
wrinkles as to be quite ex-
pressionless: but her eyes
were as blue and cold as p0<
lat ice, and her smile had all
the warmth of late aileritoon
sunlight in Siberian snow in
the dead of winter."

“A Howdy House"

Mrs. Capron’s ownership and
management or the Hotel
must have been a very excit-
ing and interesting period
both for the Hotel and {or the
town. In his autobiography,
Hall relates that the regular
dining room stair consisted of
girls ranging in age from the
middle twenties to the early

Unknown Gunner
Shoots at Town,

An unidentified person driv-
ing through town early Sun-
day morning tired a shotgun
into the room of Gregory Hill,
a sophomore living in West
Norris Hall.

Hill let: his lamp on when
he went to sleep and was a.
wakened at about 5:00 Sunday
morning to iind his wrist cut

Hill had left open the por-
tion of his curtain beside his
desk, and that part at the
picture window was full of
small holes. Further investi-
gation revealed nearly a hun-
dred holes in that and adja‘

covered with glass splinters
and shotgun pellets, Three or

Sch neirov Leaves

Dormitory Room

This Monday, Richard SchneL
Iov vacated his room in Loose
Hall. This action complied with
the decision of President Leg-
gett on the Schneimv visitation
case.

In an interview, Schneirov
stated that he lives for the good
or society. He claims he would,
as a humanitarian, give his his
to the cause—the "great revolu-
tion." He was not. however,
willing to face possible expul-
sion ior reiusing to vacate his
room as ordered because, he
said, he felt it was not worth
fighting over. He realized that
he was losing some or the sup-
port oi the students, and he
did not want to undo all the
work he had accomplished. he
stated that his main purpose in
publicizing his trial was to get
students interested in having
longer opens‘ hours. According
to Schneirov, it was he who
started all the excitement about
having more opens, and he ac-
tually had to convince Lee Mar-
ii at the idea as Maril was com-

SGA Plotn Wins;
Voting Heotvy

In the allrcampiis referendum
held Monday, the majority oi the
Gi-innell students voting iavoi-ed
determination oi coed visitation
hours on a hall basis, with no
restriction on the number or
hours allowed. Of the 781 votes
cast, 413 or 53% favored the tick
limit home rule proposal while
318 or 41% voted for hall selfa
determination within the limit:
oi twelve hours a day on week.
days and sixteen hours a day on
weekends. There were titty
votes, 6% oi the total, favoring
no change at all,

Now that the vote has been
taken, the proposal will go to
the iaculty Student Affairs come
mittee. where it carries no more
oiiicial weight than any other
proposal.

Tom Thomas, SGA President,
pleased with the results or the
voting, warned, however, that
the vote will be meaningless un-
less the student body acts upon
it immediately. “The vote in it-
self is worthless,” he said, "un«
less we set up hall judicial coun-
cils, determine hours, and take
upon ourselves the responsibility
of dealing with violators.”

Administration reaction is ex-
pected to hinge upon the an.
swers to two crucial questions.
First, can the students set up a
workable system of governing
themselves to replace the pre-
sent, unsatisiactory system es-
tablished by the administration?
Second, under the system, will
the students choose to havo
twenty-tour hour opens, and if
so, can and will the adminis-
tration, backed by the trustee:
and alumni, sanction such a sit-
uatiun?

King Scholarship
Wins Trustee Help

The Board of Trustees has

approved the allocation of
$10,000 irom the college’s ex-
isting scholarship endowment
to its new Martin Luther King.
Jr. Scholarship Fund, and the
board members have person-
ally pledged to match all giits
to the tund up to $10,000.

The Martin Luther King, Jr.
Scholarship Fund was initiat-
ed at a special convocation
held on October 18 during
Homecoming Weekend. The
endowed iund will provide fi~
nancial assistance for needy
Black students.

thirties. He wrote that he had
noticed that the staff of girls

always seemed to increase in
the weekends, but that he just
assumed they came to handle
the Increased number of traV<

eling men who came in over
the weekend. The girls were
indeed employed to handle the
extra travelling men, but not
only in the dining room. As
one of Hall’s fellow students
told him, “We are waiting
tables in a bawdy house." At
that lime, the hotel had a
widespread reputation (ex-
cept, ironically, in the town
and at the college), and trav-
elling men would make a paint
to be In GIlnnell [or the Week-
end. Mrs. Capron had these
girls do everything including
waiting on tables and scrub-
bing ﬂoors in addition to their
nighttime duties, reportedly
she paid them no salary at
all.
Slingy on Food

From 1898 to I912, the year
of her death, Mrs. Capron was
the Hotel. A very shrewd per-
son, Mrs. Capron would close
ly calculate the amount or
food that she would need
for the dining room each day.
.Often, the dining room would
run out of food, and in these
cases, the remnants of loud
lelt on the dishes oi other cus-
tomers would be served again.
'A point was made or giving
the reserved mod to traveling
men rather than to college

and townspeople. Undoubted-
ly, it must have been some-
thing to see Mrs. copron eve-
nings at the Hotel, covered
with diamond jewelry, smiling,
in Hall’s Words, “as she
turned the crank of the cash
Iegisler."

Alter Mrs. Capron's death
in 1912, her daughter and sons
in—iaw took over the manage
ment or the hotel. The daugh-
ter’s husband, Mr. Gillord,
was quite a ﬂamboyant char
acter and was well known as
a gambler. He had previously
owned and operated a saloon
at Marshalltown, and was tu-
mored to have killed a man
out Westr After the Giffords
died in the lﬂle 1920’: or early
1930’s, the College bought the
hotel and operated it until the
1940’s. During most of the
time oi the College’s owner-
ship, the hotel was operated
by Mrr George l-llser, h sun~
ln»law DI the Giilords, and
now the husband of Associate
Protessor Mrs. Velma Hisel‘.
In the 1940‘s the College sold
the hotel to Mr, Hlser, and he
owned it until 1959.

Josiah E. Grinnell, when he
iounded the town in the 1850’s,
made a stipulation on every
piece or property in town;
that it liquor were ever sold
on a piece of property, that
property would revert back to
Grinneil college, or his estate.
When the college bought the
hotel, they had that stipula-
tion removed from the hotel,
and thus irom all other land
in Grinnell.

Two Schisgal Plays, ”Horsefeoihers”

By FREDA TEPFER

Once again, friends, it’s time for your misinformed and down-
trodden campus events reporter to endeavor to instill a sense or
appreciation in your minds ior the misunderstood and downtrodden
efforts of Lhe members oi the Social Coordinating Committee.
Although not all the exciting events on this campus are arranged
by these hardworking people, we have them to thank for some of
the best of the scheduled events. (We have only ourselves to thank
for the unscheduled ones.)

On Friday, November 15. and Saturday the 16th at 8:00 in
Roberts Theater, the Kimbrauglis, aclurSrlnrraSldetlce, will appear

The Visitation Question

On October 28, some of the fac-
ulty released a letter to the students
asking for a rededication to educa-
tion, warning that the only hope for
mankind lay in knowledge and the
ability to act upon knowledge. The
students have responded by numer-
ous declarations of “home rule,"
-"floor rule,” and, in some cases, decla-
rations of “room rule." The student
government has responded by push-
ing a proposal which asks the mem-
bers of each hall to devote much time
to establishing rules on visitations un-
til the Student Affairs Committee can
make some official recommendations
to the President of the College.

Grinnell students have not before
shown so great an activism in any-
thing as they do now on the problems
of Visitation. Could it be that students,
completely uninterested in a national
election in which all the candidates
seemed uninspiring, and uninterested
in the diverse problems of the world,
have concentrated all their attention
on the issue of open dorms? Or could
it be that open dorms is the only ques-
tion that seems to have the relevance
necessary to stir undergraduates to
action?

The complexities of the open
dorms issue never cease to fascinate
students—what must be done with the
bathrooms, should girls be allowed‘
to take showers in a boys’ dormitory,
,what must be done to preserve mod:
esty (though one would think, it
seems, that this insistence on mod-
esty which has led several floors to
restrict bathroom visitations from
members of the opposite sex between
the hours of seven and ten in the
morning is nothing but a Neanderthal
bourgeois inhibition), and if the third
floor declares open visitations, but the
second floor does not, does someone
commit an offense by travelling from
the second floor to the third. The
limitless intricacies boggle the mind.

The zeal of students in pursuing
increased sexual freedom does not re-
flect a noble liberalism and interest
in the rights of men. It reflects, rath-
er, the selfish wish to ”be able to do
what I want," despite the implica-
tions and consequences of such ac-
tions.

The faculty letter discussed the
“bleak prospects” of undergraduates.

gettul of the problems of the world?
The excess idealism that youth is ac-
cused of possessing seems to be defici-
ent in Grinnell students Indeed, they
would seem to be lacking in it.
There is a wretched world to educate,
to serve, to save. But the children
here continuously squawk about the
necessity for sharing bedrooms. Sadly,
many students have shown their first
real enthusiasm in discussing the in-
tricacies of open dorms; this “expense
of spirit in a waste of shame" does not
seem likely to end soon.

Library Fines

The library exists for the benefit
of the academic community. It is not
a profit-making organization, and it
should certainly not work to impov-
erish students. Nevertheless, the li-
brary's merciless sytem of fines often
assists in the financial collapse of the
college’s best-mannered students.

The college fines is student a cer-
tain sum for books which are returned
past the “due" date, and a certain
much larger amount for overdue
records. The student, in the zealous-
ness with which he pursues his
studies, sometimes, and quite excus-
ably, forgets to return a book. When
the hapless fellow has received a no-
tice from the librarians informing
him that the item is overdue, the stu-
dent usually returns it with all pos-
sible speed.

To fine someone for forgetful-
ness of this sort is unjust. The library
ought to, establish s grace period of

' three days when a student is free from

fines, during which time a notice will
be sent to him informing him that his
book is overdue. Such a policy will be
equitable and will help to ease the fi-
nancial woes of students.

New Pencil Sharpeners

There has recently been a change
for the better in ARH which is espe-
cially worthy of mention. Several
pencil sharpeners have been placed
on every floor of the building. The
sharpeners ought to be an aid in stu-
dents’ education.

The college should continue in
this installation of needed devices by
placing additional bicycle racks out-
side ARH and the dining halls.

Letters to the Editor

Teacher Termination
Eiicits Protests

To the Editor:

"But the main business of A
college is holding classes, main-
taining faculties to teach them,
and encouraging students who
can profit from them.” October
28, mos—Statement from some
of the faculty

We wish to express our deep
concern regarding termination
of the teaching contract of Shel‘
don D, Parzen. It has come to
our attention that the primary
reason for this action was the
noncompletion of his doctoral
thesis. We feel that a decision
made on this basis overlooks his
teaching competence and other
related qualities.

Ar upperclasl majors who
have had prolonged Contact with
Mr. Parson through course work
and independent study, we feel
qualified to attest lo his capa-
bilities as an instructor. His
clarity of presentation and com-
mand of classic and contem
porary material combined wlih
his unique ability to communi-
cate makes him I most inspir-
ing teacher. The sire of his
classes and the variety of ma-
jors present serve to corroborate
his inspiring abilities. He ll
ever willing to conduct supplc~
mentary classes or inleldually
tutor students in order to clari-
fy material. This sensitivity to-
ward students is further mani-
fested in his rule as an adviser.
Such desire to extend himself
beyond the classroom realm has
resulted in a balance of rapport
and respect rarely found be-
tween teacher and student.

We find it disturbing that such
exemplary qualities should be
overlooked in preference to a
doctoral degree; it is our hope
that teaching excellence be giv-
en pn‘oriiy. We regard our in-
volvement as an integral pun
in questions of employment of
instnlctors, for ultimately it is
our education which is at stalls.
Professors of Mr. Panen‘s call-
ber are all too few at Grinnell
And their passing presents a
time of both regret and reflec-
tion—regret on the part of
students, and hopefully, reflec-
tion on the part of the iaculiy
who have made this decision.

Apology to Kent

To the Editor:

it was good to see Mr. Kent
in hls‘l‘eply to my letter, mnleu
——however disingenuouslyAthat
he “shudders" at the spectacle
of the irrational forces which h.
helped to unleash. There are,
however. I few chinks in the al-

of the great books, which enabl‘

fitting one of the major types or

case, that type is the Machxcvel.
lian hero, that is, the man who
would rather seem good than be
good.

I should like to offer a direct
apology. to Mr, Kent for taking
him to be [he lnstigator of fill
petitions—hut because of the
conflicting testimony he has
offered, in his letter and at th!
mass rally held the night of the

of the petitions and did not

tions were circulated on Tues-
day evening and the mass
rally on Wednesday, when
the President of the College was
out of town and had to read
About the demonstration in the
papers. So much ior Mr. Kent‘s
claim to prefer “the politics of
conciliation and compromise"—
thnugh I have even more dam-
aging evidence to offer on that
point a little latter.

Mr. Kent admits the petitions
were circulated by (his own
words) “well»wisl-lers and partl-
cipants" (boldface mine). At
the mass rally he inflamed and
excited a crowd already over-
wrought by one of the most sen-
national and complex cases of
Illegal visitation ever to occur
on the campus. His purpose was
to incite, as he admitted to me
after the meeting. Furthermore,
as he admitted publicly (sea
Scarlet and Black, Nov. 25, 1966,
p. 4: the article was written by
Hamid Fuson, the editor and
one of the‘ planners of the
"sleep-in”), he had made his
demonstration represent every
other issue currently agitating
his administration. The result
was that students could not sup-
port one cause without support-
ing all the others, whether rele-
vant or not. His conduct was as
gross an example of the legisla-
tive device known as the "rider"
As I have ever seen.

Alter that mass rally, I sought
out Mr. Kent; and because I
had observed his revealing eva~
liveness at the meeting, I was
most careful to bring a witness.
When I asked Mr. Kent why he
could not have waited R mere
two days, until the President re-
turned, Mr. Kent replied, “I
know if we waited till Friday
we couldn't whip up student sup-
port."

Mr. Kent accuses me of
“character assassination," But
one cannot assassinate what
had already committed suicide.

The reader may observe that
Mr. Kent laments his fate in
words chosen from a speech
delivered by Mark Anthony, 3
classic example of the dema-
gogue, who was defending a
wouldvbe dictator. in the light of
all this, the reader may also de~
cide how much Mr. Kent‘s pro-
testations of innocence are
worth.

No Cheers for ‘America Hurrah’ I

lly ELEONDRE SPIEGEL

It would have taken a better
observer than the average
playgoer — and such am I —-
to detect flaws in the acting
of America Hurrah; and since
much of the acting was delib-

erately exaggerated and uns‘

real, anyone would be hard put
to determine when the actors
fulfilled their intentions and
when they failed, At any rate,
it was the theme which aroused
most student comment. But
like the student senate, l do
not consider myself It vehicle
for student opinion; and so,
though 1 heard many different
opinions, I will express my
Own.

The first scene, or act, or

whatever such an absence of
form may be called, seemed to
Show the individual pitted
against “the system.” The four
people trying to get jobs rub-

mit to interviewers with plastic ,

faces and answer trivial or ar-
bitrary questions. Their despots
ate need for work and their hu-
man plight are ignored. Simi-
larly in the other scenes, we
see people who are inditrcrent
to someone in need, and cus-
toms whichrfoster such indif-
ference. Surrounded by these
impersonal institutions and un-
caring masses of men, the in~
dividual feels lost and alone.
Curiously enough, however, the
individuals who are suffering
no unjustly seem to feel no ans
ger, but rather guilt and fear.
Those of you who find that
point puzzling will have to spec-
ulate about it by yourselvesi
the play gives no answers,

As the first scene seems to
show what the society does to
make the individual unhappy,
so the second scene seems to
Show what the individual does
to make himself unhappy. The
three main characters are
bound to their TV -—~ that is
perhaps even their job — and
their petty desires. Only their
selfishness seems unbounded;
lot this they tell lies, use each
other, and almost let one of
their number choke to death.
Never do they think to question
the meaning of their lives or

the importance of their actions.
In them the vices of the so-
ciety, present in the first scene,
are portrayed in miniature.
No matter how much some of
the audience may have liked
the third scene, few would be
naive enough to think that it
did not offend, revolt, or shock
many of the people who saw it.
if the play was not meant for
such people, why weren’t they
warned or it, so they could boy-
cott it — surely a legitimate
procedure — and avoid being
hurt? i saw no posters saying
that the play was, quite liter-
ally, pornographic, and a dull,
lacklustre pornography at that.
Was the play, then, intended to
shock people? Whether that
was its intention or not, that
was its result. What become:
of the play’s protest against
human indifference to human
suffering, if the play itself, by
malice or thoughtlessness, pro-
duces suffering in others?

One might argue that stirrer-
ing is not bad in itself, that the
play communicates something
Valuable at the cost of suffer-
ing. But, unless falsehood can
be taught, the third scene adds
nothing to the message in the
rest of the play. Only a man de-
humanized by something worse
t h a n impersonal institutions
could think that such violence,
crime, and bestiality could ex-
ist in some corner of the uni-
verse where they might go un~
punished. Letting the charac-
ters tear apart the old lady
and the room she represents
and then leave the stage,
themselves unharmed and rm.
changed, exhibits a false view
of the universe, Yet even if
there is some message in this
scene, how many of those who
were shocked by it understood
it? The author foists his opin-
ions on an unsuspecting audi-
ence in such e way that he
leaves many people confused
and offended, indicating that he
doesn't care about other
people’s feelings or about suc-
cessfully communicating his
ideas — in short, that he him-
reli is a plastic person ortho
type portrayed in the first
scene. ‘ ‘ ’ -'

Nous
Where the Truth Lies . . .

lly DONALD STUMP

This year’s first issue of Nous came out Wednesday, and I
might be described as a kind of decorous hodgepodge, an int-
terdisciplinary tray oi aesthetic horssd'oenvres. Inside the simple
and beautiful cover are electronmicrographs, photographs, draw»
ings, poems, literary sketches, journal entries, is monogram, a
verbal puzzle, and a brandrnew Restoration catch, complete wifii
musical score.

Unfortunately I do not have the capacity in this column in
sample all the delights on the tray, so i will limit my oommentl
to the literary contributions. 0n the whole they show more noel
craftsmanship than i remember seeing in most of the issues at
former years. Present in many of the works were two virtue:
which have been, I think, more rare in the past: the attention
given to details of structure in the poetry and the use of well
considered imagery.

It has been the practice in much recent student poetry to d.
stray the integrity of the individual line, either by spiatterln‘
words out on the page I ll Ferlinghettl'ii “Coney Island of the
Mind No, ii," or else by writing what is essentially prose and
dividing it somewhat arbitrarily into run-on fines. About half o!
the poems in this issue of Nous still follow one or the other of
these two techniques, which are competently represented in Rob-
in Chambers' poem “i stand in the timelocked shadows" and
Sean McCormally's “Throughout the Day." But the other half
of Nous‘ content of poetry is written in more conventional linen
ones divided from each other to form grammatical or conceptual
units. For example, Lynn Adams' poem “Anna" begins,

A lady that I know about

Stands on a black rafiroad platform
Holding the rails of a toy train ——

The sections bumhed like a bouquet

In her milk—clean hand. (Whisper) . . .

It is good to see some thought in the division of poetic lines“
there is a delight in seeing a poet work skillfully within the limb
tations of a form, if for no other reason than it takes a great"
cleverness than unbridled methods of expression.

A second sign of the craftsmanship in some of the poetry
is the use of the structure to call attention to key words. I am
thinking particularly of Brian Harrls’ poem “(for Robert Low-
ell)" in which certain words are marked by their isolation in 1
line by themselves. For example, Lowell‘s imagined comment on
the relation between form and content is written,

I hate to see it when they do not
Grapple

I-le

Answered

The same technique of gaining intellectual punch by isolating
words or phrases in used effectively in Lynn Adams' poem “Sam.
one here is steadily breathlng," in Charles R. Burnl' work
“Imagine, it you will, a vision," and in several others. The ult-
til-nuts use of the technique is the monogram of the ultimau
name, God, which is given an entire page of the magazine. ’

On the' matter of imagery in Nous, r was impressed by the
number of magical moments in which the image served the work
as n whole at the same time that it called attention to itselfa
Take for example a phrase which graces Kit lcder's sometime;
prosaic and awkward “Diary":

. . . I have not felt so close to the raw skin of
poverty as i do today.

Or consider Molly Wolf's words
"Sheepdogs":

Now close, two streaks of duh and warm»white fur

sleeked to the earth and swift as storms, they chase
invisible sheep, birds, sun and one another . . .

it is unfortunately true that not all of the imagery is so har-
monious and well chosen. Some of it is impressionistic, like the
baroque chair which has a vague and tleeting role in John Gard-
ner‘s cryptic sketch called "The Change is Not New." Other
poems err on the side at swarnping the reader with too many
images and thus detract from the pleasure any one of them might
have produced alone. Molly Wolf’s “Storm" suffers from thil
mistake. Still other works use wildly imaginative metaphors that
are out of proportion to the thing being described and hence be-
come ridiculous. i fear that Charles R. Burns' interesting syn-
aesthetic “Vision” which is “rung" throughout the universe il
a bit too extravagant to express grief at separation from a lover.
It might be more poetic, and politic, to miss her less.

Although Nous contains the fruits of inexperience and hal
the inevitable roughness ot a hometown literary review, there
is workmanship apparent in almost all the works and none of
them were without virtues. The magazine is good enough to stand

in her delightful poem

on its own merits, not simply on the fact-that it was put out by »
ifriendi andpeerl. ’ -_, ’ . ‘- > ~

SCARLET AND BLACK

 

Bressler Termed ‘Good Interpreter’

By MELISSA HAYS

Friday evening, a versatile
artist, Charles Bressler, gave
a concert in which he proved
to be equally at home with
baroque oratorio, German
lieder, and English talk song.

He began the concert with
two songs by Purcellt He gave
an energetic rendition of the
first, and sang the second in a
more subdued tone.

The liumber tllat deserved
and received the most enthus-

iastio applause

was an aria from

Handel's oratorio,

Jephtha. The rec.
items was tragio and powerful,
and Bressler handled beauti-
fully the abrupt change to
the tender mood oi the
aria. He exercised perfect
control over the long, rising
lines, suggesting the ascent to
heaven. A second aria by Han-
del was jubilant and bold,
calling for a iullness of voice
that Bressier did not have.
But he sang smoothly the long
li lies with diiiicuit leaps,
showing again his good con-
lt'nl.

Of the three Debussy songs,
Bressler‘s performance of the
last, ”Chevaux de Ellis," was
most noteworthy. Underlying
the superﬁcial festivity or this
piece is an ominous tone
which is created by the dark,
chromatic passages lor the pi-
ano and is taken up by tho
frenzied song about the cease-
less turning of a carousel.

If the Handel aria was the
best periornred single selec-
tion, the five Schubert lleder
were the best group on the
program There was much va-
riety, some of the songs being
playful and capricious. others
being serene and lyrical. The
serenade could easily have be-
come saccharine, but Bressler
'avoided this pitfall. In the

tranquil, melodious sections of
the piece Where a poorer vo<
calist might have been exces<
sively sentimental, Bressler
sang with a simplicity that
was far more attentive, I think
a word in praise of the dc-
cumpanist, David Garvey, is
appropriate here, i had we
pected the pianist to shine in
the Debussy pieces, and he
did, in fact, play them sensh
tively. But it was in the Schu-
bert that he was most remark-
able, i-lo achieved a periect

balance with the soloist and
played with vitality a potenti-
ally monotonous accompani-
ment.

or the three folk songs ar-
ranged by Benjamin Britten,
“Sweet Polly Oliver" was this
most difficult, but Bressler
pcriprmed it with apparent
ease, This piece was polytonal
—that is, while the soloist was
in one key, the accompanist
was in another. The resulting
problems are obvious, but
Brassler‘s intonation was ac-
curate throughput the song,

Last on the program were
two songs by Samuel Barber.
The first was quiet and peace-
ful; the second was sometimes
tumultuous and fiery, some-
times mysterious and super
natural. As usual, Bressler
made the changes suggested
by the text without over—ems
phasis,

In all the songs he per-
formed, Bressler's articula<
lion, intonation, attention to
text and sensitivity in dynam-
ice are to be praised. I
heard several complaints that
the tenor did not have enough
power to shake the walls. I
feel that what he lacked in
volume, he made up for in
control and agility. It seems
to me no more taxing to belt
out a song than to sing quietly
in the sustained, emotionally
charged manner that Bressler
has mastered,

BRIDGE:
POST MORTEM

By JOHN GORDLEY

The unusual nurtrump over<
call is used primarily as a de-
fensive bid to prevent or dis-
rupt an enemy contract. It is
traditionally made by a player
holding at least ten cards in
clubs and diamonds, although
it can be used, under special
circumstances, for any two
suits. There are four, and only
four situations in which a no
trump bid can be considered
"unusual”:

l) a direct no-trump overcall
by a passed hand. For ex-
ample, in the auction: Pass -
l Spade - Pass - 2 Hearts . 2
NT. The last bid indicates
length in clubs and diamonds.

2) a jump overcall to two
no-trump: Pass < l Spade - 2
NT.

3) a nit-trump overcall over
an opposing no-trump bid: Pass
- 1 NT - 2 NT.

4) a no-trump overcall after
obvious enemy game and slam<
indicating bids: 2 Clubs - Pas]
- 2 Hearts . Pass - 2 Spades -
3 NT.

The unusual no~trump should
never ba bid in any but these
situations or it may be inter.
preted as indicating a strong
hand with even distribution, an
error which results in the most
ludicrous of Contracts.

There is no point requirement
to make an unusual no-trump
overcall. Generally, the strong-
er the distribution, the fewer
the number oi high card points
that are needed. With a strong
hand and “unusual" distribu<
tion, It is better to overcall in
a suit, intending to bid the
other it possible. An exception
to this rule would require an
extremely unbalanced strong
hand (6-6-1-0) in which, after
an unusual no-trump bid, part-

Student Government Speaks

By HEATHER FOOTE,
TOM THOMAS, LEE MARI].

Yes, this week student gov-
ernment actually does have
something to sayl However,
part of what we would like to
lay belore our “reading public”
relates to the nature of this col-
umn and its lack ot proton-
dities, past, present and lulurel

As an initial note at explanae
tinn, we would like to point out
the fact that what appears he-
tore you on Friday is written
on Tuesday in order to meet
Mrs Ariett’s deadlines. Those
or you readers acquainted with
the working conditions or Grim
nell student government will
appreciate the t‘liificulties of
Such a situation. Let us take
this week as a case in point.

in view or the existing con-
troversies on campus, one
might well expect this space to
be filled with insightful com-
ment on the opens situation and
the etiects ot Monday‘s refer-
endum and subsequent re-
sponses. However, as this is be-
ing typed, we are looking for-
ward to a campus meeting on
Wednesday, a meeting with Dr.
Leggett and beans Thompson
and Law on the same day, a
student alfairs committee meet-
ing on Thursday, and a possible
statement by the President on
Friday. Anticipating the prob-
able results of these “happen-
ings" approaches the impos-
sible. Hence, a complete corn.
mentary on the state oi altairs
would seem ludicrous.

Therefore, our potentials are
restricted to those things or
which we can be reasonably
certain, which at this point is
very little, or notes or a gen.
eral nature. And, given the
marked propensity or the en-

tire community for generalities,
we generally (ahahl) choose to

limit such wisdom.
o e >’

One thing or which we are
reasonably certain is that, bar.
ring significant disaster, two
openings will appear on the ju-
dicial councils These openings
are inr one year terms begin-
ning December 1. For informa-
tion about the judicial council
contact Larry Frank, chairman
(or possibly Richard Schnier-
ov?). Applications should be
sent to either Torn Thomas or
Tom Triplett by Wednesday,
November 27.

Pioneers lose to [09 Injured Harriers

34-28 A: Season Ends

By REGGIE GRAHAM

with six minutes left in last
Saturday's game, the score was
tied, 2&28. The whole game had
been very close, as the lead
changed hands seven times. A
bad play by our defensive back-
field, and a nice catch by Coa
junior letterman Mike Harris
(total receptions: 8 for 166
yards!) was good for 3s yards,
setting up the final touchdown.
Our last. slender hopes were
snuffed when, with 55 seconds
left, Gary Johnson’s 34 yard
pass was intercepted on the Coo
eight yard line.

Coe had a tough team this
year. They downed St. Olaf, Cor-
hell, and Knox and stayed ahead
of conference winner Ripon until
the last two minutes of that

ame. Both the} Pioneers and the
ohawks had identical 34 sea-
son records, going into the
game. The statistics of the Grin.
neii-Coe game show the equality
Hi the two teams. While they
were able to gain almost twice
as many yards passing, 183
yards to our 93, we were able to
gain a net of 165 yards on the
ground to their 137. We also
made 21 first downs; they, only
thirteen,

The second half began with
a Cos 62-yard touchdown drive,
followed by a Grinnell 62-yard
touchdown drive, Coe bounced
back 64 yards to scorex
not to be outdone, the Pioneers
took the ball on their 36 and
drove 64 yards to score, and
move ahead 2&2], During the
first 19 minutes of the second
half, both teams had the ball
twice, and each scored twice.
The Kohawks knotted the score
at ZE-all and ﬁnally rallied to
win on a 3 yard run by Gerstner.

The pioneer offense played an
excellent game, amassing 258
yards—165 rushing and 93 pass-
ing. Three regular offensive lined
men were out with injuries. Ra-
piacements Ralph Clayman,
Roger Roe, and Ernie Rose were
able to fill. the gaps quite well
though. Jim Edwards and Jack
Buel, who complete the middle
line, ﬁnished up very successful
seasons.

in the backfield. the team's
most valuable back, .ion Bus<
well, totaled 73 yards in 23
carries and one touchdown. The
touchdown gave Jon a total of
36 points for the season, making
him ninth among scorers in the

MCAC. Brian Barnes rushed 71
yards in 2o carries. Brian played
an excellent game, outrunnlng
and eluding the entire Cos de<
tense to score on a 64 yard punt
return. Roy Lewis threw a key
block which helped Brian get
started. Torn Lower had a great
day, averaging 7 yards per
carry for 21 yards.

John Winterson, one of the
finest ends to come out of Grin-
nell in a long time, finished out
his football career well, catch-
ing three passes for a total of 42
yards, one touchdown, and one
two-point conversion, John fin-
ished eleventh in conference
with 30 points.

Rick Vranek and Doll Kraitsik
both played well. Each inter-
cepted one pass on defense.

"Our team has improved
steadily since the first practice”
Coach Bowers said. This was to
be expected with so many in-
experienced yet capable sopho-
mores. Racked with injuries as
we were, however, the trend
could have easily reversed it«
self. Determination and spirit
were able to overcome this
tendency and we were able to
.iinish up with a “good season."
Coach Bowers says that he goel
away from this season with a
feeling of "enthusiasm,” with
the knowledge that the win-loss
record doesn’t tell the whole
story, and with the hope for an
even better year coming up.

The fact that all three of
next year‘s captains, Jim Ed-
wards, Larry Grimm, and Gary
Johnson, are sophomores is
some indication as to where our
strength will lie, and the addi-
tien of this year’s undefeated
prep team could mean those
hopes might be more than ”pips
dreams,"

SDS Confronts ROTC
In Football, Wins 7-6

Monday at 4:15, ROTC
and arch-enemy sos got to
gether long enough to play
a football game. After 15
minutes of play, ROTC
made the first touchdown for
six points. Immediately aft-
erwards, Brian Barnes of
the SDS team charged so
yards for a touchdown. His
extra point broke the tie,
making the score SDS 7.
ROTC 8. The game ended
without additional scoring.

Rooters for SDS. led by
cheerleaders, seemed to out~
number ROTC supporters.
But in spite of the political
differences of the players
and spectators, the atmos-
pher of the game was
friendly.

End Grim Season

By vvon sroaxuax
(Sports Editor)

The Pioneer harriers wrapped
up their 1968 season last Satur-
day in Chicago. The Grinnell
seven, slumped by injuries,
wound up a miserable eighth
out of the nine teams which
competed in the Midwest Con-
ferenca meet.

The league crown was caps
tured by St, Olaf With 42 points.
Carleton, who had won the title
seven years running, finished
second with 46 points. Coo
claimed third place (87); Mon-
mouth, fonrth (133); and Cox‘-
neil, fifth (138).

Mike Steiner, a senior at Cain
leton from Minneionka, Minns<
sofa, finished first individually.
This was Steiner's third Cori.
secutiva first place conference
finish. He, along with {our
other runners, broke the pre-
vious conference record of
20:41.3 Set in 1965 by Belolt'l

.Mlke Hartman. Steiner's rec.

ord setting performance on tho
d-mila course was 19:53.

The Grinnell story this fall
has been injuries. While they
began the season with much
promise, winning two of their
first four duals, and showed
much improvement with every
meet, injuries struck and hobs
bled the team. Four of the
seven varsity runners carried
leg injuries into the confer-
ence meet.

Eric John, a soph from Lo~
gansport, Indiana. led the team
all season. His best four mile
effort was 21:39. John Russell
(soph) and John Asbille (jun-
ior) ran well most of the sea-
son. Their best times were 22:]!
and 12:27 respectively. Round-
lng out the team were Tim
Power, soph (22.55); Bruce
Lueke, senior (23:50); John
Siekett, junior (23:50); and Bob
Dorsett, soph (24 0). it wal
Bob's first year out.

The outlook for next year ll
very exciting. Losing only one
letterman and anticipating I
healthy team, the Pioneers
could shape up as a real chal-
lenge to perennial conference
powerhouses. The fresh have
exceptional potential and should
add much needed depth to the
varsity squad.

Chuck McGrath, from Eel-
wood, Illinois, led the Trash to
a ﬁrst place finish in the
Southern Conference meet; a
Victory in their meet with the
University of Northem iowa _.
their only dual; a third place
finish in the Gl'innell Fresh«
man Invitational (6 teams)”
and third in the conference.

“He was our lead runner,"
commented Coach Obermiller,
"and potentially one of the best
distance men in Grinnell his<
wry." Chuck broke the pre-
vious freshman 3-mila record
of 16:17 with a fun of 15:09, He
topped the old f-mile mark
(22:34) in 20:39.

Phil Morales of Milwaukee
was generally the second man
on the team. His best effom
this season were 16:07 (El-mile)
and 22:05 (4-mile). Oscar Rat-
tenborg (16:44), Mark Nissan
(17: 10), Mike Daley (17:37) and
John Weins (17:47) rounded 00‘
the seven starters.

GRAY MATTER

By BILL GRAY

it is said that absence makes the heart grow Yonder, so, con-
lequently, since my column was noticably absent last week i
suppose everyone is eagerly awaiting its arrival. '

The most popular sport so far appears to be a new game
which is called musical opens. it is very similar to the game we
all played in kindergarten called musical chairs with the sole en-
ception being that musical chairs had rules. While I am, admitted-
ly, on the outside looking in, i think the object of the game is u:
have each floor in each hall determine its own rules for the game
in order to prove conclusively that people are different Such being
the case it is, of course, impossible to have any overall rules since
they would interfere with personal freedom . . . or something like
that. I obviously don't seem to have the hang of the game but
you can be sure i am making every effort to learn the rules, or
anti-rules as the case may be_ The most interesting outcome of
this new pastime came about when it was decided that each room
should have the final say in the question, A double was divided
into two rather extreme factions with one opting for 24-hour opens
and tile other for no opens. The ensuing discussion degenerated into
a street fight type of affair which, interestingly enough, also has

no rules.

Returning to the more familiar sports, Read captured LM1
swimming by a narrow margin over Dibble. or all the sports,
this one seems to have one of the smaller followings as evinced
by the fact that Dibble took second with a massive three-man

contingent.

I. M. volleyball is in full swing and, true to my predictiom
the games are characterized by enthusiasm, desire, and totally
wretched playing. At least it has the advantage of being a sport
where physical injuries are kept to a minimum unless, of course
you are rabid enough to become entangled in die net.

I hear that I. M. wrestling is in the offing again this year.
Mr_ Conney M. Kimbo has graciously consented to teach all those
interested some of the finer points of this most grueling of spam,
What is most necessary for the success of the sport is, however,
not training but paper bags. The winners can use them to deposit
their cookies in after the match and the 1. M. chairmen can usl
them to carry home losers in after their match.

Cindy’s Cinderellos Capture Trophy

By cmoy ROOT

At noon Saturday, two little
Grinneli cars. dwarfed by the
buses of the opposing teams
pulled into the Ames parking
lot, and a motley mob of min-
utemen piled out. Nobody paid

much attention. They should
have. Once on the field, the
shabby sweatpants and tat~
tered T—shlrts were forgotten
as the Grinnell girls’ hockey
team was transformed into a
finely tuned machine that
surpassed all other teams in
Iowa in finesse and stickwork.
(Are you sure you have no
RE. majors?)

Our first game against in.
we State saw the ball being
constantly bombarded at their
dismayed goalie, without an
overwhelming amount of suc-
cess, in other words—no
goals. Finally, in the last 3
minutes, Mimi broke the spell
and slammed one in—whewi

Our next rival, Drake Uni-
versity, offered no competition
and paved our way to Luther.
who was also still undefeated.
We fast remedied that, and
With the help of the defensive
cuts and passes, Mimi and
Cindy (who had been running
the ball down the field and

ADDRESS HEREI

whacking away at the goal all
day) easily put two in. Thll
third smear of the day earned
the Grinnell girls the right to
the finals—and boy! Were wl
fired! Here we met the iowa
Wesleyan Bruisers, who were
seething for revenge after,
their sound dunking of last
week. A little speed and
stickwork, left them far he-

.hind, and we easily scored I
2.0 victory. They are to be
commended, though, as the
only team who even got a shot
off during the four games-
and gave our poor starving
goalie Connie a chance to put
her stick on the ball.

The high points of the day
werei a goal by defenseman
Narda—who still can't believe
it: our hoi-tey . pokay dance
which completely obliterated
our opponents; and the huge
trophy which Mimi has been
mothering for the last three
days, undoubtedly getting it
ready for front and center
spot in our team picture. I‘d
say we looked ferocious
enough to scare away . . . I
mouse maybe, which just goes
to show in what's inside that
counts — or don't underestis
mate the Grinnell girlsl
