By HAROLD FUSON

Spirited discussion followed in
the wake of Tuesday's extra edi-
tion of the 5&3. Much of it was
initially conducted along the
lines “What are they trying to
do anyway?"

But as the week were on. it
became clear to most students
that the phrase a “questioning
of the whole community” meant
exactly what it said it did in
the eyes or the students who
initiated ii.

The Executive Cabinet
toured lounga Tuesday
through Thursday discussing
with groups or two or three
halls the ideas presented in
Tuesday’s extra. Tuesday

night‘s session with Loose,
North and South was typical,
it a little more spirited than
some of the discussions.

“More Than a Dance"

Airplane, Martin Team Movement
for Homecoming Music and Mood

“This year’s homecoming is going to be more than a
dance. It will be a theatrical as well as a unique dancing
experience,” says Boll Johnston, social coordinator. He

describes the audiovisual event
00 be staged on Oct. 22 as “we
ially unlike anything that’s ever
been here belore. it's a new
modern dance; a reflection of
today."

Tho'ambilious event will
bring to Darby gymnasium
Jellerson Airplane, a folk-
rock group, in combination
with the visual projections oi
Anthony Martin or the San
Francisco Iape center at Mills
College.

Movies, slides, and moving
color abstracts Will cover large
screens measuring 80 feet by
17 feet placed along the walls
of the gym, to create an exclt<
ing mood in tune Willi tlte mu-
sic. “We are attempling to cre-
ate an excitement of the mind,”
said Johnston, Marlin presented
some of his visual projections
here last spring at a showing in
Roberts Theater.

Johnston describes this addi.

. tion of visual eitects to llie mu-
sical aspects of a dance atmo-
sphere as “the latest develop~
mom in the pop music iield. Its
purpose is to stimulate in a way
more than just through lriuSIC."

“This will be an event spe-
ciﬁcally geared to the indi-
vidual," stressed Johnston.
“No and should feel that a
date is required to attend."
Ha cited the narrow appeal It

“couples only" as a weak-
ness at this traditional home
coming dance. “This is de-
olgned to appeal to more than
just dancers I hope that the
entire campus will take the
opportunity In see this event
at some time during lhe eve-
ningl"

Music and projections will be
constantly changing throughout
the evening. “We are not rely-
ing on crepe paper to provide
the mood," said Johnston, “but
rather see this inter-media
Combination as the stimulus of
a very alive, moving feeling."

Russian Drama Panel

Mchregor On
Rights Movement

By KRYS NEUMAN

Congressman Clark MacGre-
gor (Rep, Minnesota), in a
spirited coffee hour last Friday
on “The Civil Rights Movement
Today," maintained that the
white backlash killed the Civil
Rights Bill of 1966. He predict.
ed that there will be no open
occupancy legislation in the
coming year. MacGregor went
on to say, however, that he
thinks the reaction is just a
temporary “blackliick” in Con-
gress and that the “body politlo
is sympathetic” to the light for
civil rights.

Alan Jones (history), the oth-
er panel member, slated that

suggestions — hypotheses to im-
tiate serious discussions.”

Discussion then ranged wide-
ly over all aspects of campus
life: social, academic and per-
sonal.

in the area of women's hours,
much was said about what one
student called “repression by
the system" of the “potential
for responsibility.”

Some students, especially
girls, expressed doubts about
the wisdom ot completely
abolishing hours for freshman
women. As one girl said,
“Girls are not raised the
same way as bays," and need
some form oi guidance.

Karen Lauterbach. AWS
Board President, posed the
question, “Do girls consider
hours a legitimate form or
guidance?” Loud commotion
arose in reply. One girl on-
swered that “guidance should
not be punitive” but “should be
a constructive thing." Another
suggested that maybe "some
kind of initial freshman hours
might be a good thing.”

In the area of extending the
open dorms privilege, the only
real objection came from one
boy who said, “in have to buy
a bathrobe.”

lie was asked if he thought
this was an insoluble problem.
“No," was [he slouthearted re:
ply.

A number or students ques-
tioned the hours proposed for
open dorms" extension. Tho
hours proposed in Tuesday’s
5&3 were 11 arm. in 7 p.m.‘
Monday through Thursday; ll
nun. to 11 p.m. Friday and
Saturday; and 1 [Ln]. lo 1
porn. on Sunday. Many stu-
denls felt that 1 pm. to 0 pm.
might be a more reasonable

period of time on weekdays.
Support seemed unanimous
for some sort of extension of
open dorms to a daily basis.
however. .

In the academic area, I
large majority of hands were
raised when the question was
asked, “How many of yogi
would attend a voluntary lnle -
im session the last week or s
of Christmas vacation?" A go
deal of interest was also
aroused in the idea of holding
interdisciplinary seminars.

Several students expressed
the feeling that the general
lack of responsibility incul-
cated by the rule system led
to irresponsibiilty in the social
and academic areas as well.
As one girl said about the pres-
ent academic structure, thero
is a “general feeling of n lack
of responsibility to what yolf
are already commiited to do.’
Another said, “People are lesl
likely to initiate any kind ol
activity (under the preseni
structure)."

As the discussion closed, it
seemed certain that there was
a great deal yet to be said,
It seemed also that many, it
not most, of the ideas offered

Cowles Harvests Felzer Title

By ANDY ISAACS

Darby gym witnessed the tra-
dilicnal Fctzer Sing last Sun-
day night as six mixed choruses
presented their contributions for
publick applause (sic).

Cowles Hall retired the trophy,
having placed first for the lhird
year in a row. Cowles and
Haines presented “Iowa." “Rock
Island Line," “Country Corn
Flakes." and “Little Brown
Church in the Vale," for its
theme of “lows." Dressed as
farmers, the Cowles - l-laines
group was the only group to
write its own words to some of
the songs.

North Younker, having placed
second {or its third consecutive
year, retired its plaque. North
teamed up with James this year
to present “The Mind Speaks,
the Heart Sings," a Collection of
Negro spirituals.

With little doubt, Langan and
Loose deserved the booby prize
for their presentation, “Old Grin-
nell." IL was, by the way, Lan~
gan‘s first entrance since the
revival of the contest. Langan
and Loose offered rho Grinnell
Hymn (with appropriate ges-
lures), an ode to coeducation. a
low giggles, and a director who
was wearing a coat too large
for him. It soon became appar-
ent that the singers were rath-
er hazy about the words to their
songs, and the presentation grew

more amusing as it wore on. Thu
singers sac down to thundei'ou
applause.

Other hall pairs with tho
themes of their presentations
were South-Read. the South and

SCARLET AND BLACK

 

The censorship of “The Chairs" once again raised the sticky
problem oi censorship oi the arts, literature, and the press at Grin-
nell, While “The Chairs" incident is confusing, it did point out some
oi the serious problems we lace unless censorship is categorically

eliminated on this campus,

“The Chairs” is not an isolated incident of censorship or at-
tempted censorship here, and the son has knowledge of several
student projects that will appear this year which may be subject to
censorship under the current policy. We should not wait for the
issue to come up again, with the resultant contusion, hard feel-
ings, educational losses, and bad press coverage before we correct

the unsatisfactory situation.

There are many positive reasons for eliminating the concept of
absolute censorship, We will bring up some oi the most important

here:

The practice of censorship is poor educationally. The college
should not teach, by example or otherwise, that artistic or press
censorship is permissible merely because some people will become
upset. Last year President Leggett made a serious attempt to
have a student photographic exhibit containing nude pictures re-
moved on the grounds that “we are only trying to avoid trouble.”

The college should not teach that the proper way to handle con-
troversial issues is to "blot them out.” This attitude is very much
opposed to the liberal arts concept of education by exposure, dis-

cussion and learning

Obscenity in the arts and literature is a relevant issue in the
real world, Due to our upbringing, it is a diiiicult subject for many
people to talk about intellectually. Students want and need guid-
ance in this area, Resorting to censorship when something com
troversial occurs teaches nothing, and may easily have a negative
affect. We would point But that a coiiee hour discussion was held
alter the periormancs of “The Chairs” and that no one, not even
Meyer, said anything about the now controversial scene.

when the faculty seems unable to discuss such things in the
open, what are students to think? Students are given little help in
learning to think intellectually about controversial matters related
to obscenity when a faculty member is the first to yell "lewd and
gross." Due to the censorship, it will he difficult ior a student here
in ever see “The Chairs" with objectivity.

Openly discussing problems or obscenity would be worthwhile,

Student Theater

By
HELEN l.. KLEIN
HOWARD EARNED
MAXWELL HELFGO'IT

Our purpose here is not to discuss the specific
case of Dennis Rich and his production or “The
Chairs,” but rather to try to make some "valid
generalizations" about the responsibilities the
student director, his instructors, and the liberal
arts college administration have to the college
community and to one another, The peculiarities
and complexities of this particular case tend to
lead us astray and make us target that we are
dealing within a certain context — the college
community —— and with a spec' c population —-
the Students, iaculty, and administration 0! that,
college,

The student director is in a difﬁcult situation.
He is an artistic agent —— a representative of the
playwright — and has n responsib‘ 'ty to convey,
with “artistic integrity," the aims and goals at
the playwright us he (the director) sees them
to be. But he has another rule -— that of student.
As a student, and as a student who is earning
academic credits ior his work, his responsibilities
are not only to the playwright, but to his instruc-
tors and, more generally, to the learning expe-
rience. In this learning situation then he is not a
iree agent, nor should he be. The student produc-
tion in an art form, but the student is an appren-
tice to his art. Whether he is to call the instruc-
tions and comments he receives from his instruc-
tors “censorships” or “constructive criticism”
and how he is to react to such comment and in»
struction depends largely on his own attitude not
only toward the art to which he is apprenticed,
but to the learning process in which he is in-
volved,

His situation is further complicated by the re-
sponsibilities he owes to the college administra-
lion. His work is sponsored by the administration
oi the college both ﬁnancially and physically (in
terms of the space aiiorded the director ior his
production) In a less specific (but by no means
less important) sense, the student director be-
comes a part of the college administration when
he presents a production which is open to the pub
lie. The importance 0! "public relations” for the
Student is a much more difﬁcult matter to assess
than it is ior the Broadway dimcwr who must be
assured a favorable box office response in order
to present his production In the college situation
the student must be sensitive to the kind or audi-
ence to which his performance is geared'—- an ex-
tremely difficult and very important feeling to
establish.

The third responsibility is, then, to the college
community as a whole, not only to the audience
but to the sensibilities of the community and the
attitudes which prevail among the student body,
in the “outside world," and among the iaculty as
well. We grant that this kind at anticipation and
clairvoyance is a dilficult task for an expert, let
alone for an amateur. But we also feel that spe-
cial care must be taken in this area,

The aims at Grinnell as a liberal am institue
tiun hopefully are not solely geared ior the stu.
dents, or faculty, or administration, but ior all
three. This necessitates the establishment of a
true academic community in which all parties
are active, interested, and aware of the respon-
sibilities each has tor the others. The purpose oi
independent study is to allow the student to devel-
op his i-esponsniilities in a mature and thought.
iul way. It is up to the administration and the inc.
Lllty, as well as the student, to be aware of both
the problems and rewards of such a program
and to approach both in a responsible iashiun.

Cicero Spurned

To the Editor:

This college proudly main-
tains a great injustice to one or
the great shapers of intellectual
thought in Western civilization,
namely to Cicero. Around the
top oi the former library, Car»
negie llall, are the names or
those who led us to our pre-
sent state of intellectual de-
velopment. Noticeaiiiy absent
from these is the name,
"Cicero". This would not he so
had were there a proper substi-
tute, but the closest we get to
“Cicero" is “Caesar”, certainly
not a comparable shaper oi in—
tellents.

This, lhough, is only an i
inﬂict! in words, and ever

ody would agree that an in-
justice in deed is tar more
serious. The injustice in deed
is also present at Grinnell,
though in a for subtler way.
One of Cicero's finest beliefs
is that. meals should not occur
merely for the energizing or
the body. but that “convivium”
should be present in them. The
actual eating should be subordi-
nate to the pleasure of the
company.

In Grihnell the opposite
view is held, as is exemplified
by the strict, cold, harsh rule
that one who does not have
n ﬂoat hour class may not eat
with a friend who does. There
are, allegedly, reasons ior this,
but i believe the upholding or
the rinciple of convivium is
wort the minor alterations
necessary for it.

Grinnell ought not to inﬂict
such a hard punishment as it
does (as it did to me), a heavy
fine, to those who accept this

idea of Cicero. Rather should
Grinnell change this unholy
Policy.

Folly?
To the Editor:

1 have been reading the spe
cial issue 01 the sen devoted
to this year‘s encampment, in
which various “student leaders”
have expressed their stances,
hopes, and demands. The sen
quotes President Leggett as be»
ing ”ecstatic” over the encamp
ment; and if “ecstatic" be tak-
en literally, as meaning “beside
oneself", i too, am ecstatic #
though scarcely with joy. 1 have
not been so depressed since 1
graded my last batch of blue-
books.

All or the statements are
prime examples or bad logic
enshrined in worse grammar.
We have clearly failed, as an
educational institution, to
teach students how to think
clearly and correctly; unit,
worse, we have railed to teach
ihern even how to ask the

kt questions.

To detail the lollies of each
piece would take lsr too much
space: hence I am altering to
consult with any oi the authors
who might wish to, in order to
show the ﬂaws that mar each

argument — or rather utterance.
Such a course precludes, alas,
exposing the folly, but the sen
has already performed that ser»
vice merely by printing the

ResponSlbllliy
To the Editor:

Having lived on this campus
for over two years and having
seen and had personal experi-
ences with what i will call, ior
lack or a better term, nonre-
sponsiblluy on the part of so
many of my lellow students, I
find myselt in a state of super-
consciousness and elation at the
proposals resulting trom this
year’s encampment.

As a ireshman i expected to
lind college men and women
people who would be willing
and able to carry responsibility.
1 found instead a grotto ot peo-
ple who, lor the most part, were
able, but unwilling to be respon-
sible, Perhaps I ought to be
more speciﬁc about what 1 mean
by the term "responsibility." 1
mean sincerely interested in
events and things going on a
round them and not accepting
them passively; wanting to give
at themselves to help othrrs or
to do anything at all, but hav-
ing some drives other than just
seeking good times; being self-
reliant and not needing super-
imposed sign posts telling them
what to do and when to do it;
and generally being able to
conduct themselves in an adult
and mature manner.

I leel the proposals presents
ed by the executive cabinet, by
creating an atmosphere of
“ireedom” would lot-co students
to accept responsibilities which
they did not have to deal with
previously. And from this would
develop my higher concept oi
the “responsible student."

I don’t tool that 1 am being
too idealistic about this, judging
from the very positive reactions
of so many of the students and
the general aura of excitement
which is pervading the campus.
And this is not the excitement
of “on BOY! i No women’s
hoursl A iiltyeighl hour visitae

tion week!" It is the quiet e
citement of students who com<
prehend the reasons for these
changes and see the vast po-
tential which these proposals
have for making something
more of this campus than a
place to go to classes and live
find are caught up in a de-
sire to be at art of this in some
way, even i only sitting down
nnd talking it over with others
who are also caught up in this
“feeling.”

1 only hope that students who
feel this mood, as I feel it, will
not let it subside as the novelty
wears off but will sustain these
trends and carry them over to
other facets of campus life,
making Grinnell a more Vibrant,
alive, interested, and nesponsr-
his community.

Grade Escalation

To the Editor:

That the {acuity chose
not to bother the student
body with the_propo_sed 35
grade change indicates Just how
much the faculty regarded stilt
dent opinion on the matter.
That we now have a 3.5 grade
indicates the faculty’s reiusalto
examine realistically and anti-
cally the anachronism of grades.
It indicates a departure from
the progressive, partial pass-tail
system introduced publicly last
sprln . Perhaps by taking one
step stimuli, the faculty be-
lieves it can take two steps ior-
ward. But playing this kind of
calypso movement could well
clip the value 0‘ a Gl'lnnell ed-
unalion.

Another grade means not only
more emphasis on grades but,
lcr many students, simply ano-
ther grade to grub for. Now if
grades adequately reflected the
value the student obtained
from the course, then grades
could be justified. That they
don't, that they oiten encourage
supel ciality and competitive
innnity, hardly needs explana-
tion here, But what does need
explanation is why the iaculty
is practicing grade escalation.
Perhaps the faculty believes
that increasing the grade pres
sure Will iol'ce the student to
negotiate for knowledge, Un-
lortunately, the student may
just negotiate for more grades

— which might embarrass the
laculty. Why not, ior example,
a 3.25 grade, This would be the
diiference between “very good"
work and “Sllpel'lul‘”_work; we
could call it “percenuve” work.

. . . one can hope the taeulty
will reexamine its policy on
grades and invest the student
with a little more academic re-
sponsibility in hls junior and
senior years. Specifically, l oro~
nose:

1. That grades be retained for
freshmen and sophomore cours-
es, and tor upper level courses
outside orie’s major, _

2. That in junior and senior
courses within _ one’s major.
grades be abolished. instead,
the nroiessor shall submit an
explicated written evaluation of
the student's work in the course.
The evaluation would be sent to
graduate schools, which would
thus be able to evaluate not
only the student‘s work more
precisely but also the profes-
sor’s ability. Certainly, all this
involves more paperwork and a
burden on the professor. But
(a) the evaluation would . be
more precise than. a numerical
grade, and (b) it would en-
courage the progesspr to pay
more than a polite rnterestm
his suident as the latter begins
to concentrate in the tormer's
field. And perhaps the quality
of bout would improve.

3. That if this method of eval-
uation is too burdensome on tho
proressor, it would be conﬁned
to the senior year. That year,
after all, is the most important
in terms of the student's work
and the professor’s guidance.

There is nothing really rad-
ical or new in these tentauvo

roposals. Some kind of_ system
like this is both a practical and
logical way to evaluate a stur
dent’s education, especially for
a small college thnt prides ,rt—
sell in its unique virtue of size
and hears itselt called “one or
the most outstanding liberal arts
colleges” by The National 9h-
server. Some kind of discussion
—or “dialogue” to use an aca<
demic clich%alnng these lines
necessary. And some kind at
thinking — hard or solt or even
malloab e — by the faculty and
administration is necessary
Grinlieil is not a university and
thus does not have a {rat race.
But that does not preclude r
rat race—Don Winner

Aflack from the East

Boy Wonder Bliizes Des Moines;
Excitemenl,Speculaiion in Wake

By Don Winuey

Sen. Robert F. Kennedy barnstormed through Iowa
last weekend for Democratic candidates, giving Iowa
politics some excitement, some intelligence, and a fine

pair of white teeth. In Des
Moines. a throng of 3,500 greet-
ed him with all the hoopla and
mesmeric excitement that
greets any Beatle or presiden-
tial candidate, There were a lot
of young voters. a lot who were
just young. and a surprising
number of medicare maids,
those little old women without
tennis shoes who View Bobby
as a grandson par excellence.

Standing ovations were the
Itanding orders for the day,

Senator Kennedy

When Congressman Neil Smith
of Des MDines (Dem) an-
nounced, “I know of no one in
the Democratic party, in the
nation today, who can help lcwa
more this fall," everyone went
wild. Everyone, that is. except
a few who wondered if Smith
had forgotten about President
Johnson. But Democrats
weren’t going to discuss him,
not today.

Behind all the glamour and
commotion were lhe efforts of a
wealth—oiled machine, an East-
ern braintrust, and the political
dead body 0! Hubert Humphrey.
n is easy to dislike Kennedy on
those grounds. but one might as
well dislike American politics
and apple pie, His isn’t the ﬁrst
dynasty nor the first healthy po-
litical organization in American
politics. After all, what he
wants, or may want is what
Lyndon Johnson wanted when
he sat soaking his Tee! in the
muddy Pedernales. And who is
to say Mr. Johnson deserved
what he got, or that Mr. Ken—
nedy will get what he deserves?

When Kennedy speaks, his ac<
cent seems to link his words
with the past, the New Frontier,
and the rest of American his-
tory,
selves crowd the present into
the future. “i am not satisfied,"
he keeps saying in that iamiliar
staccato repetition, with the ta-
miliar forward thrust of his
right; hand. “i am not satis—
ﬁed." His speech is last and
stumbling, but the eiiect is that
same sense of urgency to grain
pie with Society’s problems his
older brother had. It is the sense
of lolal.involvement in the pres
ent, a pragmatism that in its
very immersion in the present

while the words them- 0

becomes the traditional theme
for any successtul political can-
didaie.

Kennedy has to mature before
any further ambitions are rea-
lized and he has the time to do
it in. He is a tresh political hope
—and an energetic unktor the
country. ObVlously, a lot can
happen before l972, and Ken-
nedy may not be able to main.
taln his momentum to keep it
rising. Many already see him
building a national political
base in Iowa and elsewhere this
tall, Many see him as a future
President and Kennedy himself
doesn't seem adverse to the
idea.

structured this year. Ninety per

Feizer Sickening
To the Editor:

Feller sing is n day old and
yet i still have a sick feeling
inside when i think of parts of
it. Without dramatics—I'm talk,
me about James and North and
their disgusting presentation.
The topic of Negro culture is
one about which lhe average
American while is grossly ignor-
ant. and Grinnellians seem to
be no exception. if these halls
were bold enough to choose
such a topic, you'd think they’d
choose it with the awareness
that its treatment would re
quire sensitivity, Am I the only
one nauseated‘!

“To pay tribute to the honor
and dignity oi a people.” since
when do we dress like Vaga-
bonds? Tear up your clothes
and look disreputable—Negroes
are like that. Negro spirituals
must be sung‘that way. Were
you trymg to Justify or amelio-
rate the horror of slavery by
pointing out that even under
such conditions beauty arose?
Don't insult our intelligence
so. And if you wanted to pre-
sent the beauty, why not dress
as you would dress to present
the beauty of any other digni
ﬂed people.

1 especially liked the way you
chose a White man’s song to
express Negro honor. Do you
really believe that a slave
could be happy to be owned
and ordered around and beaten
and spit on? it is n subtle but
pervasive prejudice that many
believes that a Negro would
say “nothings plenty for me."
or course, I don‘t want nothing,
you say, but Negroes are Ell-
iel‘ent.

And your dialect was nice too
—a cute little reminder that
illiteracy breeds poor grammar.
it was illegal to teach a slave
to read, remember?

You took second place —
your singing was good. Your
handling of the topic was often-
sive and what really makes

me sick is that you don’t even
know it,

“Tribute to honor and dignis
1y." “Land of the free and the
home of the brave." And you
really believe it.

that there are many people on

necessary, often dancers lack-

technique are chosen because
they do wen in improvisation-
al dances, Training is available
on campus, however, in the

Board to Sponsor

Fun-Raising Event

The Board of Religion is spon-
soring its annual carnival to
raise money for World Univer-

sity Service. The carnival, to
begin at 9 pm. this Saturday
in the North Lounge at the For-
um, will include on auction be-
ginning at about 10 pm.

World University Service is
an international organization de-
signed, in general, to aid uni-
versities and their students in
the developing countries. More
specifically, wus attempts to
improve living quarters and ii-
hraries, provide textbooks and
scientific equipment as needed.
For the individual student, WUS
otters scholarships and loans to
those who would otherwise be
unable to continue their educa-
tion, and is also concerned
about student health.

Halt or more of Saturday
night's proceeds will be ear-
marked ior Ahmednagar Cole
lege in lndia, the remainder to
be spent as wus sees tit. Grin-
nell has been Ahmednagar’s
benefactor tor several decades
and maintains an exchange
program with it.

in addition to donations of
money tor scholarships and ia-
Cilities, WUS is concerned with
the quality of student housing
and nutrition. It has been re
sponsible for the establishment
of hostels, health clin
dent cafeterias. and co-
tive stores.

World University Service op—
erates in more than sixty
countries in cooperation with
a number of United Nations of-
fices, including UNESCO, the
World Health Organization, the
Food and Agricultural Organi-
zation, and the UN High Com-
missioner tor Refugees. it also
cooperates with the Interna-
tion Student Conference.

Vespers

A break from studying: tit.
teen minutes or contemplative
relaxation; an opportunity (or
meditation and introspection: a
chance to be alone with your
private pleasure or pain; each
student has his own viewpoint
toward Grinnell's vespersr

Vesper services are held by
candlelight every Tuesday and
Thursday evening trom 9:45 to
10:01]. Generally, the Tuesday
evening service is given over to
music, the one on Thursday
evening to some sort of read»
ing.

The Board of Religion has
stated that any student's con-
tribution is welcome. whether
he wishes to sing, play all in-
strument, read a poem, or
merely make a suggestion.
Each participant or participat-
ing group is given virtually
complete treedorn as to how it
arranges the service

Chaplain Haas has noted that
most Vesper services are well<
attended. and takes this as an
indication that students appre»
ciate them. While attendance is
reasonably high, however, lew
litudents have volunteered to
conduct the service.

The Board of Religion has
expressed the hope or holding
additional services each week,
if student response is sutii»
cientiy strong. The Board is
also considering the use of re:
corded music for some serv-
ices.

Costa Rica: Student Research Opportunities

By ANN KlRSCHNER

Three Grinnell students spent parts of last year in
Costa Rico in the slums, in agricultural youth groups and

among the Meiastomataceae
family.

Nancy Moritz, Charles Schnell
and Paul Thurston were partici‘
pants in the Central American
Field Program sponsored by the

Associated Colleges of the Mid-
west and the National Science
Foundation, The program is a
research project in the natural
and social sciences, based at
the Tropical Science Center in
San Jose, the capital oi Costa
Rica. ,

Miss Moritz, a sociology ma-
Jor, spent the entire year

working on two projects. The
first was entitled “Socio-Ecu
nomic Factors inﬂuencing the
Success ur Failure of 4-5 Clubs
in Two Costa Rican Villages."
(The 4-5 clubs are somewhat
equivalent to our 4-H clubs.) The
second, on which she collabo
rated with Betty Schnell, was
“Educational Attitudes and Am-
bitions of Mothers for Their
Children in Selected Areas of
San Jose." In this project they
took a sample item the “tuguri-
os” (slums) and compared it to
a middle-income sample. They
iound that the attitudes were
class-linked in that greater in-
come and higher education

mote stronger ambitions for

Mr. Schnell, a biology major,
conducted studies on the ecol»
ogy oi the Melastomataceae;
one or the larger plant families
in the world.

Rural-Urban Migration

Mr. Thurston, who was there
second semester, is a history
major who made a sociological
and economic study oi the
slums in San Jose. He concen-
trated (in patterns or ruralvur-
ban migration and on income-
cost analysis, interviewing 75
families, and inund that over
50% were born outside San
Jose This is generally believed
to be because people in the
rural areas think they will ﬁnd
a better life in the cities. There
are, however, instances of ur-
ban-rural migration. Costa Rica
does not have as concentrated
a slum area as other parts of
Latin America, in which it
ranks about 7th in riches. it is
the richest in Central America.

Stable Democracy

Costa Rica maintains a stable,
democratic political system.
President Trejos is pro-Ameri-
can. The last political disturb-
lance occurred in 1947 and since
then democratic elections have
continued normally. The Grin-
nellians were in San Jose for
the national election last year
and said that one of thelr land-
ladies dragged her mattress
around to the back of her house
because she didn’t believe that
there was not going to be a
revolution.

The size or West Virginia,
Costa Rica has a varied
geography. There are cold
mountainous areas as well as
tropical jungles. Students doing
studies in the natural sciences
did extensive traveling, and
those in other iields had oppor-
tunities to accompany them.

Robert F. Voertman, econom-
lcs. organized the program and
is the coordinator for all the
participating colleges. The re
are three permanent staff mem-
bers in San Jose and a rotating
staff from A.C.M. Each student
carries out his project under
three advisers.

The program is designed to

He asked MacGregor, who is
chairman of the House Repub-
lican Task Force on Urban-Su-
burban Problems, “Will the
government accept a $100 billion
budget?"

Jones said that since the
movement has come north its
emphasis has shifted to the
massive economic, social. and
psychological problems that ex-
ist in city slums. Only vast
sums of money would eradicate
these problems, he asserted.

Jones said that the civil rights
movement to date, has been
aimed toward simply getting
basic legal rights for the Negro.
Inere has been northern sym<

pathy for this struggle, especial- E

[y while it: took place in the
South. But this summer, Mac-
Gregor said, “fear of black
power. equated with molotov
cocktails and brick throwing"
and reaction to the summer's
riots caused congressional reac-
tion which killed the ’66 righm
bill.

mittee and very active in civil
rights legislation mid of the
revival ol the hi 5 section on
the protection of Civil rights
workers (Title V). It makes a
federal offense of an act of vio-

lence wmmitted against those
who are trying to get for them-
selves or are helping others to
gain civil rights. It also con-
tains a controversial anti-riot

MacGregor also mentioned
the possibility tor passage
next year of the defunct bill‘s
section on nondiscriminatory
jury selection (Title ill). It al-
laws for the use of cnurt in-
junction when the right to
being judged by one's peers is

MacGregor claimed that some
civil righu leaders had asked
that the open housing section be
excluded Since it was [no late
to educate the public about the
issue. The rights leaders
thought that the open housing
controversy might jeopardize
the passage of the other sec-
tions.

about its content. The President
wanted to outlaw all sales and
rentals — an “insincere" posi-
tion according to MacGregor.
He thought it practical to have
some limitations on the bill, i.e.
in cases of llamliles. friends or
religious groups wanting to buy
or rent a house together.
Exchange

In discussion, MacGregor
denied that he had failed to
publicly state the bill’s dis.
tinction between reallors and
private home owners. Denis
deCoteau, music, stated that
legislators gave in to pressure
by realtors not to clarify this
distinction so that they would
have control over private sel-
lers.

MacGregor said that he ro~
ceived no pressure (mm the
renltors and that he had al-
ways taken the politically un-

popular position of opposing
the real estate lobby. Des
Coteau then claimed that
realtors did not try to pres-
s u r e congressmen directly
hut, according to personal ex-
perience in San Francisco,
they created opposition to the
open housing clause by de.
ceittully pitting ethnic groups
against one another.

Ezra Mendelsohn (history)
told MacGregor that civil rights
legislation today “isn’t rele-
vant” and that as the “richest
country in the world we should
be able to allocate an enormous
amount or money” to solve our
own socioeconomic problems.
MacGregor responded by di<
recting questions of govern-
mental appropriation to the ma-
jority party (not his),

Rights' Range

MacGregor agreed with Jones

that the future right: action
should focus on a wide range
oi poverty problems. but he
insisted that there was still a
great need for further legisla«
lion in the acquisition 0t basil:
rights.

The congressman drew the
line, however, at “forcible
reorganization ot society."
He recently voted against bus-
slng children in a school inte-
gration bill below his mm-
mlttee because he believes
“forcing integration“ is not
the function of lawmakers.
Asked how he thought the

white backlash would affect the
'68 elections, MacGregor pre-
dicted a "lurch to the right"
in the Democratic party. lie
said he hopcd this might prove
that “the Republicans are more
moderate than the Democratic
Left and more moderate than

ture yesterday. told the Shit:
“Bringing these things out in
the open would be beneficial to
everyone involved, My only
rear would be that this might
harden Puritan minorities, and
then. perhaps, nothing would be
gained.”

Many responsible people, in-
cluding the reviewer tor the
5&3, do not agree with Meyer’s
contention that the controver-
sial scene in “The Chairs" so
seriously affected the audience
that they went away thinking
nothing else about the play. He
is entitled to his views, but he
must also allow Tor other opin-
ions. In eensoring the play he
closed the door on rational dis-
cussion.

We think a good edumtional
opportunity was lost when “The
Chairs" was censored. it the
matter had been approached in
an intellectual manner students
could have examined the issues
involved and learn a great deal.
Student directors could gain a
better idea how their audience
reacts on morally questionable
matters. The (acuity could offer
needed guidance. and could also
learn more about “student at.
litudes." Discussion would
also help everyone keep a clear
separation between the student
actor as a character on stage
and as a student they know per~
sonally. We do not believe that
students will be hurt by seeing
something controversial like
"The Chairs."

By eliminating censorship,
faculty and administration
would he spared oi the very
embarrassing and ethically dit<
ficult situation into which Mey<
er and SomerVille put each
other. M a n y knowledgeable
people think Meyer went to the
extreme or overruling another
faculty member because, as
his experience with “The
Knack” indicated, he had to
support the indeiinite but de-
cisive administration position
on obscenity. This is a deplor-
able situation and one that les-
sens stutlent respect ior all in-
Volved.

Some faculty members have
told the 5&3 that they are

"categorically opposed to any
censorship on campus." One
can only speculate what would
happen it a iaculty member
who takes [his stand becomes
involved in a situation like that
of “The Chairs."

We are of the opinion that the
basis oi the problem, and per-
haps the only reason that cen-
sorship still goes on here, is ad-
ministration and faculty cun-
cem for the “morally correct
and nonrcontroversial" image
oi Grinnell College.

Much oi the confusion and
contradiction of past dis
cussion on censorship has
resulted tram attempting to
bypass not only the question oi
what is the “good image” but
how permitting supposedly im-
moral works of art to exist here
effects that image.

These are questions that need
thought and discussion. We do
not think it would be very dil-
iicult to sell the ideas of “artis-
tic freedom” and “freedom of
the press" to the outside world
oi alumni, money givers, trus-
tees, parents, etc. We would
point to the administration’s
handling or the “drug issue" as
the type of constructive ap-
proach needed.

lt censorship on moral
grounds is eliminated the col-
lege need not fear a deluge of
obscene student art. We think
Grinnell students are sensitive
people. And when questionable
matters do arise, student and
iaculty criticism would act as
eflective restraints. As Meyer
told the 5&Bl “I believe that If
we had no censorship there
would be problems, but. this
would not matter in the long

Monmouth Pioneers’ Next Prey

The Pioneer football team,
wlnless in its ﬁrst three games,
will try to escape the cellar
this week when they play at
Monmouth. Last week the Plo-
lleers fell to an inspired Knox
team 14-7 in what was supposed
to have been a fairly easy game.

Again this week the Pioneers
will be facing what should be
an easy game. Monmouth has
also lost all three of its games
and ranks last in the league in
both team offense and defense
They have been outscored 128-
28 in those three games includ-
ing a 47—0 loss to Ripon last
Week.

Meanwhile the Pioneers are
not looking so ferocious either.
Although they do not have sta-
tistics as bad as Monmouth's,
their play has kept them near

the bottom of the league in sta<
tistics.

Coach Edd Bowers was na<
tut-ally disappointed at the re-
suit and pointed at several key
areas that needed improvement.
First of all is team attitude. The
Knox bench was able to show
more desire than tile Pioneers'
all day.

On the field the Pioneers need
mainly to improve their block-
ing, punting, and passing.

The Pioneers were able to
complete only two passes
against Knox. one in each half.
in the three games the Pioneers
have completed only l6 for 149
yards.

The punting was had also The
Pioneers were able to average

only 29 yards a punt and a cou-
pie were under 20.

All three oi the touchdowns in
the game were scored after the
team recovered a fumble. On the
third play or the game Knox
fumbled and Bob Lillis picked it
up on the Knox 30. After being
helped by a penalty, the Pity
neei's drove for the score, in the
second period Knox picked up
a Pioneer fumble on the Pioneer
45 and drove for the score, but
missed the extra point and were
trailing 7-6 at half. 0n the third
play of the third quarter Knox
picked up a fumble on the Grin-
neil in Six plays later they scor-
ed and made a two point conver-
sion.

 

CCers Up for Monmouth Meet

The Pioneer cross country
team will be trying to regain
the winner‘s circle tomorrow
when they taco Monmouth at
Monmouth. Last Saturday the
Pioneers finished a disappoint.
ing fifth in the Les Duke invir
tational and lost a dual meet to
Chicago.

Coach Ray Ohermiller was
very dissatisfied with his team:
performance. He said that this
was the worst performance of
the squad all year.

ngh finisher for the Pin-
nears was John Sharpe, who
ﬁnished sixteenth. He was

Other finishers for the Plo-
neers were Doug Dray, sev-
enteenth, . Steve Brintnail,
twenty-sixth, Spencer Clark,
thirty-first, and Steve Mont-
gomery, thirty-seventh, in the
sixty man field.

Obermiller noted that the 0p-
pressive heat held down the
times Even the winner, Karri-
steadt of Central did not run in
his normal time although he set
a new meet record. Kamsteadt
is regarded as one oi the best

-—® in the nation in smell—college

competition. The record he
broke was Gene Takle’s of Lu-
ther, who won the small college
crown last year.

Although the Pioneers did do
poorly last week, Obermiller
still holds high hopes tor the
team in the conference meet_
The addition to the team of let<
terman Bob Grant is one of the
reasons. Also several members
of the team have not yet run
close to their potential this year.
included in this group is co
captain Sharpe.

Tomorrow the Pioneers will
be facing Monmouth and it fig-
ures to be a close race Both
teams take similar records into
the meet including wins over
Cornell.
