Kimbo Describes Broodened Counseling Program

by Marilyn McKenna

Part I

Where is the counselingpros
gram at Grinnell headed? Ac
cording to Grinnell's Dean of
Students, Conney M. Kimbo,
the movement within the pro
gram now is toward providing
as much variety as possible
in the forms of counseling

, available, in order tomeet the
needs of individuals in a het-
erogeneous campus commun-
ity. This is the first ina series
of articles examining these
services and focusing on the
current developments which
will shape counseling at Grins
nell in the future.

Much of the current counsel»
ing activity is related to the
offices of the Deans of Studs
ents. Dean Kimbo, Associate
Dean Jean Hinds, and ASSlSt’
ant Dean Ric MacDowell are

all available to any student
who desires counseling orgui-
dance, although each does
work in separate as well as
interrelated areas.

Kimbo, a teacher for ten
years in the Gary, Indiana
public school system and cur
rently enrolled in a doctoral
program inadministration and
higher 611than at the Unis
versity of Iowa, is actively
involved in the development of
a variety of counseling servir
ces at Grinnell. He believes
it is necessary to have differ-
ent kinds of counselors be‘
cause a personality conflict
may not allow a student to
get the help he needs from a
particular counselor.

The resident-advising sysr
tem, under the guidance ofthe
Deans of Students, exempli-
fies the emphasis on variety.
Concerning selection of the

resident advisors for this
year, Kimbo says thata defr
inite effort was made to get a
well‘qualifled but varied
group of young, interested
people able to work with stud-
ents and relate to their needs.
They are to try, with the SEU'
dents, to improve the living
situations within the halls, not
through disciplinary tactics,
but through a loiowledge ofgr-
oup living. Mr. Kimbo sees
life within the halls and the
R.A.'s role as primary areas
for consideration andimproc
vement in the counseling pro-
gram.

Jean Hinds, Associate Dean,
received a Doctor of Educa-
tion degree in counselingpsys
chology at Columbia Univerr
sity and served as Associate
Director of the University Co-
unseling Service at Howard
University. She too believes in

Senate Raises Officers’ Salaries

pus radio smtion, or read an
issue of SStB’I Well,you better

your Manley is going down the
drain! very year $47 of you
or your parents’ hard earned
msh goes into the Student Gov-
ernment Association budget,
which is allotted bythe Fins
ance Committee to a number
of campus funds which cover
the activities just mentioned
plus many,more. During the
Senate meetings of October 5
and 6 the Senate, largely unr
noticed by the rest ofthe cam—
pus, approved a budget which
allocated $55,335 ofyour mon-
ey to the various funds.

Well over half the budget
(some $32,800) went into the
hands of the Social Coordinar
ting Committee, a group of

' seven salaried students (hea-
ded by Peter Keepnews)whose
job it is to decide what sort of
entertainment will be brought
to campus this year. Besides
$900 for salaries, money was
allotted for movies ($6050),
the Forum Coffee House
($300), small concerts
($4000), informal recreation
($400), and a general Social
Coordinating Fund ($1100).
The largest single chunk($20,
000) went into the Concerts
fund, headed by Concerts ch-
airman RonaldStanford, tobrr
ing to campus such entertain-
ers as the East River Anthor
logy and Big Mama Thornton.

The second largest area of
the budget was Publications
and Radio. KDIC received
$3300, $1800 of which is al»
lotted for the salaries of the
six members of the executive
board. The Scarlet and Black
received an appropriation of
$5500. $1000 of the Scarlet
and Black money is spent for
the salaries of the Editor and
Business Manager.

A tetal of $900 was approp-
riated for the Student Audits
or's office ($500 for the sal-

- ary of Student AudltOI’Rle
Deyo), and $2000 each for the

Speaker's Fund and the newly
created Senate Fund, a "last
chance" fund to which student
groups can apply for money if
their particular request does
not fit under the definition of
any of the other campus funds.
One of the major issues face
ing the Finance Committee
this year was the question of
whether or not the college
should allow student funds to
go for the purchasing ofliquor.
Last year virtually oneethird
of the Initiative Fund money
was spent for alcoholic beV’
erages. After considering the
legal and practical aspects of
the problem, the Finance
Committee voted lhatmoney it
appropriated would not be
spent for any alcoholic beve-
rages, this decision to be
enforced by the Student Audiv
tor, who will carefully scru-
tinize purchase receipts. With
this in mind, the Committee
allotted $4000 for the Initia~
,tive Fund, to be administered
by the Initiative Fund com*
mittee under previously'set
guidelines.

The nature of the Hall A1107
cation fund was changed this
year. Rather than being used
for the purchase ofhallnewsr
paper subscriptions, repairs
of hall damages, and new equr
ipment, the fund is now intend-
ed to be onlya source ofmoney,
for group hall activities, such
as hall parties, dances, etc.
$1800 was appropriated to be
divided among the various
halls. To cover the previous-
ly mentioned hall expendir
tures, a joint Council ofHouse
Presidents , Associated WoV
men Students fund was crea-
ted, to be administered by
both organizations. The total
was set at $1500.

$2535 was also allotted to
the Student Government Asso-
ciation itself, the 1arge part
of it ($2050) for salaries ofthe
various SGA officers. For se-
veral years the traditional
salaries of SGA officers had
been: $300 for SGA President;
$250 each for C of HP Presir
dent, AWS President, and Stu-
dent Coordinator; $200 for the
SGA Secretary; and $100 each

for two Student Coordinator
assistants. This year the Fin-
ance Committee felt that such
salaries were too low in view
of the level of some of the
other salariesaround campus,
specifically those of the SStB
Editor and Business Manager,
the Student Auditor, and the
executive board of the radio
station. The Finance Commit‘
tee recommended incrases
in SGA salaries to the folloWr
ing levels: $500 each for SGA
President and Student Coor-'
dinator, $300 each for the Cof
HP and AWS Presidents, $125
each for the Student Coordine
ator Assisnants, and the prev-
ious level of $200 for the SGA
Secretary.

needs in many different coun-
seling situations. It is also
necessary, Miss Hinds feels,
to constantly reevaluate the
role of a clean in counseling
as well as in other areas, in
relationship to changes in cola
lege life.

Besides extensive work in
counseling in general, Miss

developed Career Planning

' Wall Presents Tutorial Plan

by John Pepper
and Tim Porges

The opening tone of this
week’s faculty differed from
the previous 8 meetings de-
voted to reform of academic
requirements for graduation.
In three speeches, it was

Students And Prols Cooperate

In lEAP Ant'

A step in the right direction
in the fight against local pol—
lution is Grinnell's iniZEIdlS’
ciplinary effort, the LEAP
program. This is a core grr
oup of 29 students and five
faculty from several depart-
ments who hope to develop a
package program to combat
pollution which could be of-
fered to other communities
similar to Grinnell.

The LEAP group was organ-
ized last springbutactivedata
gathering and study ofthe pro-
blems in Grinnell diantstart
until this fall. During the sum-
mer a small group ofstudents
and faculty worked on general
outlines for the program and
developed plans for itsactivi‘
ties. A rather extensive bib-
liography of information was
also compiled.

This semester is mainly cons
cerned with the work of data
githering, initial testing, and
analysis. Some ideas for re
cycling and pollution solutions
are alsobeing considered. The
second semester will be or-
iented more towards solving
some of the problems defined
during this fall's investiga-

Pollution Survey

tions. Action will be taken that
will include experimental re-
cycling and other plans. Dur~
ing the second semester es
pecially widespread campus
involvement will be essential
for the program's success.
Student interest and coopera-
tion so far have been very
good and its continuance will
be increasingly vital.

LEAP is composed of sev-
eral main groups each headed
by a faculty member and haw
ing several students as its
core. These groups are: the
solid wastes group headed by
Kenneth Christensen of the
biology department; the chef
mical waste group headed by
Gene Wubbles of the chemis-
try department; the ICE (in
ternal combustion engine)
team, headed by Steve Gold
and the Statistical analysis
and economics group headed
by Robert Voertman ofthe ec-
onomics department which
will study some of the econo-
mic problems of pollution. In
addition to these groups is the
publicity and coordinating
team (which oversees the

made clear that a consensus
to cut finally on some difui-
tive legislations was being
asked. Professor Erickson
formally withdrew hispending
proposal, saying that he felt
it had little chance of pass-
age, and that the faculty sh~
ould be looking for something
that it could pass.

Chairman Joseph Wall spoke
for some ten minutes, review
ing the course by which the
various faculty summer study
committee proposals were
disposed of, and noting the
modification in debate engen-
dered by a plethora of faculty
position papers. He empha-
sizes ”this is the time to
cut."

Mr. Clotfelter,whose earlier
proposal for the complete eliv
mination of requirements was
earlier defeated, rose to pro-
pose a new scheme, the floor
having beenvoidedby thewith-
drawal of the Erickson docu-
ment.

The text of the newproposal,
which appears under Dean
Wall‘s name, is as follows
(in abbreviated form).

1. That the faculty approve
of a Freshman Tutorial pro-
gram as the one college re-
quirement for the freshman
year. Each freshman would
be required to take a tutorial
during the first semester of
his freshman year. Eachfre-
shman would select or be as-
signed to a tutor, and each
tutor would be responsible for
no more than twelve students.
The tutor would ordinarily
serve as the student's under»
class academic advisor, until

Repression: Canada . . .

UnnOticed amid the remarkable apathy that has shrouded
Grinnell students to an unusual degree (even for them) this fall
has been a major event on the internationalscene that has grave
portent for civil liberties andsocial change in the United States.
I speak of the extraordinary invocation of the War Measures
Act by Premier Pierre Trudeau of Canada in order to deal with
the terrorism (and the two recent kidnapings) by Le Front de
Liberation de Quebec (FLQ) and the complete equanimity with
which that action was received by the Canadian people.

The War Measures Act, previously used only during WWI&II,
allows the government to arrest anyone without a warrant and
to hold them without charge for up to 21 days. Trudeau, in
announcing the new powers (which did not require parliamenc
tary,approval for institution), saidthatarrests wouldbe limited
to FLQ members and "sympathizers." However, the highest
estimates of active FLQ membership have been about 120;
more than 430 persons have been arrested (of which number
more than 175 have been released, leaving at least 250 still
imprisoned). There are anestimated2,000 "inactive"members
of FLQ.

The War Measures Act has been used so far to justify more
than 1,600 raids on private homes, suppression of any state
ments of support for the FLQ, prohibition of the publimtion in
Canadian newspapers of any FLQ statements, arrest of anyone
suspected of any association whatever with the FLQ. Students,
reporters, workers, politicians (two candidates for mayor of
Montreal were arrested) all have been arrested and face up to
five years in prison unless THEY um DISPROV'E even a remote
connection with or support for the FLQ.

The War Measures Act in Canada violates many of the basic
civil liberties that Americans (and Canadians) have long taken
for granted. However, what little opposition thatwas expressed
to Trudeau's move was stifled after the murder of one of the
hostages, an'act that wasprovokedat least in part by the unduly
harsh measures invoked by the government. Trudeau won a
confidence vote in parliament 190* 16, with the only opposition

' coming from a small minority of leftists who said the govern-
ment was "using a sledgehammer to crack a peanut."

For those who say.“ cannot happen beret-think twice. The
government is already doing its best to eliminate the Black
Panthers, and the public's extreme concern with law—and-
order following this year's rash of bombings rwill tempt the
feds to take strong measures soon. The lack ofa backlash to
the suspension of civil liberties in (‘anadawill tempt American
politiml leaders even more. Expressions of support that the
government has sent to Canada recently do not make me feel
any better.

In 1968 when 10 Mexican students were killed in rioting in
Mexico City just before the Olympics, I rejoiced that sucha
tragedy could not happen here. It happened. Let Canada be a

better lesson for us all.
d h
u o a all o lo

' Speaking of repression and alluding to Kent State, recent de-
velopments in Ohio immediately come to mind. As most of you
know, 25 students and faculty members have been indicted by
grand jury and the National Guard has been whitewashed by the
same group. While Icannot express surprise,my dismay cannot
be withheld. Will the Feds allow the state to continue? Will the
Scranton Commission's platitudes remain just that? Will the
newly- regained apathy of college students allow the forces of
selective law and order to continue to makea mockery of their
own slogan? Remembering the Fred Hampton case in Qiicago
and watching the same pattern being repeated atJackson State,
I am afraid my questions become merely rhetorical. it makes
Agnew's words sound like extreme understatements when he
says "Americans prefer repressiontoanarchy." Recent events
make one wonder if Americans aren't ready to take Erich
Fromm's "Escape from Freedom." The burden seems too
great for them to bear.

Bill Thomas Explains Position

Dear Sir:

Last week in your paper an
article appeared intimating
that I might be a mndidate for
the honorable ofﬁce of presi-
dent of the Student Govern-
ment Association. Much as I
am flattered by the thought
that I would be worthy of that
position, I feel that I must
make clear, as my responsi—
bility to the people of this fine
college, my position in regard
to the upcoming race,

I disavow, firmly and unequr
ivomlly, the statement thatl
will probably run for SGA pre-
sident. Although this would be
a wonderful opportunity for
me, and although I would cer-
mainly enjoy the experience of
serving our community, my
present assessment of mypo-
sitlon in the Grinnell political
sphere and my present pro-
jected commitments for the
forthcoming college year draw
me to the conclusion that l
would be unable to harness
myself to the buggy of Student
Government.

The office of SGA president

is a grave responsi ility, one
not to be taken lightly, and
certainly one calling for the
highest degree of tact, arti-
culation, and plain old horse
sense. He that as it may, I
must report to the voters that
I am definitely not' currently
in the running.
yours for the people,“

anvill Smith of the Physics
department. About 200 volun-
teers have participated in
LEAP, many of them by wei-
ghing garbage, reading odo-
meters or gathering otherda‘
ta.

For this year at least, LEAP
is concentrating on the collec
ge's pollution problems. The
solid waStes group has com-
pleted one three week mea-
suring period and plans to
start another after mid-sem-
ester break and a third in
December. This group is try-
ing to determine ways of les-
sening the considerable am~
ount of solid wastes we pro-
duce at Grinnell. The possi-
bility of grading paper and
selling it exists and bottles
and cans may be recycled.
All recycling plans, however,
are tentative at this point.
There really is not enough in-
formation now to allow forany
extensive planning of solu-
tions.

A survey of the dorms willbe
made after the mid- sem break
by the chemical wastes group
to try to determine chemical
pollution and energy uses of
students. Hopefully, after lea-
rning how We behave LEAP
will offer suggestions as to
how we can make our behav-
ior less damaging to the eco-
logy.

Eventually LEAP hopes to
involve the town in its prog-
ram and cooperate with it in
developing a program for oth-
er small communities simi-
lar to Grinnell to combat their
pollution problems.

Faculty Votes Hot To Vote; Debate To Continue

(continued from page 1)
clares a major.

2. That the faculty shouldap—
prove of a Freshman Year
Committee consisting of the
Dean of the College; faculty
and student members, which
would supervise the tutorial
program’s development and
execution, draw up a list of
faculty members tobe recom-
mended as tutors, disseminate
to the faculty such suggest-
ions for new programs for the
freshman year as it would in-
itiate or receive from studs
ents or faculty, and supervise
the Underclass Academic Ad-
vising program.

3, That the faculty express
support for the continuation of
existing freshman year coure
ses in the humanities, social
studies and science, or the
development ‘of new courses,
which would be available to
freshmen on anelective basis.

The debate which ensued res
capitulated earlier meetings
in ranging from the technical
to the demunciatory to the es-
chatological.

Faculty secretary Valentine
rose to make some general
remarks about the quality of
the previous debate, which be
termed “careless". Valentine
termed the faculty’s consid*

eration of its own legislation
”far from complete."The Hut
manities Divisions 1572 bloc
v0te for retention of the re
quired Humanities coursewas
not noted once in the debate,
he said, accusing the faculty
of taking depart-mental and
divisional interests as para-
mount in consideration of the
proposed reforms.

According with the maxim
that the time had come to
act, the faculty voted to
consider provision (2d), wh-
ich Mr. Worley then pro-
posed to amend to the ex~
tent that the proposed Fre
eshman year committee
have sovereignty over all
required courses, regard-
less of which year they may
be given.

Mr. Cleaver noted that this
would make little sense were
the lst provision (to estab~
lish the tutorial program) not
to pass.

Hence the faculty decided to
consider provision 1.

However, it was then sugges~
ted that no one would vote on
provision 1 unless the imple-
mentary procedures were
esmblished.

So the faculty voted to cont
sider provisions 1 and 2.

some length, reminding the
faculty rather pointedly that
more of these proposals c0“.
Id be effective without a firm
committment from the faculty
that they work. Further, he
noted, a study of course pop-
ulations at the 100-200 level
as compared to the 3004100
level had shown that faculty
must be willing to give up the
occasional upperelevel sem-
inar to implement the tutorial
program. Moreover, he felt
that faculty would have to ch-
ange the orientation of their
introductory courses; court
ses which he characterized
as offered frequently at "a
high school level.

With a general confusion abs
road as to just whatthe guide-
lines would be--how confin-
ing, how instructivewan at»
tempt was made to call the
question; to bring the original
motion of Wall's to a vote.
The call was voted down, and,
in two tries, the faculty voted
to adjourn.

In voting not to vote the fac-
ulty has extended debate on
the new package of nOtrequ~
irementsrbut-lutorlal hum-
anities and an improved in-
troductory curriculum for
two, maybe three weeks. The
meetings are still open (oh
joyl) to students, and every
minute of two hours long, ste
arting at four o'clock Monday
evening. It is worthnotingthat
the faculty senate has consis-
tently evidenced sincere and
categorical unanimityas to the
time of day.

the recommendations were
cast aside as the Senate den
bated several motions to re
lower or redistribute the sale
ary money. Finally a motion
by Senator Kit Cage to equals
ize the salaries of the four
members of the SGA execu~
rive board gained support. The
debate dragged on until the
closing minutes of [hemeetr
ing, when Andy Loewi, with a
nervous glance at his watch,
made a briefspeechinsupport
of the motion with some dubs
ious logic about "enhancing
the position of the halls." At
two minutes until twelve o'cl-
ock the Senate then passed
Gage's motion and equalized
the salaries of the Student
Coordinator, SGA President,
C of HP President, and AWS
President at $400 apiece.

Harriers Place Third At Coe
Eric John Takes Top Honors

Eric "the Quick" Jahn led
Grinnell’s not-so-jolly jog~
gers to an overall third place
finish in the Coe Invitational
at Cedar Rapids. Eric took
top long distance runner hon—
ors on the muddy course last
Friday. Grinnell finished bee
hind St. Ambrose and Dubuque
as the rest ofrhe team seemed
to be on a "downer” for the
meet. Grinnell was listed asa
very strong contender; but
with junior star Chuck “Short-
cut" McGrath ailing, the team
is losing a high finisher.

The way the members fin-
ished: Jahn lat, McGrath 6th.
Russell 11th. Frank 14th.
Mendenhall 19th, Oscar 24th,
Stein 26th.

To save their strength, they
have cancelled their skirmish

with Ripon this week. The real '

reason perhaps being that evr
erybody wants to go home and
Coach 0 could not get his son

THE SCARLET AND BLACK

October 29, 1970

GriddersContinue To Roll, 22-21

The Big Red apparently likes
to play the close onesand give
everybody coronaries. Or
maybe the Pioneers like to
prove that they can win in the
clutch, that they can come up
with the Big Play whenever
they have to. Last week they
did it against nonrconference
foe Beloit (non~ conference be
cause, contrary to conferen—
ce rules, Beloit is playing fre
cshmen on the varsity foot-
ball squad this year due to a
lack of varsity bodies), by the
miniscule margin ofonepoint,
22-21.

It looked as though Grinnell
would blow this game apart
early, as Darling Bill Dicks
picked off a pass from Bel‘
oit's Jim Nitz on the fourth
play of the game. Shortly th-
ereafter, Gorgeous Gary Jo-
hnson found Mafia Jim Firolr
li in the endzone witha seven-
yard strike. When placer kick—
er Twinkle-toes Roy Lewis
missed the extra point, the
score was 6-0, Pioneers.Tw-
inkle-toes, in making right
his wrong, then put the kick-
off into the end zone, where
Beloit's receivers tried a
handroff and reverse. HowV

Pink Toy Falls Again

The Freshman Football team
has done it againi Capping a
perfect season, with an un‘
blemished Win Column, the
preps were defeated by Coe
in their season's finale, 404).
This was definitely a moral
victory after last week’s
fiasco of a 76-0 rout by the
Knox preps. An unblemished
win column was not all this
undaunted squad is the pos-
sessor of. It also is unble-
mished in their number of
points scored in one season,
0. A defensive record was set
also in that 149 points were
scored against them. This
breaks the record of 121
points,‘ set by the laSt 0-3
prep squad of 1966.

Deceivingly, there are some
good players on this team.
Especially the linemen, who
will add greatly to nextyear's
team, according to Coach B07
were. All in all, this team

showed how the game is real-
ly supposed to be played, just

much fun as winning though.

ever, the reverse was foiled
when the Big Red Machine's
kick~off team displayed rare
speed and tackled Beloit's re-
turn man in the end-zone for
a safety, to run the score to
870. Grinnell then took the
ensuing free kick and drove in
for another score, with the big
play being a 37-yard bomb
from G.G. to Henry “the F1-
ash" Corona in the end zone.
This time, the PAT was good
and the Homecoming Wreck-
ers were on top 15-0.

In the second quarter, Beloit
was driving, only to have Jef—
fie Dick pick off a Nitz pass
on the Grinnell eight and lum~
her all the way for a TD. Ber
loit, however, mme rightback
to score, Nitz throwing 29
yards to Dick Bartolomei for
the home team's second tour
chdown. The first half ended
with Grinnell up 22-15.

The fourth quarter was so-
mewhat wilder, as Grinnell's
offense failed to score any-
more, but Beloit’s did not.
With 6:21 left in the game,
their QB smashed over from
the one. Beloit then went for
all the marbles and a two
point conversion. This time,
however, they were stopped
short and the score remained
22*21, Grinnell. Grinnell then
killed four and a halfminutes,
but Beloit wasn’t through yet.
They mounted their finaldrive
of the day, and had victory in
their grasp, when the Pione
eer’s great defense came up
with their fourth Big Play:
Mafia Jim picked off a Nitz
pass in the end zone with 21
seconds left.

IT’S
All
TOGETHER

 

The Big Red Machine facesa
severe test this Saturday asil
meets the Redmen of Ripon.
Last year, Grinnell stungRip-
on with a relatively easy vic—
tory. It willne’erbe sosimple
this time around. However,
with the Pioneers' penchant
for pursuing the close ones,
and winning them, they won't
exactly be blown off the field,
either. Grinnell is fully mp“
able of making the Big Play.
The Pioneers should pull it

out, 20-18. "-Ro Speaks
