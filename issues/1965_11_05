Special Supplement

In the longest issue of the
paper in over four years, the
Sud; staff has prepared an
eightspage supplement in which
we focus on the slum conditions
of three Cities — Chicago, Des
Moines, and Grinnell. The sup-
plement comprises pages 5
through 12 of this week’s 5&3.
Two teams of photographers
and reporters spent the mid-
semester break in researching
the stories for the supplement.

Special thanks go to Sue Tay-
lor and Krys Neiiman for as-
sisting in gathering information
in Chicago. Thanks also go to
our printers, who were kind
enough not to yell at us.

“while the faculty panel discus-
sion and the teachin last spring
were significant and valuable con
tributions, we feel that a more
disciplined and r i g or ou s ap-
proach to the issues from varying
frames of reference might lead
to greater understanding of the
problem, as well as raise the tenor
of political commentary to a new
level of responsibilityK legitimacy

Specifically, the group will split
up into three smaller study
groups, called international Sys
tems, Social Change and Econom-
ic Development, and Revolution»
ary Warfare. Faculty members
serving on the International Sys-
tems study group are: Charles
Cleaver (English), Richard Win-
ters (assistant dean), Alan Jones
(history), Raymond Beth (his.
tory), and Joseph Wail (history).
Bill Barnes is the student chair-
man of this committee.

Serving as faculty sponsors on
the Social Change and Economic
Development committee are: Ro-

Guaranteed Fees

On the agenda for this weekend’s meeting of the
Board of Trustees is consideration of a student fee in-
crease for next year.

We would like to say some things about fees and
Ihe tendency of college administrators to raise them.

, Average tuition at 99 selected private institutions,
according to the American Council on Education's Fact
Book, is somewhat over $1,200 (Grinnell’s is $1,640).
The U.S. Office of Education reports that the average
‘cost of room and board is $700 (Grinnell’s is $850),
The USOE also notes that incidental costs of transpor-
tation, clothing, textbooks, and recreation run between
$500 and $1,000. (Grinnell’s official incidental fees —
health, activities, and admissions fees —« run to $110;
you can make your own estimate on personal expenses.)
Grinnell’s trustees have pushed the comprehensive
fee to its present $2,600 level by small jumps since 1957,
when the fee was $1,550. These increases, which have
become an annual autumn tradition at Grinnell, have
the effect of making the four-year cost of a Grinnell
education about $1,000 more than could be anticipated
in a student‘s college-planning days.
' Fee increases are unpleasant but necessary, the
dministrators tells us. ”Institutions of higher learn-
ing are subject to three principle forces making for
l necessary increase in operating cost. Increasing en-
tollments, the need for higher faculty salaries, and
necessary instructional improvements are demands
.which cannot be ignored," an Ohio university adminis-
trator pointed out earlier this year at the National Con-
ference on Higher Education.

But the problems of yearly fee increases can’t be
ignored, either. One trouble with fee increases is that
fcholarships aren’t raised commensurately. And even
f that $100 or $150 increase can be absorbed by more
money from home, it just isn’t good public relations.

So we would like to suggest that the trustees seri-
ously consider the plan, now in effect at St. Olaf Col-

ege, whereby students contract with the college on
.What their tuition will be for four years. This plan al-
lows students to estimate their college expenses ac-
curately and protects the school against large numbers
of transferring students in the final two years.

We might further suggest that Grinnell students
be allowed to contract for their entire comprehensive
fee to guard against room, board, and incidental fee in-
creases which would make a guaranteed tuition an
empty sales feature,

A guaranteed comprehensive fee is, very simply,‘

a good idea.

Friday, November I. IN!

Jenks' Journal

This is my first entry, I have been keeping this
journal, as i suppose almost everyone has, without
ever having written anything, permitting instead
the cellular matter of perception and reflection to
collect itself and settle into the back of my brain as

a kind of intuitional embryo. I might wait for this
child to develop unconsciously and of itself and be
born, someday, into wisdom of word or deed or both.
but I fear delusion: the hidden transformation of
that waiting into a vain remembering, into a subtly
consuming attempt to ﬁx the point in time that the
pregnancy was absorbed. For perhaps that cellular
matter, unexpressed, is only that — cerebral waste,
Rather than allow the issue of my experience to he
liom an orphan or in die through my own careless-
ness or cowardice, I have resolVEd to work feeling
into thought, to parent the infant, if he exists, by
communicating him.

Our genius escapes us. oenuis is that thought
which goes on continuously and by itself, like diges-
tion, and is exposed only in those fleeting moments
when we are not thinking: while we are brushing
our teeth, for example, or tying our shoes, or falling
asleep in the shower. It is then that we least expect.
the phenomenon of insight, so that it darts back
into the thicket before we realize that we are hunt-
ers. We are left vaguely troubled, feeling that some-
thing has eluded us, that we have been visited by a
certainty which we cannot identity. A remnant oi
last night’s forgotten dream, we might think. A: the
noise or the sub-vocal soliloquy called thinking is re-
sumed, the event seems to lose significance; the in-
sight is obscured the instant we engage our minds
in its pursuit.

The genius is able to think Wlthout talking to him-
self. His utterances annihilate themselves, exposing
the profound silence that was their source. We can-
not discover the knowledge available to him either
by “sitting down" or “going out" to search for it,
because we are ourselves that knowledge, and in<
separable from it. it clings to us like the ocean to
the hull of a boat that ﬂoats upon it. It cannot be
grasped, as a hand cannot grasp itself; it cannot be
expressed, as a word cannot define itself. Yet it re~
aides and operates in us at every moment, determin-

ing that we do what we heed to do, whether or not
we know what those needs are. We can communicate
these elaborate instincts only by demonstrating
them, by responding spontaneously and authentically
to their impulses. But we are only ordinary mortals:
our utterances confound our intuition and corrupt
our responses. Thus our communication will be, at
best, imperfect

Inspired by'a solitary ten minutes in a halfv
darkened Scarlet and Black office, a nostalgia for
the rolledvup shirtsleeve and green visor, and a de-
sire to participate in the potent disorder of reporting
these evanescent days, this journal will be an im—
perfect attempt to iii-rest and surround the occasion-
a1 insights that visit me. It may be necessary for me
to do a lot or tooth-brushing and shoe-tying and
shower-sleeping in order to gel material; but I urge
the reader to make inferences. to consider its execu-
tion and the implications of its existence as well as
its subject matter. If the journal fails as s piece at
writing, it will yet unwittingly demonstrate certain
facts about its author, who claims to represent a (ll-
mension of the student mind that is somewhat
neglected in these pages. l begin with the assump»
tlon that the intellectual and spiritual matters which
concern me cannot be drastically unlike those which
concern all of us; we are, after all, members of the
same generation and of the same community.

New I am writing it all down, and it seems that
whatever is written ought to be read, When it ap-
pears in print, 1 shall certainly read it, with the
vanity of one who cannot take his eyes from a
photograph of himself. But I shall not be the artless
impersonator that we encounter in our own photo-
graphs, hut simply anonymous, to those who know
me and even, maybe, to myself. For this journal
will not record those external features that dis»
tinguish me from other individuals, but will receive
reflections and beliefs, the internal features that are
hidden in the particular silence of each of us, It is
perhaps this silence that I wish to penetrate, to over-
come by example the isolation of appearmces. I am
satisfying ii special need and doing, I feel, what
many people would like lo do. Maybe everyone
should have ii newspaper column.

trains and rivers

I've been asked to say something by way of in»
trlxluction about Son House, the Negro blues singer,
prior to his performance here tomorrow nighl, and
don't know exactly where to begin.

For one thing, Son House is one of an older gen-
eratioll oi Negro country blues artists who were born
in the Mississippi ”Delta" region. recorded a few
“race records" in the 20's and 30's, and then disap—
peared back into the bleak obscurity oi the nonhem
Mississippi Countryside. And unlike many of the re-
discovered country performers currently singing [0
the college folk “revival,” Son House is “pure Delta,"
which means he helped invent and develop some of
[he most haunting, driven, bitter and psychologically-
lnlense music in Western culture. From Charlie
Patton, Son House and Willie Brown through Robert
Johnson to Muddy Waters, and John Lee Hooker,
the Delta Style is the "mainstream" in country
blues, the central point of influence for every other
kind of “blues" muSlC from hillbilly to sophisticated
jazz to rock-and-roll. IL is also, according to News~
week, “our finest native-born music,”

The original Negro blues were conceived —
somewhere, at some time ~ as an extension of group
music into 3 [arm in which the individual Singer
could improvise freely around some introspective,
personal theme. The metaphor “the blues” has come
to be associated with many things, but it originally
meant die total injection and alienation from society
is» by the rural Southern Negro, experienced in the
harsh, practical terms of his daily existence. An i
tense environment was bound lo produce intense i
dividuals, and it was the illiterate artists in this out-
cast spoiely, the singers and untrained country
gnilanplayeis, ivliu capiuml Lhis intensity in its most
brilliant and hallucinatory furm.

The creative blues artist had to have the poet’s
outlook — “the ab' ' m state the truths of his time
he mum of, Son House is thus

the music of poverty, exhausting labor, the fears oi
the Mississippi Negro under the lynch-law govern
ment of the 20's and 30's, as well as the loves and
yearnings of an intellect sensitive to a Dostoyevskian
predicament. On another level it is the music of a
tragic vision trying to cope with the particular: or its
destiny.

There are, of Course, many factors which make
this kind of cultural event inaccessible to a white
audience. Country blues performers were otien shy,
iiniovened poet-guitar players, and regardless or
individual personalities the country blues are most
often intimate soliloquies, painful admissions in a
private dialogue between the artist's emotional and
artistic sensibilities. The best blues performances
are always improvised and spontaneous, the singer
choosing his theme and actually putting the song 10‘
gether on the spot, relying on his own inventive
abilities and falling back if necessary on the thou-
sands oi stanzas and phrases which are “common-
places" in blues lyrics. Then too, harsh voice, thick
accent, and a primitive and unpolished musical style
add to the problems bl a iai-mal presentation.

All too often there is a tendency to dismiss this
Negro music as an inevitable, but nevertheless un-
pleasant reminder of what this country has done to
its colored Citilens. This kind of attitude is doubly
gratuitous in that it ignores the artistic excellence
of these Negro singers at the same time that. it
crosses them off in hlswry us the unfortunate Vic—
tims of a regrettable cultural lag. The truth of the
matter is that the American South created the cir-
cumstances (or a remarkable variety at man, of
man driven to the physical and psychological hor-
ders of human endurance, and that from this re-
markable, historical voyage this manner of man
brought back a new version of human experience,
and was forced to invent — out of lllltel'acy Ind lg:
norance ——a new kind oi human art. that mu,
capable of telling about me terror of that trip.

Charlie Wu had his rovengel As I dizzily stared

(Continued from last issue.
at my buttonless shirts, I asked the nameless China<
man. “What happened?"
“So solly," he giggled, "Wild mongoose ﬂy in

He guilawedr

“Mongeese don’t even fly, you lazy punk,” I
snarled. “And each button Will cost you five more
pounds of free laundry." Now, it was my turn to
giggle.

“[ iigure you owe me 150 pounds of free laundry,
and ii 1 don’t get quicker service. I’ll have a court
injunction on you before you can say, ‘Mao Tse
Tung.’ ”

Charlie was impressed, and so were my friends
when I offered to have their laundry done for free.
They were not very impressed when all their shirts
came back without buttons. however.

But when I explained that for every button lost
live nee pounds oi laundering were gained, everyone
immediately shared my enthusiasm for such a good

deal.

At an average of 9 buttons per shirt and 20 shirts
per bag (we soon quit having extraneous apparel
such as underwear washed, since there was nothing
to he gained from anything but shirts), each bag
meant 900 more pounds or tree laundering

Within three weeks, all my acquaintances and
their acquaintances were having their shirts done
tree, for Charlie now owed me 73,745 pounds, and
the number was increasing every minute as he
washed and then vengefully derbuttoned shirt after
shirt.

Grudge Pot

Newspapers soon picked up the story, and people
on the street began to offer me the Shirts all their
backs. Young ladies hastening to work in only bras
sieres were not uncommon, for few people could
allozd to miss five free pounds of laundering.

Charlie Wu’s business was hooming so iantas
tlcally, in fact, that he had bought out all the other
laundries in Chicago to keep pace with the demand.
He reaped huge proiits hy reselling the cut-oil but<
tons (just as 1 sold the buttonless shirts) to shirt
manufacturers ior ridiculously inﬂated prices. Such
was the demand for shirts for de-buttoning.

Then, one day, the whole thing blew up in my
face. My ﬂeet of semis had picked up their daily
load oi bottomless shirts, when 1 opened the bags and
discovered all the Shirts in shreds, useless for resale.

I returned iniuriated to Charlie Wu's and met
the inevitable Chinaman.

“So soiiy,” he giggled again, and i knew the show
was over. “You notice each buttun still on shirt. Very
careful, this time. So soiiy hout nasty rips, but no
iree laullry for tilat. No free lautiry for dirty Ger
man fascist.”

The stock market crash of 1925 was like a truck
driver’s forgetting to leave a tip in comparison with
the results oi the Chlilaman's iiendish prank. Every«
one wanted their shirts back. hut only rags were ieit.

I sold rangs on street corners and wore rags eV<
erywhere. Girls no longer walked only in brassieres,
and the high neckline was in vogue. Charlie Wu lept
from the top of the Tribune Tower, screaming,
“Dirty capitalist!"

Tragedy filled the air like soot in a steel town,
and the nameless Chinaman only laughed,

By JOHN WOLF
JEAN VANDERVOORT
JOHN PHILLIPS

We went to Des Moines last Fri-
day not knowing too much about
poverty conditions in Iowa’s capi»
tat. other than the {act that there
weie major “modest” areas.

The southeast “Bottoms" area
was mh‘ immediate target. This
section lies about a mile trom the
nculy gilded capitol dome, which

THE FIRST WOMAN we ialked to

is a prominent feature to the north
ol‘ the Slums, In theory, this is the
worst slum area, and for some
reason has so far been passed up
in Des Moines' urban renewal
plans.

The residents of the district are
well integrated—7o per cent white.
25 per cent Negro, and 5 per cent
Mexican. They aren't crowded,
either; the area has a rural, al-
most appealing (at least on a
warm fall day), appearance it you
ignore certain unpleasant aspects.

our approach to learning about
the Bottoms area was [0 walh’

"All my children were born and

without much concern.

Bath her daughters lived up the

. cntly were among the old la-
dies pleasures in life. she had
Halloween decorations, made zit
school by her grandchildren, pasted
on the windows of her home —
probably among the beslrkept
houses in the neighborhood.

 

The neighborhood on a whole is
quite unlike the pleasant houses
that surround our college. About
90 per cent of the homes don't
have complete plumbing facilities.
Consequently, otithotises, and de-
crepit ones at that, add their una

over broken machinery and other
junk scattered thrnugh the area.

But the old Mexican woman
didn't complain about her condi-
tions. In fact, she claimed, "1 am
happy." Happy despite her inabil-
ity to communicate easily With
her neighbors, who included Nee
groes, Italians, and a group which
the woman simply called “Amen
icons." No one nearby spoke her
native Spanish, not
daughters. _

Her activities consisted of going
to church once a wcclt, going
downtown occasionally to eat at a
dlmestore, and visiting her husA
band's git a. With little more
than a tinge oi grief, she said,
“The cemetery is my life."

Her husband had worked in thc'

nearbytmilroad freight yards. She
now lived on social security and
other benefits.

As we were about to leave, the
lady wondered why they didn’t fix
the place tip. and she pointed to
the unpaved streets and two anr
cieni houses that were fallng a
part across the street. She thought
maybe the area was being re-
served tor a factory sometime in
the future. Why pave the streets

We wandered toward a factory
that makes the little travel bags
you get trom some airlines. Just
behind the plant we saw an old
Negro woman working in her yard
which was the site or a typical
area hnmckadded to piecemeal
over the years. erratically paint-

beiore we got to the house, so we
went to the back door and
knocked. In the back was a pump,
on Outhouse, and a small coop
for chickens.

The woman, dressed in denim
Coveralls and a wide»brimmed hat,
answered our knock and talked
rettccntly tor awhile from behind
her screen door, and then stepped
outside to answer our queries.

The woman surprised us when
she noted that she was 72 years
old. She had lived on the property
she now occupies (or 35 years,
she said.

The IOWA CAPITOL is only a mile away train the Bot,
rains district, where you can ﬁnd wooded areas — and
ouihnuses near home: without plumbing.

Now, however, her property had
become destrable. The flight-bag
tactory wanted it for expansion,
“and ii they otter me enough I'll
let them have it."

She didn‘t have any idea where
she would move II she sold her
land, but she said he had lots
of relatives on the west side of
Des Moines.

Her parents came from Virgin»
la, but she was born in Iowa.
Her family moved to Des Moincs
in 1917, and her father started the
Cafeteria in the IDwa Slate House.

We were impressed by her in-
telligence and again were stir-
prised to learn she had gotten no
further In her formal education
than one semester at East High
School ln Des MDines. Still, she
knew a lot about the natural his-
tory and geology of the area and
was well acquainted with the op

erotions of the flightrbag factory.

The old Negro woman made a
little money trom her chickens, but
her main support was from her
late husband‘s pension; he had
worked at the Burlington Railroad
roundhﬂuse.

We asked her if she got water
from the pump in h - yard. “The
pump doesn't wor was her re-
ply. “A neighbor up the road
brings me water. I use rain water

She was very proud oi the fact
that in her immediate family
“eight boys are in the service, and
we have five or siX_ nurses. I
don‘t know about the sixth one
because she’s only three months
old." '

Besides having survived the

herself several times from being

that she keep her back yard tree

she pulls them up and burns them

to Des Moines' poverty is the ex

One of the primary reasons that
employment is so important, Cash
said, was to "get the male eme
playable so he can assume the
role of head of the household.”

it was also pointed out by ale
most everyone that the public

built in Negro neighborhoods thus
maintaining the segregated hous-

The ills of this pattern of housing

“We're going for broke in
Chicago. This is a ﬁnal test for
the nonviolent approach," said
the Reverend Charles Billips, the
top aide to names Bevel, the lead
er of the Southern Christian Lead-
ei‘ship Conference in Chicago.

The SCLC, which is Dr. Martin
Luther King’s organization, has
moved into Chicago in iorce. Many

ing, planning, studying.

The goal Of the SCLC in Chi-
cago is a Federal Fair Housing
Act with subsidies. How they will
get this act is the question. As
Billips said, “If non-Violence does-
n't succeed, theii Violence wills"

Another SCLC Worker that we
met in Selina, James Orange,
said he was organizing the street
gangs, the teenagers. Orange said
the reason he was organizing the
gangs was that the “girls did all
the participating in the South but
up here we’re trying to get to the

There was some difference of
opinion about the police in Chi-
cago. Blllips said they were
“okay.” Orange said that Jim
Clark (Selma's sheriff) is “sweet
compared to the police up here.”
Orange went on to say that the
difference in attitude was that in
the South the police weren’t as
mercenary. The job of the north-
ei-n policeman, contended Orange,
is to “harass poor people and keep
them scared."

Cash With the CCUO had an
opinion about the police too. He
said that the police in Chicago
have a “different attitude” than
those in the Smith. “There is no
mass mistreatment," he asserted.
“They are fmr and don’t take ad-
vantage of the people You don’t
have the brutal policeman here.”

Indications were that demon-
strations iii a really big way
wouldn’t start for about a year—
say, next summer for example.

Billips stressed the importance
of getting the movement back in
the church. “The churches," said
Billlps, “could he strong here."

“In Chicago,” he continued,
“the white churches will help.

Chicago's De Patio Segregated School System
Presents Difficulties to Poverty Programs

The schools in Chicago were the topic of
controversy, marches, and sit-ins this slim-
mer. The Negro organizations claim that
schools superintendent Benjamin Willis has
created a system of “de facto segregation"
by using what is called the “neighborhood
school system” policy. The policy in essence
says that you go to the school that is nearest
you. On the West. Side this means the 95 pet‘
cent of the children in the schools are Nee

gm, According to the demonstrators this
summer Willis has placed new schools in

 

SllCh'a manner as to continue this system.
The all Negro schools are wrought ’with

many problems - not the least oi which is
keeping good teachers. A teacher can, after
three years tenure, request and get a trans-
fer to another school. What this often means
is that only the new, inexperienced teachers
are sent to the Negro schools and, as soon
as they gain any experience, they transleix

Of course there are other problems inher-
ent with an all Negro school. The lack of
contact between white and Negro students
continues a kind of mutual ignorance of one
another. Arid, as the US, Supreme Court
realized in 1954, the psychological effect of

being segregated makes it impossible to get

' an’ equal 'educ'ation’. '

A small town has no slums.
Most or the streets are paved, and
lighted, through all or the incor-
porated area. Grinneil's houses
have yards, and lawns, and TV
antennas. Must streets have side-
walks.

There are, however, unpainted,

haven’t come. Most of them are
slowly being ruined: some by
time, some by vandals. and some
systematically, board by sal-
vageable board,

a fall atternoon, knocking on doors
of houses you wouldn’t want to

interesting ideas, and people. Our

“lolded up, to let the rest of the
world go by,” in Grinnell. He told
us of the days when he, too, wore
a beard, and sailed with the mer-
chant marines, ran a woodwork-
ing shop, collected ,and polished
gemstones and mineral samples
for sale, and prospeeted through
the west tor gold and silver. We
talked of politics. “I’m an inde-
pendent; I vote for the man," and
his first years in Grinnell, when
he was still working as a small
contractor. He assured us several
times, almost wisttutly, that his
health was getting better again.
and soon he would be back at
work. Meanwhile, what does he
live on? “I know the right people;
that's what counts,” was the only
answer he'd give.

Our friend talked to us of col-
lege a lot, that attemoon when
all or us were playing hookey
from Burling. He’d gone to a jun-
ior college in Fort Dodge, until he
“Get smart and left," because,
really, "What counted was the
money." Yet he assured us again
and again as we tool: his picture

up and go with it." Then we left,
and he went back inside his little
house, to wait who knows how
long until someone else from the
rest of the world would stop as
they go by.

Atter this auspicious, and time-
consuming beginning, the project
began to get more difficult. We
were ill-ai-ease knocking on pear
ple's tloors, and they were unce
tom of what we wanted and
whether or not they trusted us.
Few were hostile,
them bhvtously felt that they had

luothiiig unusual or interesting to

utter us.

Most of the people we talked to
were old, and usually ill. One man
told us of working in the glove
factory for 40 years, until retiring
seven years ago. He and his with

pension from the factory. His come

tionnl scale or on north cam us,
the ﬁrst thing that must be one
is to define t a problem, It is ne-

problem is."

We agree, It is in In Iﬂempt to

define the problem of the prO‘
gosed change of the north campus
all system that we would like
Someone (myone) in the adminis-
tration to answer some questions
that have occurred to us:

1. What attempts have been
made to define the “North
Cam us Problem.” and what
cont: usions have b e e n
reached?

2. Who has been involved in
the discussions to date?

I. What action has been tat-ten
and what decisions have lil-
ready been made by the ad-
ministration?

. \Vhat alternatives have been
proposed and which are most

under consideration?

5. Will [he men of north camp“!
be able to choose in a reier-
endum tram among the pro:
jnosed alternatives, including

eeping the present system.

We don't suggest that this is «no
best of all. possible worlds. but w
do speak as Grinnell students \vh
are pleued with the hall system
as it exists today. It there is n be
ter system. we want to be I run
of it. but we have the feeling ml
we haven’t been consulted Ibou
the proposed chin as. We thin
we ought to he, an . indeed, hav

An answer from somebody in

Crosseti Investigates Complaints
About Unreal Nature of Grinnell

To the Editor:

In the last issue oi the son an»
pedr two expressions of a notion
so common among undergraduates
Hand their parents — as to ha
of some importance. Both writers,
l\1r. Roberts and Miss Brusl, echo
the facile complaint that life on
the Grinnell campus is not “real".
The charge is an easy echo of the
ramiliar phrase, “When you get out
into the real world . .

1 think that the notion needs
looking into. it has both truth
and talsity in it, as do most coin-
inon notions; perhaps analysis will
reveal. if not the percentage ot
each, at least hat the truth and
ialseness are. i easons tor think»
ing such analysis important at this
time are more complex than 1
cm! go into here, where space is,
i am told, at a premium, and so
i siiall hope that perceptive read
cis will be able to deduce the
critical circumstances [hilt Im-
pclled me to such a letter now.

First, one must admit that lite
here is as real as it is anywhere
else uhere people congregate,
whether that place be a club, a Jail,
an asylum, a party, a hospital, a
congress, or any other institution.
The passions exist here — Jealousy,
love, hate, fear; the business of lite
exists here—~Vvurk, plot, caucus,
struggle for power. The stakes are
not generally so high as in “real"
lite, as a role, we do not die when
we tail, nor are we in positions to
lntiict death when we win, But
for this “defect" we may he grate
rul. Anyone who knows anything
about life on a college campus,
among faculty, students, or even
the administration, knows that
melodramas and tragedies as well
as iarces and comedies are to be
round everywhere; and so are the

lotless improvisations that pass
or drama in the modern theater.

Complains, then, about the un-
reality of l at college are inace
curate; living people inhabit and
manage colleges, and that iact a.
lone miarantees the reality or lite
here.

There is, however, some tiuth
to the charge that lira here is un-
real. And for this, too, we may be

ratetut 1r college were exactly
ike socalled ”real" lite. it could
not do its ioh. As it is a real job,
i suppose that it is real life, too.
Yet this real job is to make life
unreal. Unless students cooperate
—for college is a voluntary activia
ty‘the job cannot he done. So
students must be willing. ior four-
years, to engage in lives of deli-
berate and calculated unreality, A»
long with the faculty, and even
the administration, they must fore-

 

go as much of "real" life as they
can; they must delimit their pas-
sions and speak with an honesty
which the so-called ”i‘eal'Y world
cannot hear. Yet we must not con~
temn the “real" world, for it has
built the garden and. tower that we
call a college. It. has enabled stu-
dents and teachers to withdraw
into it for {our years—the four
most formative years of the mind’s
life—so that all of reality, ranging
from fantasy to brutality, can be
examined critically, dispassicllale-
1y, analytically. The “real” World
has stocked this gardell-culn-towel‘
with great libraries and with arms
able and cultivated men, though
on this last point we must allow
for the degree of “real” \vorldliness
present even in faculty members.
Students are supposed to live, at
their own accord. ill the garden
and to abide by the rules of its na-
ture. oiily it tl y do can they ever
ground their pl losophies and their
knowlctlgeo firmly enough to move
into and manage the “realH World
successfully.

If they refuse, if they are off
picketing, ig to topple govern-
ments, bui ing oli-art cards, male
ing snide remarks, engaging in for»
nication, vandalism, di’ugraddictioﬂ,
alcoholism, laziness, they will find,
when they reach the real "real”
World, that they are woefully uur
prepared for it. The college is a
reality in the midst of the “real”
world and it must be met realisti-
cally. Students who snipe at its
unreality siinply railto face up to
reality.

Sergeant in l Viet Nam Criticizes ,
Student Protest Demonstrations

To the Editor:

Enclosed you will find a reprint
from one of ,the USAF newspap-
ers from Southeast Asia. I believe
this editorial excellently expresses
the attitude or many men serving
in the military. it provides a little
food for thought and i am in hopes
that you might publish it in a
torthcoming edition oi the son.

As a member of the Class of ’62,
i am well aware or many of the
student and iaculty opinions re
garding dis moment, etc. Some
or the more idealistic Griuncllians
were pieketing the Military Ball,
lasting for peace, and mounting
other protests back in 1960, so I
assume there might be suﬂictent
interest, pro and con, to warrant
this article being printed on your
editorial page,

1 shall refrain rrom oditoriallzing,
on my own, though many of the
entrant demonstrations and man
practices we read about every day
both disappoint and disgust us i
will sideuith Sergeant Gianulsos
and hope you will see in in present
it to the student body.

THE COLLEGIATE FRINGE

This editorlal was written by
T/Sgt. Peter Gt Gianutsos, editor
of the Advisor, the newspapei of
the Air Force’s Second Air D '
sion at Tan 5011 Nhut Air Field in
Viet Nam.

Time was when a boy went to
college to study law, medicine, en-
gineering, or one of the arts. And
girls went to get' their Mrs. degree,
But lul‘ too many, it is not that Way
any more. Today's crop at college
nut-ups are no longer content to
swallow gold fish, crowd them-
selves into telephone booths or
small foreign cars. They — and we
reler to the minority that makes
the majority of the voice — now
insist on dictating government poli-
cies, and are ready to parade, dem~
onstrate and sitrin at the drop of
a cause.

The latest gimmick among these
intellectual midgets is a campéign
to urge all members of the armed
forces to desert their posts, rather
than serve in Viet Nam.

AS a member of the race that
started this democracy kick,
(Quick. Socrates, the Hemlock) I
have no quarrel with the right of
the individual to voice his opinion,
However, the hysterical babbling
of these bourgeois bores borders
on sedition, if not treason. I leave
that. to the legal eagles in the JusA
tlce Department. It is a sad day in-
deed when the words honor, duty
and country have come to mean so
little. As a member of the military
Iamily, I have spent the better part
of my adult. lite in the Saigons of
the world. it never occurred to me
to disobey an order, or to question
the right of my government to
send me anywhere to protect and
preserve its interests.

_Like a lot of us here in Viet
Nam. I have had occasion to he at
the base theater during one of the
drilly memorial services, and I
have seen the Slow walking and

heard somber music and soft pray-
er for those to whom rotation dates
are no longer impumnt. l mutte‘-
ed my own prayer, as well as giv-
ing silent: thanks that it was not
me inside that metal box.

As I stood there, I remembered
preachings of mese mentally re-
tarded adulLs. and my compassion
tor a dead man turned to shame,
and then anger that they dared to
ask me to prostitute my profession
ask me to bring dishonor to in
self, to my service and to my coun-
ry.

It is difficult enough to under
stand when the supposed learned
citizenry take the rostrum to rant
and rave against our government,
and thereby feed the propaganda
mills to the north, but to be sub-
jected to the meaningless chatter
of these inlbccilic sloths, whose
idea of bravery is to lead a panty
raid on a gil‘ls‘ barracks, is more
than human dignity can bear.

It has been suggested that they
all be drafted into the service and
brought to Viet Nam. I could not
agree less. To put these morons
in a uniform is to insult the mertr
ory of those who never came back
from Guadalcanal or Pork Chop
Hill, or those who did not survive
the bombing of the Brinks Hotel
or the American Embassy here.

Instead, clean them u , cut their
hair, and take away tieir sweat:

 

shirts and sneakers and bring
them to Viet Nam to live among
the people. Let them expound their
theories about the good, the kind,
the misunderstood Viet Cong a-
mong the villagers whose homes
were destroyed and their meager
rice stolen.

Let them talk about war mon-
gering to the widow of a Vietnanr
ese army private, who earns her
fish and rice as a prostitute, or
with the village woman, who lost
a hand, one finger at a time and
finally the wrist to these kind. nus-
understood Viet Cong because she
dared to stand up for what she bo-
lieved was right.

Draft them into the military?
Never! Ours is a proud organizae
tion, made up of men and women,
who have ideals and principles,
and what’s even more important,
men and women who have the
courage and the will to live up to
those beliefs.

They take great pride in them-
selves, iii their uniforms, and in
their nation, qualities that the
campus “cuties" have yet to ace
quire, Until they do, they will
never “belong," The ~ voice will
he that of the scnlireducated, the
fool who will leave behind only a
legacy of shame, dishonor and EA
noraiice.

DuPont Researcher Explains Advances

ucts made possible by the new
liber technology,

The chemists laced a problem
when they discovered that a fiber
which was beautifully constructed
from I chemical point would not
take a dye, Mordants were devel-
oped which were responsive to
only certain types at dye: thus it
was possible by alternating dit-
Ierently mordanted Iibﬂs in the
weaving process. to put a white
iabric into a dye bath and pull
out a striped flag. This same pro
cess is used in making heather
sweaters.

As Hicks presented the ﬁeld, all
sorrs of people seem to beneﬁt
from the synthetic ﬁbers, Girls
wanting to preserve their houiiant
sweaters can step into their lycra~
spun turtlenecks. Astronauts. an
sons, and Buddhist nionks may
wish to consider the advantages
of DuPont's lireprool suits.

The next meeting of the chemi-
Cal society will be Tuesday. Nov.

Pioneer Gridders Beat lawrence

After Defeat At Ham/s OI Belait

The Pioneer football team
Bounced back last weekend, after
28-0 loss to Beloit two weeks ago,
squeak by Lawrence 1846 and
ove into a second place tie with
loit and Lawrence in the con-
erence \vith a 472 record. Jelf
rantz grabbed an aerial from
,arry Anderson in the last quar-
r at Lawrence to give the Pio-
eers the victory. Then the defense
ant to work and stopped three
awrence thrusts in the final quar-
r to preserve the victory.
At Beloit the gridmen ran into a
am that was nearly unbeatable
n the particular afternoon. The
uccaneers played near perfect

[ball in rolling up 432 yards While

holding the Pioneers to a meager
Ill. The big part of the Eeloit of»
fense was passing. They completed
24 of 40 passes for 348 yards.

Scoreless First Quarter

The first quarter was scoreless
but on the first play of the second
quarter the Bucs scored on a two
yard plunge after recovering a
tumble on the eight, Later in the
quarter they drove 56 yards, helped
by a pass interference penalty, for
the second score. They picked up

produced the ﬁnal score of the
game,

But against Lawrence the Pio-
neers got their oifense back in gear
and ground out 338 yards. Leading
rushers in the game were Bob
Watt and Dick Lamb with 84 and
59 yards respectively.

Also in this game Barry Ander-
son set three Pioneer career pass-
ing records. His 245 attempts, 121
completions and 1223 yards all
eclipsed the old standards.

The Pioneers started out at
Lawrence like they were going to
have another bad afternoon. The
first two times they got the ball
they fumbled once and had a pass
intercepted the other time. The
first time the Pioneer defense held,
but on the interception the Viking
back gave the defense no chance
as he went 58 yards to score.

Pioneers Roll

The third time they got the ball
though the Pioneers got their of-
fense rolling. Relyingl-leavily on
the running of Lamb and John
Shierholz, the Pioneers drove 73
yards for a touchdown. But an in-
complete pass after a fake place-
ment on the extra point left the
Pioneers down 7-6. But they quick-
ly drove in for another score. Tom
Lannom recovered a fumble on the
Lawrence 37 to set up the drive.
The score came by Watt’s loyard
scamper.

The Vikings came back and
scored on a 54-yard pass, that was
barely missed by the pioneer de-
fender. Then after they picked off
an errant pass, the Vikings scored
a field goal to take a 16-12 half-
time lead.

Wlnning Score

After a scoreless third quarter,
the Frantz—Anderson combination
got together on a ten yard pass for
the Winning score. The defense
th e it stopped three Lawrence
thrusts, The first one was stopped
when Lawrence missed a field
goal from the 35, The second was
halted by an interception, and the
third was checked on downs.

The Pioneers will end ﬁre season
with two home games — Coe and
Carleton. Tomorrow the Kohawks
will invade Grilmell fresh from two
consecutive wins over Cornell and
Knox. Coe was also victorious over
the Pioneers last year 21-15.

Dibble Gives Up No Poinl'sr_
Takes IM Football Crown.

By ELLIOTT HIBBS

It was back on November 16,
1957, that Bud Wilkinson’s Okla-
homa Sooner: entertained the
“fighting irish" of Notre name
at Norman, Oklahoma. The 0k-
lahomans were riding a record
streak of 47 consecutive triumphs,
Notre Dame, on the other hand.
was rebounding from its worst
season in history. Moreover, 0k-
lahoma had not been shut—out in
123 straight contests. The “fight-
ing lrishmen," noted for their
ability to win big games, rose to
the occasion and fashioned a tough
7-0 win over the Sooners, and re-
bounded to a 7-3 record and back
into football's elite.

Clark Hall was never quite as
powerful as the Sooners, but they
threatened to establish a streak of
unbeaten games which was close
to Wilkinson’s fabulous record,
They had gone through three sea<
sons Without a defeat, a couple
of ties the only mars on their rec-
0rd. But, as 1965 rUIIEd around,
Mike Stuart (the Bud Wilkinson of
Clark Hall) found himself with an
untried crop of rookies with very
few veterans. They began the sea-
son by dumping South, is con-
tender in pre-Season talk, 13c,
Then their luck ran out as Gates
and Cowles each won close games.

Oklahoma went on to post a
9-1 record in 1957, but Clark real-
ly fell posting a lowly 451 record
which tied for eighth in the final
standings. With the rest of the
league looking tougher, it looks as
If Clark might see a lot of the
lower half of the TM ,iootball
standings.

In case you didn't hear, nibble
won the season quite handily scor-

 

 

ing 152 points and allowing none.
Dibble might have some thoughts
about starting a streak, but its
losing a few of its big boys and
a few halls will be wanting a
crack at them next year. It's my
guess they won't be undefeated
and unscored on next year,

Langan proved to be the most
futile team in the league, scoring
two touchdowns for 12 points and
giving up a whopping 280 points.
Their defense might have been
worse, but they managed to hold
Cowles to a 141 forfeit by not
showing up, It's my guess they
will be shooting to top that 280
next year,
