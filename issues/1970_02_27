Faculty Meeting

At last Monday’s faculty
meeting Dean Wall reported the
following statistics concerning
Studentrteacher ratios at Grin-
nell. In me years 1959-60 Grinnell
had so faculty members and 1,002
students the first semester and
962 students the second
semester; in the year 1965-66
there were 103 faculty members
and 1,155 students the first
semester and 1,101 students the
second semester; for the year
1969770 the iigures were 132
faculty and 1,144 and 1,107
students. Dean Wall pointed out
that the large increase in faculty
as compared to the increase in
students was unjustifiable ac-
cording to Grinnell's present
financial condition.

We 'mar Symposium Opens

By Steve Grow

On Tuesday evening Professor
Eric Kollman began the Sym-
posium on Weimar Culture with
a lecture, “Weimar Germany in
Historical Perspective.“
Professor Kollman, who is now
teaching at Cornell College, grew
up in Austria during the Weimar
Republic. A Jew, he came to Iowa
thirty years ago to escape from
Hitler.

Professor Kollman once
thought that the Weimar
Republic was born too late ill
Germany’s history; now he
thinks it was born too early. in
1947 Kollman prophesied that the
new German Republic would
have as little chance of survival
as the Weimar Republic, because

Professor Kollmzn spoke to a large crowd in

conditions in Germany after the
second World War were worse
than after the first, and those
conditions had handicapped the
Weimar Republic from its
beginning,

Germany had not faced its
defeat after World War I. Its
people had not expected collapse
of the army, and the Versailles
Treaty was called an “ar-
mistice" when it should have
been called an “unconditional
surrender." So the German
pcople retained the illusion that
they had not been defeated in
battle. From the start the
Republic was hated by those who
thought the harsh terms of the
Versailles Treaty unjust, which

included nearly everyone in
Germany. The Republic itself
was said (falsely) to have been
responsible for the “stab in the
back" at Versailles.

The government never had
control over the army. In fact,
the army became an independent
right wing force opposed to the
democracy. Kollman Cited the
failure to disband the army alter
the war and to build a new
democratic military force as a
mistake.

Germany was also confronted
with a split in her working class.
No one took it too seriously at
the time, expecting that the split
would heal, but it did not heal.
The differences were too fun
damental. There were as many
political parties in Germany as
there were points of view, and
the coalition governments that
were formed were inept and
unstable, for the German
politicians did not believe in
compromise. During the whole ol
the Weimar Republic no great
leader got the power in Germany.

Professor Kollman was quick
to add that conditions in Weimar
Germany were not unique, since
other European countries had
suffered great damage and
manpower loss during the war.
The great depression, which
caused “nightmarish inflation"
in Germany, also affected Britain
and the United States, but the
Weimar Republic was unable to
meet the crisis.

Kollman would not compare
Germany of 1913 to Russia at
1917, but instead to France in
1370. There had been a military
defeat, there was little one
thusiasm for the Republic, there
had been territorial losses, and
there were many radical political
groups. There were, however,
some differences: The Franco-
Prusslan War was a short one
and had not done nearly so much
damage. France had a
revolutionary tradition, whereas
Germany did not, The French
Third Republic had had time to
recover from the war; Germany
was hit by the depression almost
immediately.

What is the place of the Weimar
Republic in German history?
Was it merely a prelude to
Hitler” Kollman maintained that
Hitler’s rise was not inevitable.
There were many turning points
during the Republic when the
course of German history could
have been changed: for example,
a democratic army could have
been formed.

The Weimar Republic was a
very creative period for Ger-
many, as German scientists and
artists made great contributions
to [he world. Professor Kollman

1 Nebraska Conservation Professor
Gives Lectures Here on Ecology

Dr. James Drew of the
University of Nebraska spoke on
ecology here Wednesday. He
gave two lectures, one to over
200 students including the Science
1 class, and held a question and
answer session.

The first lecture, “Ecological
Implications of the Alaskan Oil
Development," never got deeply
into the subject before the period
ended. Drew has spent some time
in the Arctic slope region of
northern Alaska where oil has
recently been discovered.
Problems caused by permafrost
and earth slippages which
prevent die construction of roads
and pipelines were discussed at
length.

”infrared Sensing of Soil and
Range Conditions" was the topic
of Drew’s second lecture, which
was attended mostly by faculty
members. This concerned a
study he did in the sandhiils of
Nebraska, an undeveloped region
used fuzing. Remote sensing
techniques (aerial infrared
photography,) were used to map

pointed out that although these
men produced much during the
Twenties, the seeds of their
creativity had‘ been planted
earlier, Lowered restrictions
under the Weimar regime
allowed much profitable ex-
perimentation in the arts.

Koliman does not accept the
comparison of Germany of 1930
to America of 1970. There are
important differences: Vietnam
is a limited war, and Americans
were divided at its beginning;
America is basically a none
military society.

The second event in the
Symposium was a lecture—
discussion by Professor Henry
Klein of the Grinnell Art faculty
about Seigfried Kracauer’s book
From Caligari to Hitler. Despite

the soil types of this area, Certain
plant types grow only in certain
soils, These differences show up
through varied coloration an
infrared film. Boundaries thus
are clear unless man has altered
the vegetation patterns. This
technique, though expensive, can
be used to detect plant diseases,
such as Dutch Elm, long before
they show up normally. When
detected early enough, measures
can be taken to prevent spread
of the disease.

When asked about pollution,
Dr. Drew said that he is in
terested with the “basic aspects
of pollution rather than
developing specific technical
solutions to the problem. I mink
that we need to look at the basic
things first than to develop
technical solutions.”

Dr. Drew received his doc-
torate from Rutgers University.
He is currently teaching con-
servation courses at the
University of Nebraska, where he
is also advisor to the con-
servation majors,

political forces in Germany
which might have prevented the
rise of Fascism, like the left wing
and the intellectuals, Hitler did
eventually become Chancellor.

Kracauer’s book is one attemp
to explain why. In German films
of the period one can see certain
themes and motifs, which;
judging by their box office suc-
cess, were geared toward a set
of appetites in the German
people. By analyzing those films
which were popular and those
which were not, Kracauer ex—
posed some traits of the Germans
which made Hitler’s rise
possible.

The most striking charac-
teristic of the German cinema
was me way in which the
material was edited. The human
content of the shots was often
displaced by a visual motif, like
movement or texture, which gave
a rather detached View of human

Nationwide Teach-In Begins Next Month
To Discuss The Problems of Pollution

Plans are now well underway
for a nationwide Teachrln next
spring, April 22, on his grave
crisis facing the quality of the
environment and the quality of
life in America today.

A national headquarters and
staff to organize, coordinate and
service this effort are now
established in Washington. The
address is Room 500, 2100 “M”
Street, N. w., Washington, D. c.
20037.

The aim of the National Teach-
In is to encourage students across
the country to take the initiative
in organizing April 22 environ-
mental teach-ins on their cam-
puses and associated efforts in
their communities.

Successful teach~ins on all
campuses on the same day will
have a dramatic impact on the
environmental conscience of the
nation. They will be immensely
effective as an educational effort
in arousing public opinion con—
cerning necessary steps to
protect our environment and
establish quality on a par with

life. Klein pointed out that
similar material could have been
edited in a way that emphasized
the underlying humanity. The

, popular German films — Klein

cited “Berlin, Symphony of a
City” as an example — treated
people as formal objects, so
although shots of real people in
real situations were often used
in place of scenes staged by
actors, the films avoided a
confrontation with humanity. The
emphasis was on decorative
patterns, not individuality. In the
wartime films “real Soldiers and
tanks fighting at the front
somehow became cardboard
because of the way the pictures
wereedited,"saidl(lein.

American and British wartime
films seemed to be most in-
terested in identifying a real
person and confronting his in-

quantity as a goal of American
life.

There is no question that in the
long run, the environmental
challenge is me greatest faced
by mankind. Distinguished
scientific authorities have'bcen
warning for years that mankind
is rapidly destroying the very
habitat on which he depends for
his survival. In addition,
population continues to increase
worldwide, while scientists warn
that we may have already passed
sustainable population levels. All
across the country and worldwide
increasing numbers of citizens
are voicing the same intense
concern as has been so eloquently
expressed by ecologists and other
environmentalists.

Yet many are still not aware
of the environmental problems
being created by our advancing
technologyr Federally financed
projects, such as the supersonic
transport plane, raise grave
questions about possible new
environmental dangers. Many
respected scientists and national
leaders have indicated that
although some positive steps
have been taken, toxic and
persistent pesticides are still
accumulating in the world en-
vironment, wreaking destruction
,on fish and wildlife and
threatening man himself. Is the
price we pay for these products
in terms of their effect upon our
environment worth the benefits
we obtain from them?

The pollution of our rivers and
lakes and of the air in our urban
areas Continues to accelerate.
Suburban sprawl continues to
destroy vast scenic and
recreational resources, Withlittle
heed being given to plans to
create workable environments.
The millions trapped in our urban
and rural ghettos continue to

suffer the worst of the massive.

air, water, land and noise
pollution.

Who will finally bear the brunt
of this tragic irresponsibility?
The generation now in school, the
generation which will soon
inherit the world environment.
The time has come for all citizens
to begin drinking about the basic
questions raised by technological
advances and environmental
degradation,

Students in America and the
world, deeply concerned with the
hard choices which their
generation faces, are uniquely
well suited to taking initiatives
in exploring with all citizens the
problems created by man’s

growing impact upon his en-

Vironment.

The National Teach-In next
April 22 provides students with
the opportunity to accomplish
this objective. Hundreds of [each

ins on that day would bring'

together for the first time on a
national scale the many young
people who are already con-
cerned about the environment
and would involve and educate
many more as well.

In addition to bringing this
widespread involvement. the
teachrins would present in-
formation, draw the issues,
stimulate plans for action, and

demonstrate the strength of
concern for a livable world.

Furthermore, the en
vironmental teachrins present an
unprecedented opportunity for
the involvement by student
initiative of communities,
organizations, leaders and
Concerned citizens of all
generations in a common non-
partisan effort to meet a problem
of far»reaching con-
sequence. Thus, it is urged that
all campuses in America par-
ticipate in a broadly based teach-
in effort involving all individuals
and groups who share this con»
cern.

Already the student response
to this idea has been one of
overwhelming support, and a
number of campuses are now
well into the process of planning
an April 22nd teach»in.

At the University of Michigan
:1 mass meeting was called
recently by an ad hoc student
committee to plan a teach-in.
More than 350 people attended
and the plan is now Well un—
derway. University officials and
faculty were also contacted for

.their support and advice, a step

which is important for a suc-
cessful teach-in,

One of the projects now being
planned preparatory to the
University of Michigan event is
a comprehensive inventory of
environmental problems in that
community and region.

Similar inventories around the
country would be educational and
practical and would provide the
teach-in with specific examples
of local environmental problems
needing immediate attention.

if young people put their
energy. imagination and
idealism to work on this issue,
they will help write a bright new
chapter in the struggle for a
livableworld.

Dear President Leggett:

We appreciated receiving your

climate at Grinnell. Our son
entered the college as a freshman

her. After the October weekend,
I am afraid we were rather dis-
lnaycd over the ominous note
struck concerning the dangers to
Grinnell and other Liberal Arts
colleges in the country it such
an emotional climate Continues.

We have always regarded our
selves as having liberal attitudes.
As a medlcal doctor, I am vitally

encompassing Vietnam politics,

demands, student power con-
cepts and positive benefits oi

approaches to discussion were
either being ignored or not
taught.

The weekend did not demon-
stralc a permissive or even

part oi students. faculty. or

administration toward the “vocal
minority", but rather it smacked
of a situation rapidly getting
beyond the control of authority.

We were invited to symposia
on various subjects where I ex-
pected discussio ' instead, it was
again a onersided solnetimes
emotional, often illogical, propa-
gandistic effort at persuasion. I
recall the days especially after
the propaganda nightmare of
World War II when this type oi
approach was considered
bcncath contempt, and yet we
were being asked to treat this
sort of appeal with respect. On
a subject as controversial as drug
use, there were three pro-drug
discussants and a faculty
member who admitted that the
Administration did not know how
to cope with the problem. Are
there no learned people in the
Grinnell College setting who
might have presented anti-drug
considerations?

Even more frightening was the
feeling that although the more

‘Actioll Now’ To Meet Here

By Staff Writer

On Saturday March 7 tnext
weekend), those infamous Grinr
nell Republicans will be spon~
soring an Action Now Conierence
on campus in conjunction with
the College Republicans of Iowa,
the Republican State Central
Committee, and the Republican
National Committee. How could
this ignominious convolution oi
political gameplaying organiza-
tions provide anything more than
the run-of—therl'nill political ex-
perience? Perhaps the “Action
Now” will provide the answer.

, The Action Now program was

tion, originality, and excitement of its per:
formances in the past. The choreography on
only ﬁve of the numbers has been done by
Mrs. Voertman, and all the rest were choreo-
graphed by students. (Photo by Paul Doughty)

Grinnell?

It becomes more and more ap-
parent to us that the goal of the
radical students at Grinnell and
other colleges is the creation of
student controlled communes. If
the Administration continues to
take a laissez—laire attitude
except for the issue of violence,
and continues to accede to
student power demands, this goal
should be a iait accompli in the
very near future. Perhaps such
a college commune should be
tried. From recent remarks of
the President at Bennington
College. it would seem that this
institution is close to it. I think
it only falr, however, that if this
is the intent at Grinnell, parents
and alumni should be made

aware of it. We should have the

privilcge of deciding it we wish
our children to participate in this
type of experiment. ‘-

Believe me, we are not replying
to your letter with any attitude
at rancor. We realize the almost
impossible tightrope walking po-
sition you are in. We fully appre~
ciale that you are trying to
halldle a very difficult situation
fairly. We feel that college ad-
ministrators need help and that
is what we would like to offer.

first established by Elly Peter-
son, then Statc Chairman of
Michigan Republican Party, in
Detroit as a program intended
to make party headquarters in
that city lunctional and valuable
to the citizens during non~election
years.

Elly Peterson is now assistant
chairman of the Republican Na-
tional Committee and has taken
her experience and ideas to the
national level. As a result, Action
Now has become a iulltime com-
munity action effort encouraged
by the Republican Party.

College Republicans in Iowa
have picked up this concept plan
to institute it on Iowa college
campuses with co-ordination on
the statewide level. The confer-
ence on March 7 is designed to
help educate college Republicans
and anyone else interested in
Constructive problem solving and
organized community action.

The conference will include
panels on drugs, pollution, the
perspective of the black student,
and a summary ,and general
procedures panel with which to
close the day’s activities In—
cluded in the program will be
Elly Peterson, the Action Now
ideologue; Jack Criw‘ord,
special assistant for community
affairs to the Republican Na-
tional Chairman; and several
other people intimately con
nected with this community
action program on the national
level.

Either Governor Robert Ray
or Lt. Governor Jepsen will
moderate the general panel, and
Senator Jack Miller will speak
atlunch.

Other resource people will be:
Dr. Philip Levine of Drake
University, head of the govern
nor’s drug commission; and Max
Milo Mills, head of the governor's
Crime Commission. Both men
will participate on the drug
panel. L. B. Liddy, Secretary of
Agriculture, St. Representative
Andrew Varley, expert in Iowa's
pollution problems; and Earl
Jarvis of the govemor’s Cone
servation Commission will
participate in the panel on pollu-
lion.

Concerning the concept of
Action Now in Iowa, Phil Sasich
of Grinnell College, and Director
of Action Now for Iowa, stated:
“Let me emphasize that Action
Now is a non-ideological
program. It is, indeed, sponsored
by the Republican Party and
College Republicans of Iowa, but
it deremphastzes almost to ex»
clusion the traditional party
functions of voteegetting and
political gaming. Rather, it is a

project designed for participation
by all people, regardless of
political affiliation, and is
directed at solving or helping to
solve any community problem
regardless of its role in the party
policy structure, In sum, we hope
to tap the human resource with
the aim or bettering the human
condition in somesmall way.”
He then Commented on the
March 7th Conference itseli. “We
hope that by bringing together
resource people with expertise in
lields related to local projects
college students might under-
take, we can educate Conference
participants in the concepts and
possibilities of community action
programs, Thus. just as the
Action Now program is none
ideological, our Conference will
be directed toward education and
as non-political as possible."
Sasich also stressed that the
Conference is open to all students
and that he hopes Grinnell
students and their skepticism
about party politics will be evi~
dent enough to keep proceedings
nonrpolitical and in line with the
above-mentioned goals.

“The controller radioed, ‘Look,
I‘ve got a target for you.’ And
he dropped a marker on this nice
little town of maybe 2,500 people.
Lou, the flight leader, asked, ‘Did
anybody see that‘?’ and we both
said no. Nobody wanted to be the
first to go in. We asked the FM:
to mark the target again. Well,’
that was it, Lou went in first and
those bombs just walked down
the street, bouncing off the sides
of the buildings. Don hit one end
and I took the other. We knocked
down maybe 25 buildings . . .
There'd been a sweep through
there a few weeks before; it was
territory, as far as we knew,
secure.”

This was taken from an article
by an airline pilot, formerly a
navy pilot in Vietnam, which

zine, February, 1968.

The explosives used by the pilot

Thomas and the Senate

Last week, the Senate, in its bounteous liberality,
saw fit to give Tom Thomas a gift of $50. They did this
immediately after the Student Auditor had informed
them that they were flat broke. But let that pass. One
should be prepared to tighten one’s belt when such
a worthy solicitor appears. At ﬂ'le time, the Senate
simply gave Thomas the money without either requiring
him to produce evidence of need or requesting him
to report the net profit on his journalistic venture.

Two weeks have passed, and we may note several
interesting facts. Thomas’ paper has been a great
success: approximately 600 copies sold each week. At
25 cents a copy, this means that the gross take came
to about $300 (plus the $50 gift). Now Thomas has stated
that the cost of printing each issue was between $80
and $100. Adding expenses and incidentals to that,
Thomas estimated the cost of producing each issue
at about $125 or about $250 for both. That leaves Mr.
Thomas and friends with a net profit of about $100,
which makes them pretty successful capitalists indeed.

We hasten to note that we are not implying that
Mr. Thomas would keep that $50 for himself. No doubt
he will return it to the Senate. The interesting question
concerns how he will return the money.

It seems that Mr. Thomas still owes SGA a con-
siderable amount of money from a loan made to pay
for his published report on the Chicago riots. That
loan, still in part outstanding, was supposed to have
need paid last semester. Now when that loan is called
in, Thomas is in the interesting position of being able
to pay off the loan with the $50 gift the Senate gave

him. No matter how he chooses to pay off the loan,
the question may be raised as to why he does not return
the gift which, presumably, was given for a non-profit
making venture. At any rate, the Senate has, once
again, demonstrated its seemingly infinite capacity for
thoughtless and naive actions.

The SGA will hold its election for President next
Monday. More precisely, Romper Room is going to
have a new play leader. The gentlemen who are running
for this office are dismally alike in their views. They
speak of student power, activism (apparently a disease
of a malfunctioning pituitary gland), good counselling,
responsibility, revolution, etc. etc. etc. We may mention
that the theater of the absurd candidate, Mark Kass,
at least had the sense of shame to run under an assumed
name ~ Jim Panzee. The other candidates are Andy
Loewi, Phil Mears, and Frank Thomas.

We believe that the range of candidates is something
less than spectacular. The editors of the 5&3 have
been informed that their endorsement of one or another
of the candidates is the kiss of death for that candidate’s
political ambitions. Lest we be thought to be unduly
sadistic, we shall refrain from any real endorsement.
Rather, in the tradition of great liberals like Jefferson
and Madison, we counsel resistance. We encourage
the students to boycott this election.

We do not intend to impugn the characters of any
of the candidates. Nor do we believe that activism
is necessarily reprehensible, although we do believe
that irrational activism is loathsome. Now the present
SGA President apparently operates on the principle
that if you do nothing, you do nothing wrong. That
is not wholly bad principle. But alas, he does nothing
so poorly.

If we support one or another of the candidates
we are simply giving him a license to proceed in the
irresponsible and childish manner of the present Senate.
It seems that it would be wiser to show the ad
ministration, faculty, and the candidates themselves
that we would like something better than what we
presently have. An effective boycott would, we think,
demonstrate this.

Letters to the Editor . . .

To The Editors:

Carleton College, which
Grinneil prides itself in outrdoing
whenever it can, has six dorms
which are coeducational by
rooms.

Colorado College (the newest
member of the ACM Conference)
has abolished grades.

Coe College, where the ad-
ministration opted out
of responsibility in drug cases by
abdicating it to the police,
recently revamped its
curriculum, doing away with all
requirements,

Al Grlnnell College, “the
Harvard of the Midwest,” the
politics of the universxty says
don't rock the boat. . .don’t ex-
periment in curriculum. ,don’t
change the living system . ,don‘t
emphasize community coop~
eration in solving counseling
problems. Instead, say 7 change
the curriculum only when you
can prove without a doubt that
present courses are highly unr
desu'able and proposed changes
for superior. . .say, if people are
stupid enough to take drugs when
they don't even know what
they’re getting, they shouldn’t
ask the college to help them out.

What does it take to make a
college excellent? What does it
take to make Grinnell exciting?
Such a minute part of our time
here is spent in the scholarly
pursuits of academia. What,
then, becomes of the rest of that
time? One of the last voices in
the new admissions film said.

“Grinnell can be a beautiful
place," and yet you could almost
hear where the conditional clause
had been removed. If we would
be willing to experiment, ii we
would be willing to challenge
students, if we would be willing
lo respond to people's desire to
learn, then. . .“Grinnell can be
a beautiful place."

For instance, most freshman.

coming into a college situation,
expect a challenging academic
environment. They are ready to
explore their ideological whims,
anxious to find out who they are
and what they are becoming.
How do we capitalize on this?
By a freshman orientation of two
days, designed to [it the
newcomer into Grinnell's day-to-
day operation as quickly and
smoothly as possible? By a
Humanities course as rigid in
reading material as it is in its
application to the student’s
personal questions, which cenr
lel'ed around his life and his
society raise the most profound
questions that any discussion of
Humanities could raise?

We could do better at Grinnell.
II we expect to call ourselves a
lruly outstanding liberal arts
college and have the phrase
mean anything —— then we must
do better. And if the faculty who
control the instllulinn by virtue
of their corporation-like standing
of rank and experience will not
challenge themselves to attempt
change and experimentation,
perhaps students must The
tyranny of prerequisites,
sequence of courses, and the deaf
our to change have no place in
a college which has got to have
an impact in improving the
quality of higher education in
America.

Name Withheld By Request

Tn The Editors:

As an ismrless and neutral
human being, I wish to publicly
commend Mr. Alan Nasser and
Mr. John Crossett for their
contributions to the SM}. May
their sound logic, open min-

To The Editors;

Mr. Klein’s comments upon my
review of The Battle of Algiers
are well taken. it was not,
however, my intention to suggest
that the film provides a paradigm
for an American urban
revolution. My point was that a
member or the establishment
sources both here and abroad
(Time, the French government)
perceived the film to have
revolutionary potential. Whether
or not their perceptions were
justified was not my concern;
that they perceived the film in
the paranoid iashion they did
seems to me to he of some
sociological interest. The
lnispcrccptionsoftherulmgclass
are often as instructive as its
vcrldical perceptions. Never-
theless, my article \vns amr
biguous on this point, and 1 am
grateful to Mr. chin for the
clarification.

Mr, Crossell chose not to
examine a single one of my
substantive contentions. instead
he olicred an unprecedented and
venomous exercise in character
assassination. A public debate
between me and Mr. Crossett
would seem to be pointless, as
therc is no reason to think that
his public style would differ
significantly from his written.
The real tragedy of Crossett’s
letter lies Tn the irreparable
damage that its autobiographical
revelations have done to his
reputation and credibility among
students, faculty, and ad»
ministration. Requicscat in Pace.

SCARLET AND BLACK

By Tom Greenfield

I am grief stricken to report
that the Senate and the Board
of Publications are not getting
along very well. Frank Thomas
announced that he hild asked the
Publications Board to appear at
this week's meeting. but Mr
Pnrssiiicii. a spokesman in the
Board refused Frank said, how
ever, that Mr Parsslncll had
invited the Senate to attend any
one ottlie Board's meetings

Chairwoman Jane West sub-
mitted to the powers ot reason.
“We can't force them to come.
so maybe We should attend their
next meeting” Someone then
suggested that the Senate shoot
Terry l>arssinen, but this was re
jected immediately on the
grounds that the Senate cannot
afford to purchase a gun.

The Senate wants to talk to the
board about several financial
matters 7 the publication and
financial hassles with Montage
(Gary Giddins’ torthcoming
literary magazine), the seems
iiigly exorbitant SM} traveling
expenses to Newton, and the
possibility of retrieving any
surplus funds which the board
may have.

Tom Thomas reopened the
question about legal responv
sibility in the Senate’s allocation
of 50 dollars to “High and
Mighty,” Toni insisted that his
legal sources, w. H. Thomas and
Ralph Mattaz, disagreed with
Mr. Beerman’s statement, which
asserts that the college is respons
sihle tor the contents of the paper
if SGA funds are used to finance
it, When Frank Thomas
suggested that the Senate go
speak to Mr. Beerman, instead
of listening to second hand
reports, Penguin Dave took
serious objection. “He’s incred-
ibly slimey,” someone else

shouted that Mr. Beerman was
full of something, but I couldn't
qmtc make out what it was

Phil SﬂSICll raised a point [hill
nobody tit the meeting had
enough experience to judge the
merits of one legal opinion over
another. Bill Thomas dismissed
this argument as irrelevant,
“You can get any legal opinion
you want ityou look hard enough
I think Beerman's opinion is
spurious and I don't accept it.“

The furor halted when Chuck
Garman pointed out that there
is no need to worry about legal
problems. If the Senate were to
purchase an ad or buy a lifetime
subscription, all legal problems
would disappear. ‘

Frank Thomas announced the
names of the four candidates for
SGA Presxdent 7 Jim Panzee
(Mark Kass), Andy Loewi, Phil
Mears, and Frank Thomas. A
brief interchange followed be
tween Frank and this reporter.
Among the subjects commented
upon were inferior journalism on

of Frank’s mother.

Editorial

Reprinted From The New York Times

The seriousness of New York City’s drug abuse problem and
the utter inadequacy of the governmental response to it have been
demonstrated by a series of developments within the past several
days.

A 17-year-old Barnard College freshman died after inhaling an
overdose of heroin over the weekend. A 17-year-old Brooklyn boy,
an 18»year-old Bronx girl, and a “3-year-old Staten Island boy died
from drug abuse in the city‘s five boroughs last year.

Drug abuse has become more pervasive among the city’s very
young. A deeply addicted 12-yearold girl was found in a narcotics
daze last week and returned to her expensive East Side home. An
11-year-old girl was admitted into the privately run Odyssey Home
rehabilitation program, and an ll-yearmld boy was arrested with
his two companions. ages 13 and 15, on charges of selling heroin.

It is hard to understand why city officials tried for a time to block
the release of statistics sketching the vast dimensions of the drug
abuse problem, or why they have failed to launch a preventive or
rehabilitation program on the scope clearly required. They have,
instead, sought to close down the Bronx Odyssey House, the only
facility in me country devoted solely to the rehabilitation of teen-age
addicts. They summoned Dr. Judianne Densen-Gerber, director of
the program,iinto criminal court on charges of violating a building
code provision against overcrowding. She faces a jail term.

Neither the city nor the state has made available presently unused
buildings which could be turned into treatment centers to the Odyssey
program or to other private organizations trying desperately to fill
the void created by official inaction. Such action is urgently needed.
The city and state ought to launch educational programs on drugs
to reach youngsters in the lowest school grades. There are probably
100.000 heroin addicts in the city, an estimated one-fourth of them
teenagers. Additional thousands of other youngsters are ex
perimenting with heroin and other dangerous drugs. Preventive
programs require immediate launching. Rehabilitation centers need
to be opened quickly. The Federal Government should help underwrite
city and state efforts in these areas

Mayor Lindsay has so far remained strangely aloof. He provides
for new rehabilitation centers in his capital budget. Governor
Rockefeller recommends further study. For the state to propose
the treatment of 150 teenagers in a pilot project that might get under
way in six months, as Assembly Speaker Duryea proposed last weekI
is for it to continue ignoring the urgency and the dimensions of the
problem.

How many youngsters must die before Government becomes
alarmed? HOW many families of all economic and social strata must
know heartache? Is there within the remote bureaucracy no one
who owns a sense of honest outraze?

Dr. Ronald Kurtz Returns From Liberia
To Discuss conditions all Gutlington

Cuttington College' IS a private
church related, liberal arts
college located 120 miles inland
from the capital of Liberia. Built
on tribal land purchased a cen-
tury ago by one of the American
Colonization Societies who were
returning slaves to Africa,
Cuttington is thought to be the
only American-style liberal arts
college in sub-Saharan Africa.
About one fourth oF its 250 stu-
dents come from African coun-
tries outside Liberia.

Sinre 199-3 the Associated Col-
leges of the Midwest has been
sponsoring a program to give its
graduates the opportunity to
serve as teaching assistants at
Cuttington and to give its faculty
members the chance to serve
on the Cuttington facility. Cut-
tington students can study at
ACM colleges in preparation for
American graduate schools.

The college has always had
limited financial resources, part-
ly because the Liberian govern-
ment and USAID give onlv
limited support to the church»
related school. The college
receives a few donations, but the
bulk of its support comes from
the Episcopal church, w. s. aid
agencies, and the ACM program,
which has been supported pri
marily by the Eord Foundation,
the Rockefeller Foundation, and
by faculty grants under the Fulv
bright-Hays Act. Although many
large American universities have
affiliations with larger African
Universities, none had bothered
with Cuttingtnn.

Dr. Ronald Kurtz, Associate
Professor of anthropology at
Grinnell, spent the last two
academic years at Cuttington
under a teaching and research
program sponsored by the ACM.
During the first year he taught
at the college, but he devoted the
second year entirely to field re—
search.

Kurt: said that it was sur-
prisingly easy to adjust to living
and teaching at Cuttington. The

housing was excellent, and the
college‘s facilities were good. He
was quick to point out that the
college community was some-
what isolated from the surround-
ing peoples, a bit like a colonial
compound. This was the dif-
ficulty in adjusting. The social
structure expects a certain kind
of relationship between faculty
mernbers, most of whom are
white, and the natives of the area.
Mr, Kurtz thought this a little
awkward. For example, “every-
one was expected to hire local
help in the household and not to
pay more than a certain amount
of money for the services."

“A man can, however, obtain
something of great value in a
context he may not like. I thought
that Cuttington was a very good
college." One of the great satis-
[actions for Kurtz was the op—
portunity to deal with such a wide
range of students. There were
Children of tribesmen and of
some of the elite families of
Africa all attending the same
college. Many tribesmen were
doing excellent college-level
work, partly because of the good
training they had received from
missionaries before coming to
Cuttington. All the students were
very challenging, freely
questioning many Western ideas
about politics and education. Mr.
Kurtz added that Cuttington is
doing the best it can to make
its college education relevant to
Africans 7 more African and
fewer European History courses,

a greater emphasis on African
writers in literature courses, and
in general a greater emphasis on
African culture and African
problems. This is a much dif-
ferent approach from some of the
European type schools on the
continent, which maintain unr
alloyed European curriculums.
Cuttington is not affected by the
kind of corruption, e.g. grade
buying. which the University of
Liberia in Monrovia is just be-
ginning to overcome;

Many of the foreign students
who attend Cuttington are re-
ceiving aid from the United
States government under a
program which allows them to
attend school in another African
country. The Africans generally
prefer this to sending students
to Europe or America to be
trained, because often the best
talent never returns from over-
seas to developing Africa where
it is badly needed.

One of the biggest problems
Cuttington College faces is
related to the sparsity of trained
men in Africa. Although the chief
administrators at Cuttington are
Liberians, the faculty is predomi-
nately white and temporary. The
faculty therefore has little sta-
bility. The college recognizes that
the long-run solution is to recruit
Africans to the faculty, but since
there are many challenging ca-
reers available to a college
trained man in Africa, this is

am forced to suspect that Mr.

All of this, however, may have

Early German Films Are Presented To
Portroy Culture of Weimar Republic

in conjunction with the Symr
posium on Weimar Culture
(February 24th-March lst), five
films are being presented — The
Cabinet of Doctor Caligari”
(1920). “Metropolis" (1927),
“Berlin, Symphony of a Great
City” (1927), “Blue Angel" (1930)
and “Triumph of the Will" (1936).
Though each is of cinematic
importance, it was with a view
towards their cultural signifir
cance that their selection was
made. They embrace the
duration of Republican Ger-
many, and collectively document
predispositions in German
Culture which help to account for
the Republic's collapse.

This point of View, i.e.. film
as a sort of cultural barometer,
has been given form by Siegfried
Kracauer 7 From Caligari to
Hitler, A Psychological History
of the German Film his premises
are simple: 1) film, in the period
unde. conSlderation, is unique in
its mass audience, 2) being a
commercial venture, it must
satisfy some need of that mass
audience, and 3) the degree to
which a film satisfies such a
mass need can be assessed both
at the box office and by the
repetition of its motifs as a for
mula of success in other films.
The four Republican Films

qualify on both counts. “Triumph
of me Will," a product of the Nazi
Propaganda Ministry, is particu-
larly telling. In it, tendencies
which are discernible in the
Republican Films blossom into
a totalitarian nightmare.

Principal amongst these
tendencies is the “ornamental
use of humanity.” a des»
cription used by Kracauer
indicate the reduction of the
human content of a film to a
formal, even decorative, visual
pattern. This tendency, in films
like “Berlin, Symphony of a
Great City". extends itself
until the whole of reality is decorr
atively orchestrated. The net
result is that the intrinsic affinity
of the candid shot for unstaged
reality is submerged in the ab-
stract editing of the whole.

A comparison with post-
revolution Russian Films sheds
light on this point. Where editing
in the Russian Films emphasizes
the social content of the shots,
the German Films obscure that
content by editing solely on the
basis of the plastic content of the
shots. This decorative tendency
reaches its apogee in the
newsreels and war documenta-
ries of Nazi Germany. in them,
war itself is reduced to a
decorative panoply, a glorious
ornament in which no men die
and reality is the handmaiden of
an invincible Third Reich.

in the Weimar Years this
decorative principle motivated
not only the “documentaries.”
but even the screen dramas.

of people are choreographed into
anonymous ornamental groups
much as the participants in the
Nurnberg Party Convention of
1934, the subject of “Triumph of
the Will." But in “Metropolis"
we encounter a second major
tendency of the Republican
Cinema, i.e,. a pattern of
rebellion and subsequent submis-
sion to aumority.

Kracauer notes that in the
German Films, the alternative to
authority is always portrayed as
chaos and never democracy.
Hence rebellion resolves itself
into ultimate resubmissiun to
authority. So with “Caligari,” so
with “Metropolis" and so with
the Weimar Republic. The au-
thoritarian psychology of
Weimar Germany as opposed to
the democratic form of its
political institutions is made!
poignantly clear by a reﬂection
told by Kracauer. A review ap-
Dearing in Vorwarts, the Social
)emocratic Party organ, shortly
after the premiere of “Caligari”
embraces the film’s authoritar»
ianism in toto and goes so far
as to underscore its progressive
virtue. The paralysis of the left
during the fascist rise to power
becomes perfectly clear when
one understands that they were
fatally torn between authoritar-
ian and democratic longings.

Correlated with this authori-
tarian regression is a strong
current of antirintéllectualism.
Rationality cannot be embraced
by authority and so must be
destroyed. The individual is
broken or submerged in the
Weimar films as he is Do be under
the Third Reich. Thus the
complete submission to authority
is achieved. In this regard, the
downfall of the high school
professor in Blue Angel is partic-
ularly releva nt,

dividuai humanity. In Germany
there was the danger of an intel»
lectual re-awakening, the reali»
zation at home that people are
killed, tortured, and destroyed
even by the most glorious of
wars.

Two themes were common in
successful German films. One
involves a rebellion and then a
submission to authority. A good
example of this type of film is
“The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari”.
The German press thought that
it was a great film at the time
or its release; they did not con-
sider it opposed to freedom. The
other predominant theme is anti-
intellectualism. The film “Blue
Angel” is a good example.

Professor Klein went on to
outline Kracauer’s philosophy of
film, which appears as if it could
be partly a result of distrust of
the German films. He opposes
formal editing. Rather, the film
should try to capture the “un-
staged reality”, the unplanned.
This principle, says Klein, writes
out many kinds of film making,
and he termed it “rather one-
sided”. Scenes should not be
staged with actors, and there
should be a sense of endlessness
to the plot of the film. Kracauer
is apparently opposed to struc—
tured themes that run their
course within the film. The film
should stress that life is indeters
mimate, that the film~maker
cannot control everything. In
short, Kracauer prefers a motific
treatment of subjects involving
life itself.

Carl Kracauer’s method of
examining film be applied to the
American cinema to give us cues
to the psychology of America?
Klein said yes, with reservations.
In America there are many other
mass media, and many different
kinds of financially successful
films. These factors made Klein
hesitant to draw conclusions, but
he did point out certain themes
that dominate television and
movies. Family life, for one, is
a common theme. The concept
of authority which sees that both
the criminal and the policeman

use Similar tactics is another.
Finally, there is a group of
escapist films (like “The
Graduate”) which use many
visual effects and contain little
social content. Klein then broke
off his formal remarks and
opened up the floor for questions.
The last event of Wednesday
evening explains the bi-line at the
top of this article. I can’t
guarantee - that the
tollowing sketch is very ob
jective, and I don’t wish to ruin
the element of surprise First of
all there were ﬂying marsh-
mallows, an electric violin, and
a faculty member, Mr. Harris,
dressed like the tin man from
the ”Wizard of OZ" and reading
nonsensical German poetry 7 in
German, The amusing thing was
that for a moment those present
listened with the sober respect
one might pay to a serious
reading of a passage from the
Iliad as the tin man waved his
stiff arms meaningfully and
uttered nonsense in a foreign
language. I refer, of course, to
the “Recreation of the Original
Happening: The Dadaists in
Zurich, 1916.” If you like marsh»
mallows, it is a must see.

McCarthy's The Year of the People Selected As
P.P.P.E. Book; Gilmour Recommends Reading

The Year of the People, by
Senator Eugene McCarthy, has
been selected as the February 7
March Political Bookroi~the-
Month, the Program in Practical
Political Education announced
thisweek.

This timely book is an account
of the tumultous and terrifying
events associated with the 1968
presidential campaign by the
man who, perhaps more than any
other, changed the course of that
campaign.

Clearly unaided by the usual
ghostwriter, Senator McCarthy
writes as he spoke in 1968 7
directly, eloquently, at times
with pointed humor, at other
times with real bitterness, He
speaks to a number of the central
questions raised about his per»
sonal quest for the Democratic
nomination: Did he expect to win
the nomination (he hoped to drive
President Johnson into retire-

ment, but he had no hope of ob—.

taining the nomination)? Was
there a feud between him and
the Kennedys (he denies this, but
reveals his impatience and dis-
taste for the style, the use of
money, the elaborate and often
arrogant staff, and the emphasis
on political pragmatism of the
Kennedy brothers)? Why was his
campaign so leeraced, low~
keyed, and mystified (McCarthy
makes clear that politics to him
is a serious, rational, and moral

profession, above petty appeals
to emotion, special interest
groups, or party traditions and
heroes)?

But the volume leaves other
questions ignored or
inadequately answered: Why did
McCarthy resent losing, when he
insisted he has no hopes of
winning? Why did he withhold his
hall-hearted endorsement of
nominee Humphrey until the last
minute? Why did he relinquish
his seat on me Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, after his

strong drive and demand iorva
change in the U. 5. Foreign
policy? Why did he renounce his
Senate seat in 1972 and any desire
to lead his Party toward the
reforms be dismayed?

“This book, although too often
incomplete and disappointing
deserves wide reading and
reflection," remarked C. Edwin
(:‘rilmour (Political Science),
Director of the PPPE. “For it
helps Americans to understand
a cryptic and critical period of
our current pol cal history."

To the Editors:

No weeks ago, my roommate
and l were planning to work on
this semester’s S 5r B. Accord-
ingly, we attended a staff meet-
ing held on Sunday night. We
were dismayed to find that your
political and editorial philoso-
phies differed radically — ii 1
may use that word — from our
own, but we wanted to work on
the newspaper, anyway. 'nlesday

we came to help proofread but_

left in disgust after one hour. it
is impossible to proofread stories
that first need to be rewritten!
This week's paper confirms my
judgment, and l will use the issue
to explain what I think is wrong
ith mg. sea.

Let me start with the basics.

First of all, theS Rt Bis a ”news”-
paper: therefore anyone would
logically assume that news
predominates throughout.
Almost hall this issue is ad copy!
Page three has ad copy and two
columns written by people who
have no connection with Grinnell
College. Yes, current events are
news wherever they happen, but
it’s a pity you use 21/: columns
of space in an a page college
newspaper for columns about the
evils of marijuana ~ trite, to put
it mildly — and the fate of the
Democratic National Committee.

The rest of the copy included
one thoughtless editorial; one
dull article on the humanities
experiment; a reprint of a court
statement; a dull review of an
exciting iolk concert; an ex—
cellent feature on “Battle”

placed as lead news story on the,

front page; a long, dull feature
on the sports page and several
long letters to the editor. Doesn't
sound like too much news, does
it?

Secondly, the S a B is a college
newspaper. Hopefully, a college
newspaper reflects the various
opinion of the student body ~ not
so, however, in our 5&3. Week
after week, you continue I"
produce smug editorials that
damn student movements or
students — and these editorials
are supposed to represent the
student body! 0n the last paper
I worked the author at each edi-
torial had his initials printed at
the end of his editorial. An
editorial is, after all, personal
opinion.

From these basics I turn to
more specific errors. Overall, the
S a: B is guilty of bad journalistic
practice. The copy is generally
poorly written and‘or’dull. with
the exception of ad copy, the
layout is atrocious. Someone had
better learn how to write and
space headlines.

You may use “lack of news”
as an excuse for lack of copy,
but I think you’d be wrong. There

were several stories you could

have used this week such as the
dope on the Steve Miller Band
coming to Grinnell or the
Women's Liberation Conference
in Des Moines. There may not
be a lot happening here, but
certainly there’s enough to fill an
eight page paper with fewer ads
than the currents St Bhas.
Finally, I would complain
about your editorials. In this

week’s issue you printed several
letters that criticized the mis-

Page Eleven

representation and biased tone of
the past editorials — don’t you
read your letters? This week‘s
editorial continues the styles of
the previous ones. I saw neither
of you at the Ptero meeting! Must
you stoop to commenting on a
letter that comments on a meet-
ing you didn’t attend for your
weekly editorial?

Ihope you will read and con-

' sider what I’ve written both in

this letter and on the issue I’ve
returned to you. lhave taken con:
siderable amount of time (and
space, I know) to point out errors
rather than to criticize without
justification.

I'would have liked to work on
the S & B, as I’ll probably end
up being a reporter someday. I
also 'would like to receive a
decent paper once a week. This
is my paper as well as yours;
my money given to the activities
fund paid for it just as well as
yours did. You have no right to
give this college a mediocre
newspaper unless that is the best
you can do. And if that is,thei
best you can dig, get out!

Grapplers Grobbed In Double
Dual Meet By Carleton, Olafs

By John Nigel Pepper

Saturday's double dual meet
pitted Grinnell against Carleton,
and Cornell against Carleton and
St. Olaf. Although the Grinnell
wrestlers lost twice, there were
many outstanding individual per-
formances.

Our first meet against the Carls
of Carleton started with Chuck
Farr winning on a forfeit,
Although we had to forfeit the
125, pound division because
Biown isa transfer student, Mike
wrestled a brilliant exhibition
match, His aggressiveness and
agility led to his pinning his
opponent early in the match.
Mike Brown is sure to be a boon
to next year’steam.

Then both Derek Feilbert and
Henry Corona were pinned in the
early part of their matches. Next
came Klippel’s exciting match.
After almost getting pinned and
almost pinning his opponent,
Mason lost by one point. Even
though Dave Petta fought age
gressively, he was pinned by the
Carleton wrestler.

Jim Weiser’s match followed.
Marked by very cautious
wrestling, Weiser managed to tie
his opponent. Then came
Washington Alston’s fantastic
contest. Overpowering his op-
ponent, Washington pinned him
in the last period, using a halts
nelson, Washington pinned his
adversary to the mat. Counting
the three Grinnell forfeits, the
final score of the meet with
Carleton was 35 to 12, Carleton
winning.

The second meet, about a half
hour later, pitted Grinnell
against St. Olaf. The meet was
marked by many close decisions
with Grinnell at the short end.
In the 116 pound weight class,
Farr lost to an agile wrestler,
o to 2. Later Farr puffed, “They
were just in better shape.”
Brown lost 3 to 4, in a close and
very hardrought match. Derek
Feilbert put out a great effort,
but was Iinally pinned in_the last
period. Then came that “Miami
Flash," llenry Corona. Henry
fought well and avoided the pin,
but lost7t<i o.

The next Wrestler was Mason
Klippell, the dean of the Grinnell
wrestlers. Almost sustai ng an
injury, Mason still dominated his
match and outepointed his ops
ponent. After Klippel was Dave
Petta’s close match. Although he
lost by 4 to 2, Dave showed a
lot of class against a powerful
adversary. Only a couple of
seconds riding time made the
difference, but Jim Weiser lost
to the St. Olaf wrestler by 2 to
I. To say the least, Weiser was
chagrined.

Since St. Olaf had no wrestlel
at 191, they forfeited that
division. Washington Alston, our
191, wrestled an Olaf
heavyweight. In his own inimita-
ble style, Washington controlled
the match with power, speed, and
agility. The score of his match
was 5 to 1, and imagine - he’s
only a freshman! When all of the
Grinnell forfeits were tallied, the
score stood 36 to B in St, Olaf's
favor.

With the Conference meet
coming up in two weeks, Grinnell
has some wrestlers who could
score points, Coach Hunt picks
Farr, Klippel, Weiser, and Alston
as wrestlers who should place in
the tournament. Hunt also thinks
one of the other Grinnell matmen
may provide some surprises at
the Conference meet. The meet
is scheduled for the 5th and 6th
of March at Galesburg, the home
of Knox College. Good luck to

those hearty Grinnell wrestlers.

Tonkmen Triumph,

Tctke New Trophy
By Reggie Graham

Augustana, one of the toughest
small college teams in the
midwest, was beaten in its own
Viking Olympics this year, an
event unprecedented in the eight
years of the meet‘s existence.
The invitational event pitted the
Grinnell Swimming squad
against four non-Conference

(schools, Loras, Rockford,

o’rLuther, and Augustana. A great
team effort and the season’s best
second»half performance
provided our swimmers with a
rewarding victory (and a nice big
trophy).

Bruce Rollins broke records in
the 50 and the 100 to take both
events. Steve Ward took second
in that 100 to add to Grinnell
pointage and team morale.
Steve‘s individual medley was
only .1 second off the school
record.

Mike Daley won the zoo and
finished second in the 500 to set
a new school record. Further out-
standing performances were
turned in by Jim Williams in the
individual medley and the butter-
fly, and by Hal Dale in the same
event,

Don Lilike overcame a bad
board and worse judging to win
a very important first place in
diving competition Only a costly
error in counting laps prevented
John McBlain from capturing
second place in the 1,000.

The team spirit in evidence,
along with the victory at Rock
Island, helps provide the fire that
the team needs against Cornell,
This meet is certain to be the
toughest of the season, and will
determine the winner of the
“Dilly the Duck" award for the
team with the best dual meet
record. We’re up with a grudge
to settle a onerpoint loss to Corr
nell last year. We would also like
to beat last year’s champs and
win “Dilly,"

The season closes with the Con-
ference meet March a and 7 at
Carleton.

Clique-Cleave in Second Confrontation

By Sigiottenbach
“r acuity cagers Gurofi‘, Horton
and Hunt sparked the faculty to
an easy defeat over the Con-
cerned Black Students on Sunday
night." That is not, in fact what
happened. But it is always wise,
when you cover a sporting event,
to go with one good phrase in
your head, if nothing else, This
one pleased me especially, so I
was suitably devastated when the
faculty had the effrontery to
falsify it. (So much for a Liberal
Education: it seems. gentlemen,
that my ideas just aren't as good
as yours. Still, they are mine,
which is more than you can say.)

Actually the phrase was pretty
much ad hoc, and More In Sorrow
Than In Anger. I spent most of
Sunday afternoon thinking about
hooking someone to cover the
game, even going so far as to
check my staff for someone to
do it. However, I got a wrong
number. so this was to no avail,
I did see my staff at the game
however, and she lent me a pen
with which to take notes.

Anyhow, when the Sunday Staff
Meeting rolled around (“What
did you think of it Harry? Dunno
Lloyd, I haven’t read it yet.")
I was still Without a writer. So
Editor Harry Fulton sternly
dispatched me to the game,
barely giving me time to snatch
up my Junior Executive Legal
Pad and to torget my pen. Gird»
ing my syntax for a frightfully
dull event, I never expected this
opportunity to tell you to your
great surprise that it was . . .
a dull event.(frightfully so,
really).

From the outset, I found that

» my Sportswriters’ Phrasemaker
was scarcely equal to the one
casicn. Fortyrthree people just
don't make for local color, after
all. Hardly “a 'packed and
cliecring house", and by no
stretch of the imagination “a
large, enthusiastic throng”, and
not even ”a small, but appreciar

for “twenty-seven people and a
shrill claque of raculty wives and
malingerers.” Unfortunately, I
Couldn't find this one in the
Phrasemaker, so I was forced to
piece it together from some old
Spiro Agnew campaign speeches,
the 1952 Report of the Grand
Army of the Republic (Northwest
South Dakota Division), and
selections from the Oxford
English Dictionary. One can only
be gratetul, in an uncompromis
ing world, tor the Resources in

As for the High Polnts of the
game: Roy Lewis fell off the CBS
bench late in the second period,
and Ray Horton spent five con
secutive minutes on his feet, CBS
immediately protested, but
pretty soon Horton was back on
the floor again and all were
satisfied. Actually, the game was
generally friendly: the CBS
players came up with the
sweetest smiles you ever did see
when it somehow transpired that
a faculty player was touled,
Washington Alston, wrestling at
191 1b., put in an especially fine
performance in this respect. (I
sent Photographer Harry Fulton
down court for some “rebound
scramble under the net” shots.
but they Say he will be back in
action again as soon as the bones
set and they find a way to get
the camera out ofhis ear.)

I'm sorry, ians, but I didn't
have the heart to reach the
coaches tor comment after the
game. Final: Faculty 54, CBS 46,
3 dead, 17 injured.

Next Week; Open Swimming,
vespers in Herrick Chapel. and
turther thrilling adventures of
thelunior Executive Legal Pad.
