The reason is that boys, being
peculiar, base quite a lot (per»

First impressions at Grinncll are
not normally favorable.

three separate statements, Coma

cations, into what seem to be

i What was said by me was to
this effect:

1. More students are entering

As a final word, let me add

change,

Because the climate of concern
is strongly demanding- evaluation
of our community, student gov—
ernment will naturally devote
great effort toward meeting these
problems Yet concern knows no
boundaries; it does not limit it-
self. The scnse or community
that has its matrix on this cam.
pus extends beyond Grinnell.
When issues ot the larger com—
munity become relevant to the
Grinnell student, SGA must re—
spond to this concern, also.

The concern among students
now is primarily directed to.
ward campus problems; yet it
cannot accurately predict that it
will always be so.

The task next year is to re-
vitalize the dialogue on all is

ence, is responsible for evalu-
cting present S,G,A. programs

action that I would follow.

(1) A strong, permanent cur—

tablished. it would consist oi
cnc maior irom each depart
meat and some freshman, an
'irould sci-e to evaluate the

would he held next year to
discuss topics ranging from
the meaning of a liberal edus
cation to questions of adm
sions policy. Also, students
would he encouraged to take
the initiative in gathering Sills
dents and iacnity together in-
iornialiy.

(2) Because the Executive‘
Cabinet directs the A,W,S.Board
and the c. of HP. in their ch»-
orcement ot regulations,
would initiate investigations to
determine ii students aic satis-
fied wtih regulations and with
enforcement, ii students are dis-
satisfied and desire a particular
ichange, then I would, as the
representative of the students,
present to the administration the
reasons tor student discontent

Frank Nye Associate editor of

that the iepor-tci have curiosity

William Spiccr of United Press

The first question that arose
during the panel discussion con—

steer clear of sensationalism.
Millen fielded this question by
Claiming that the reporter cant
ignore the human side of stor-

interest if it repoitcd only the

The problem of censorship

“The dlﬁerent higher religions

ditl'cred, ﬁrst in their picture of
what ultimate reality is like,
and secondly in their precepts‘
tor a human being: attitude
and action towards ultimate‘

Using “The Breakdovills oi

D. Toynbce pointed out that
it is necessary to take philoso-

into account because some, such
as Buddhism, Neoplatonism, and
Taoism, have turned into i'eiig»

"In gcneral," he said, “the

adopt p actices which are “pre

to Alan Simpson, dean of the
college at the U. of Chicago.
Simpson outlincd thcsc

fer" in a recent address at the
American Conterencc of Acae
dcmic Deans

Liberal education, said Simp~
son, is a matter of intellectual
tools. literary skills, some
brcadth oi knowledge, some
grasp ol standards, and some
sensc or style. “it is the ex-
perience which equips a learn-
cr to road, write, think, count,
judgc, and act _ and tn do
so in the light ot a good gen—
eral culture It's an education
in discrimi ion, in creative
imagination, in logical thought,
and in practical wisdom.”
Bemuan'ing the “erosion oi the
old standards," Simpson said he
“would cheer-hilly sacriﬁce any
n um b e r or interdisciplinary
courses in the senior year ior
one successlul course—or expert
encciin English composition."

llc noted the need ior clear
expression in “the mush of

ful thud of bureaucratic jar-

gon, the melancholy masochism ‘

at Madison Avenue, and the
smog which descends on or-
gans like the New York Times
Book Review."

Stressing thc need for “a 1d
cral education at the college le
el," Simpson warned of the
“squeeze produced by the col-
lcgeslevel courses in high schools
and the pleagl‘aduate courses in
college.

“Let, them (the colleges) by
all means build on better stan-
dards from below; but let them
also deiend their duty to civile

both the precocious special-
ist and the luturc citizen. And
let them insist that, in the fur
turc as in the past, it will
normally take them ioui- years
to discharge this duty."

On the role or change in edu»
cation, Simpson commented: “in—
struction is one domain in which
Jen'crsonls doctrine that no So—

in the sober light,

tasks lor “the programs we of-,

ladvalices, said Simpson. How—1
ever he noted that the Collegc
at UC has so far been adectcd
“very little" by the “pl'ollferaa‘
thn of tubes and tapes and,
teaching machines," 1

Education must also be cons ,
corner] with and aware of the
larger, more general problems i
of a changing world, said ‘
t Simpson. ,

One at thesc problems is "the
domestication Of science within‘
jthc general culture," Simpson
,urgcd that an under-standing Of
tseielice as inquiry and of the
,directions and social
,tions of modern science be part
0L the “equipment of an edu—.
cated man."

“The social implications pic. i

Said; “but 'to give the

gested that ‘the systematic study

Cation."

Beyond “exposure to the cul- l
tures of the non-Western mem- 1
hers or thc human family," i
l Simpson looked tor-ward to the

development of “a year—long .

course in world history which .

will occupy the same irnpor- .

tant place in our programs as

the Western civilization course." i

The creation at such a course
is contingent upon “the eliorts olt
scholars to produce a better in»,
tegrated conception of world hiSr
tory than any new extant," he‘
said, for many members of the
historical profession have been
lcontent to supervise dissertations

than attempt “to embrace the

‘ Flie 8&1} Sports staff suppo ts the proposed change in‘
the rule regarding athletic eligibility zit Grinnell College.

1 The 1962763 edition of the student handbook states that
anyone is eligible for inter collegiate athletics if his grade
‘point average for the preceding semester is 2.00 or above,
.or if his cummulatlive grade point average is at. or nbove
‘ﬂ specified minimum (1.70 at end of first semester; 1.80,
second semester; 1.9, third semester; 1.95 fourth semester;
2.00 from then till graduation.)

 

This requisite is just. slightly ilbove the minimum per-
mance that will keep a student off academic probation.
,If n student is on academic probation and ‘l‘uils to raise his
‘mi its by the following semester, he is dismissed from
‘sclool,

for

, The Midwest Conference committee of facility repree
jsentatives and athletic directors voted last November to
lchang’e the conference rulelregarding eligibility. The old
rule, in effect since 1955756, stated that in order to be
.elig‘iblc an athlete must currently be passing in twelve
,llollrs of academic work, and that eight of these 12 credit
illours must carry an average grade of C or better. This
comes out to a 1.67 minimum grade point. The revamped
rule, less specific but on the whole equally demanding.
states simply that anyone who is in school is eligible.

Since there are few students at Grinnell with 2i cunni-
.lative average of less than 1.67, the new conference rule,
is applied to Grinncll College, is. more strict than the old
one.

Next Monday the faculty of Grinnell College will con-
sider the proposed change of the current rule to conform
with the new conference regulation and with our nine sis-
ter schools. One possible objection to this change, an impli-
ed lower g of academic standards. is met, as noted above,
by comprulng the current eligibility rule with the rule for
remaining ill school.

Studies by Mickey Holmes, Gl'innell sports publi y
director, show that there is no appreciable difference be-
tween an athlete's in-season grades. and the same athlete’s.
grades when he is not out for it sport. Holmes’ statistical
data effectively met the argument that a marginal strident
,nlny be pushed over the point of no return by participation
in sports.

Recently the “faculty approved another new rule stat-
ing that any athlete eligible at the beginning of a sports
season would be allowed to finish that season. This affects
the winter teams, whose schedules span portions of both
semesters,

In keeping- with this decision, with the conference rul-
ing, and with the other nine conference schools, ollr faculty
,should vote "yes” on the proposed change.
