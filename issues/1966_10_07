“Snowangel” Bombs; “Chairs" Frenzied and Strong

A Review by MARY MALCOLM

Carlino’s “Snowangel” and Ionesco’s "The Chairs"
opened Tuesday evening before a very uncomfortable
audience. “Snowangel,” directed by Tanya Hovanessian,
was a tedious and awkward presentation of a somewhat
trivial play. Miss Hovanessian’s blocking was inadequate
for the arena theatre. The two actors tended to take posi-
tions and keep them during long monologues, leaving the
audience to look around at a very untidy stage set.

Ken Hicks as John never
seemed to get started in the
role he was playing. It may be
partially attributed to the tact
that it was opening night. Hicks
relied too much on minor at-
lectatlons like tumbling with his
cigarette, jerking his chin, swal-
lowing trequently in a strained
manner. He gave an over-all
impression of a fumbling and
nervous actor rather than a
rumbling and nervous character.
tricks and Brenda Thomas, as
Connie, tailed to direct their
acting at one another, perhaps
because the two characters in
the play tail to communicate or
be really aware of each other.

Miss Thomas acted well at
any given instant, but with a
general inconsistency that spotl-
ed her performance. She chose
to portray Connie as a very
changeable, hot-tempered char-
acter, but did so with more
jerklms than flexibility.

“The Chairs” was uncomfor~
table for the audience also, but
in the way that ionescan drama
intentionally is. J. Dennis Rich
directed the workshop with a
rare combination of creative
Itaging and precise timing, His
use of sound effects in the door-
bell scene was very effective.
Rich took full advantage of the

{eculiarities oi the arena them.

re, The technique ot sending
the actors through the audience

as more effective in “The
, hairs" than i have ever seen
it previously. There was a cer-
tuln stamina in Rich’s produc<
um allowing every moment to

be prolonged just a little too
long and carried a little too tar.
The play was too much of a very
good thing. The “overproduc-
ing” or the play heightened both
its comic and disturbing as
pects.

Rich achieved a symmetry
between his characters both in
their strength as actors and
their positions on stage The

town council in Potsdam, reps
presenting the Social Democra-
tic Party.

Jones as the old man first ap-
peared on the stage and con<
tinuing until the double suicida
was kept up remarkably well
by the actors, Jones' perfor-
mance was more than oom-
patent. He was strong in the
beginning with his description
of the motion 0! the World ”a-
round and around and around"
and he did not falter in the re
mainder oi the performance.

Miss Tinker’s acting was also
excellent. My only criticism is
that she was playing the same
role, that of a demented old
woman, as she played in “The
Phys' Sts” and “The Dream
Play" last year. I suggest di-
versity for Miss Tinker, whose
talent in this Speciﬁc kind of
role is established, Her contro
versial ﬂirtation with the photo-
engraver was a piece oi bril-
liant pantomime and was con-
sistent with the tone of Rich's
production.

The amendment, which has
been in effect on a trial basis
since the beginning of the se<

men to be worn only at sit-

a substantial liheratinn from
previous rules, under which
casual dress at the Quad was
acceptable only at hreaktast.

In the only other business of
the meeting, the Senate unani-

The present controversy over the censorship of a

udent production of ”The Chairs” is an unfortunate

>ncident. It involves a number of complex issues which
end themselves to hasty and dangerous handling.

In this space it is impossible to explicate and com-
ment upon all the difficulties involved. Two points, how-
ever, need to be made.

First, the complexities are immense in this situation
and involve a variety of blunders, past and. presents, on all
sides. These blunders are in some cases inexcusable but
the issues are so involved it is difficult to censure anyone
without some qualification.

The second point is that something should be done
to insure that a similar situation does not arise again.
The role of the college as a censor needs to be clarified
in order to remove both students and faculty from the

osition of trying to second guess the president. What,
Broadly speaking, are the criteria which determine
whether any artistic endeavor is suitable for public show-
ing under the auspices of the college? Who should impose
these criteria in any given area? And how and to whom
can the student appeal what he feels is a too stringent
imposition of these criteria? These questions need ans-
wcrs.

It is the position of the 5&3 that only in the most
extreme instances should the college censor artistic en-
deavor and that in this particular case such action does
not seem justified. The real point at issue is not, however,
this particular case. Rather, some very important lessons
should be learned from this case which will show us all,
students, faculty and administration, where we need to
go in the future.

* i *

As editors go, I am a notably unexciteable sort,
There is, however, one thing on this campus which makes
me very angry. So angry, in fact, that I become blatantly
irrational. That thing is not low student wages, nor is it
women’s hours, or even the archaic visitations restric»
tions, though these things do irritate me occasionally.

What really gets my hair up is that large regiment of
Grlnnellians which seems to think that Burling Library is
an entrenchment Verdun. Somehow, they have the idea
that if they take their books home at night, the Germans
will move in and take over the fort.

But rather than simply condemn, I, like my colleague
who suggested tipping our waitresses, have a construc-
tive suggestion to make. I propose to lead a battalion of
raiders to clear out the mess some evening just before
the library closes.

We can throw away all the trash, and from the looks
of it, most of the tables are at least half covered with
trash. Furthermore, to show our good intentions, We could
salvage everything valuable and sell it at the WUS auc»
tion. The proceeds could be earmarked for an expanded
physical education program for those without enough
strength to carry their books home at night.

Accentuate the PoSItive

With all due apologies to
Grinneli’s operant conditioning
psychologists and to Johnny
Mercer fans, I would like to
note a very unscientific but
highly observable hit of be.
havioml phenomenon: Ani-
mals tend, so to speak, to “at,
centuale the positive and
eliminate the negative." That
is to say, they avoid aversive,
negative stimuli and react to
reittlot-oiog, positive stimuli.
And so, characteristically,
should people.

Now some of you have
doubtless already taken out
your stationery and are pre-
paring to write the editor
heartily asserting that “.
men are not either animals
and how dare Ihe 5&3 print
that, anyhow?" To those of
you so humanistically and
philosophically inclined, I
must say I bear you no mal-
ice; I must indeed acquiesce.

In fact — the next time you
engage 1n verbal jousting with
the behavorlsts — i suggest
you one the Gtinnell student
body as your prime example.

For they, surely, do not re-
act as do normal animals. At
Grinnell, as at no where else I
have ever seen, they accentuate
only the negative and all but
eliminate the positive. The neg-
ativism of the average Grin-
nellian pervades every element
of our daily existence, and even
follows us nightly to the dinner
table:

“The Saga food is no good,”
it begins.

"Yeah, and my lecture classes
are bad."

“Yeah, and North Campus
lacks camaraderie!"

“Yeah? But the dorms are too
much like fraternities,”

“An is up at hy. Apathyl

“Mediocrity ll !”

Valid Generalizat

Among the major issues on
this campus, must of which are
ignored by loudly talking and
gesturing people, is one which
comes closer than most to the
purpose of this school as a lib-
eral ans institution and as a
structure designed deliberately
with the student in mind, This
issue is based on the question:
who should be the ﬁrst to re-
spond to a seeming problem on
campus, the students or the
faculty? To put the question an-
other way: are students’ re-
sponses to be their own or are
they to follow the lead of a
“competent authority” on such
matters that occur? Or to
phrase it again dillerently: does
this school exist {or the sake of
the administration, for the sake
of the faculty, or tor the stu-
dents? Should the student he
told what the proper opinion
concerning a certain matter
should be, or is there such a
thing as a proper opinion?

Case in point: The Chairs, 1:

play by Eugene lonesco, was
presented to the Grinnell audi-
ence Tuesday to be taken as it
was. immediately alter the per-
formance, the head of the the-
ater, Mr. Richard Meyer, in-
iarmed the cast that one section
01 the play was too “gross, las-
civious, and obscene" to be
shown on the Grinneil stage.
The cast was given the alter-
native of changing their inter-
pretation of the play to con-
form to desired standards, or
the play could not be presented
again. Besides violating anis-
tic integrity and pushing to the
side every concept of theater
ethics imaginable, this action
raises several large questions:
is a student production just that
and no more; is a student pro-
duction to be considered as an
an form or not; and last, if it
is to be considered an art form,
is it liable to censorship by any
thing or anyone other than sub-
sequent student opinion? on, is
a student to be told what he is
supposed to think about a work

are often highly entertaining
and highly humorous, they are
beginning to leave a very sour

in my mouth.

I'd like to change my outlook

positive approach, ut 1 must

here, l’d like to see the need
for negative criticism disappear
and find it supplanted by posi-

Student Draft Representative
Seeks Revamping Proposals

3y NEIL FISCHER

The mold-like Johnson bureaucracy reached a way-
ward tentacle onto the campus Saturday, October 1, with

the visit of a representative

of the President‘s new Na-

tional Advisory Commission on Selective Service.

Clifford C. Behnke, one of
Illne student representatives or
the commission in the entire na»
tion, interviewed twenty Grin-
nell students — chosen at ran-
dom —- concerning possible
changes in the Selective Serv-
tce System. Behnke, a Univer-
lity of Wisconsin student and
iormer editor of the Daily Car-
tlinal, emphasized that he was
not here to “take a poll" but
rather to “sound out represem
tative students at radically dif-
fering institutions (or higher
bducation."

Each of the nine student rep-
resentatives, explained Behnke,
question: I number or typical
ltudents on each of four cam-
puses differing significantly in
their educational format. Behm
ke‘s four schools include a small
liberal arts college (Grinnell),
a junior college (Flint Commu-
nity, Flint, Michigan), a church
affiliated university (Creighton
Omaha, Nebraska). and a gar-
gantuan state school (Behnke's
own University of Wisconsin at
Madisonl

Grinnell students were infor.
molly quizzed consenting a mul-
titude of phases of the draft
system — from their opinions
of a possible “lottery" to their
ideas on conscription as a
whole, Those interviewed were
then asked to verbalize any oi
their own proposals on revamp-
ing the system.

Behnke and the eight other
students — representing the
University of Wisconsin, Clark
College. Vanderbilt, Cornell Uni<
versity, the University of in
diana, the University of Cali-
fornia at Berkeley, Yale, the
University of Washington at

Northwestern, he taught phil-
osophy at the University at Wis-
consin and at the University of
Chicago, Later, he taught ooth
philosophy and English at Ohio
State University.

On October 13, Vivas will
speak in Roberts Theatre at

Encampment Scenes, Opinions

Two startling conclusions de-
veloped out of last weekend's
encampment, It was first noted
that the chairman of the board
of trustees is. or at least was,
a disciplinary problem. Shortly
thereafter, the discovery was
made that trampolines are not
an unmixed blessing.

But though these two con.
clusions are of overwhelming
import for most Grinnellians, it
15 best to dwell on more mun-
dane discoveries.

Encampment is tirst of all a
highly personal experience for
the students and faculty who

we

actually participate in it. In that
alone. it probably justifies the
$675 expense (after all, Godfrey
Cambridge cost $2,000).

The full glory of the northern
lowa weeds in their autumn
colors provides a backdrop for-
bidding to the narrow misunder-
standing which usually exists on
both sides of the faculty»student
fence. Somehow. there is an ele-
ment of true liberalization which
forces itself even on such as
the Dean of Men; he looked
really human standing at the
end of his bunk muttering dis-
paragingly “dormitory life. "

The stated purpose of this
year‘s encampment was to ex-
amine the aims and goals of
the Grinnell education. At the
opening session on Friday night,
Steve Kent, President or the
Student Government Associa-
tion stated these goals briefly:
“First to acquaint the student
with the world or knowledge,
Second to teach the student how
to approach this world. Third
a moral element. to help the
student develop within himself
a coherent conception oi the
world.”

Nebulus, yes, it \vas, but it
was a starting point and such
an undertaking seldom achieves
precision.

Mr, Steiner, English, asked
what advantage we as a liberal
arts school have over the lib-
eral arts college of a university.
ray Williams pointed to the en-
tire atmosphere or many uni-

gverslties "the antirintellectual.

anti - thinking. anti » anything"
tone so prevalent in the univer-
sity dormitory.

Perhaps, suggested Hank Bal-
ikov. it is because Gtinnell
"preserves the back-w- the-
womb family type atmosphere
of high school." But Jane Strake
countered. "i don’t know that

'anybody came here wanting to

be isolated from the rest of the
world” to which Mr. Knopf. eco-
nomics, was heard to shout
“Hear! Heart"

Reference was also made (0

called "that masterpiece of

important we have little free-
dam to follow our interests be-
cause there is “too much of a
course mentality: You don’t
have much time to develop
yourself outside your courses."
Shender suggested; "you don’t
want to pick up Balzac. i think
it's the course load not the iso<
lotion."

Bob Johnson carried the dis-
cussion a step further: “I’m
questioning Whether Grinnell is
freeing the student’s mind.”
And Dan Bucks questioned
whether the system allows the
student to develop the critical
attitude or does the student sim«
ply fail to take advantage of .

} Play

(Continued Irom Page I)

Meyer said the character
of the scene made the play
"unacceptable tor the Grinnell
audience.” The scene in ques-
tion involved the female char-
acter's pantomime of the sex—
ual act with an imaginary per-
son.

The female role was played
by Bonnie Tinker, who com-
mented, “I iully realized what
was involved in the role when
I accepted it. The eitect that we
hoped to achieve was to com-
pletely disgust and embarrass
the audience.” Her iamily was
in the audience the night or the
cancellation.

circumslances Confused

The circumstances surround-
ing the censoring of the show
are both involved and cnniusing.
The discussions of the censor-
ship among the various parties
concerned have been equally
coniusing and oiten emotional
and contradictory as well.

Rich directed the play as an
Independent Project in speech
and theater under Mr. Thomas
Somerville, who is new on the
tactilty this year and was a
1964 graduate ct Grinneli.
Somervilie, to whom Rich was
directly responsible, saw a come
piete dress rehearsal and part
0! another rehearsal before the
play was presented, but did not
say anything to Rich directly
concerning the controversial
scener Somerviile told the
sen, “Nothing was directly
said about the actions of the
girl, but I did say tone down
some of the physical actions and
speed the whole play up." lie
added. “I wasn’t judging it
against u Grinneil audience"

lack! Meyu

Somerville went on to say
"I back up Meyer completely
now I just don’t know why 1
old not demand a change in that
articular point at the play."

hen asked about the effect at
the play on the Grinnell audi-
ence Somerville said: “Grinnell
is sophisticated enough to ac-
dept many things, but this
scene was just too repulsive."
When asked if he thought the
administration or iaculty had
the right to go beyond an ad—
visory capacity and actually
censor a student artist,
Somerville replied, “No com-
merit.”

Meyer had not seen the
production previous to the open»
ing night He said, “I made the
assumption that the play would
be given in good taste. It was
not given in good taste.”
Meyer said later that the forni-
cation scene was [he “most
graphic and most distasteiui
that I have ever seen. I don’t
think that it could have been
made much worse."

Reason Unclear

There was much discus-
nion and disagreement between
Meyer and Rich concerning the
reason for the censorship
There was contusion over
whether the play was censored
Ior artistic reasons, moral con<
sideratlons. administration in-
ﬂuence. or all three. Rich
told that the scene was “pur-
posefully made shocking, exag-
gerated and palntul" “After
ltudylng Ionesco and reading
his notes on ‘The Chairs.’ I felt
lhnl I rhould embarrass the

audience and make the audience
feel uncomfortable.”

Rich commented, "The die
rector doesn‘t give a damn
about good taste. I tried to give
a faithful interpretation of Ion-
esco. I do think, howeVer, that
more are still many things
wrong with the play and that:
we need to work on, especially
the timing of it."

Meyer agreed with Rich
that the director's obligation is
to interpret as taithtully as pos-
sible, " but added, “Our artISr
tic standards are intertwined
with our moral standards.” He
said that the audience must be
considered and also noted that
"a director is not a tree agent
at Grinnell College."

Scene Destructive

Meyer said, concerning
the artistic effectiveness of the
play, “that scene destroyed the
rest of the play. One went away
not thinking anything else about
the play. This is my own judg<
ment and I didn’t talk to any-
one else about this before I told
Dennis and Bonnie that they
couldn’t put this on again in
this manner."

In a discussion last night
Meyer said, “The oifense was
primarily a moral offense —
the scene was inappropriate to
the Grinnell audience.” But he
also said in the Same discussion,
“I'm not trying to protect the
morals of the students.” He
went on to say, “If the play had
been presented in a classroom
situation I would have simply
discussed the interpretation and
the suitability at it.“

Meet with Leggeﬂ

Rich and several of the other
students involved met with
President Leggett yesterday to
discuss the censorship. Leggett
said that there was a difference
between a student director in
an academic situation and the
nnrmal role of a directort The
student, he said, comes under
the academic judgment of the
faculty memberr He added. “As
I understand it, Mr. Meyer
iinds the play unacceptable
artistically and I accept his
judgment on this.” In a discus-
sion with Rich on the scene in

question, Leggett commented.

"I understand that Mr. Somet-
ville told you to tone down that
scene.” Dennis replied, “That
is a blatant lie." Tanya Huvav
nessian. director of “Snowan-
gel," and who was also present
at the meeting. told Leggett, “I
thought ‘Sllowllngel’ was more
objectionable morally than was
Dennis’ and less suitable to be
shown to a college or any nudi-
ence. ‘The Chairs' was more or
an intellectual drama.”

"Knack" Controversy

It was also brought up at the
meeting with Leggett that “The
Knack," directed by Meyer and
presented last year during Par-
ents’ Weekend, caused some
embarrassment to the college
when some or the mothers pres-
ent complained. Leggett said
that he thought part of the rea-
son {or the criticism was that
the performance was somewhat
limited by the abilities of the
amateur actors here He felt
that this caused some misin-
terpretation oi the play. He said
that when there is criticism he
is “the one that has to answer
all the letters.”

Meyer commented on “The
Knack" by saying “I made an
e rror in presenting “The
Knack” on Parents’ Weekend.
Otherwise it was It harmless
Show. But the experience made
me more Conscious of the fact
that we should not make errors
in the future.”

Undefined Viewpoint

Meyer had previously re-
terred to “past administrative
experience” as a factor in his
decision to censor “The Chairs."
The part that the “undefined
administration v i e w p o i n t"
played in inﬂuencing the censor-
ship was an additional compli-
cation in any discussion of the
moral and artistic objections to
the play Meyer said, "Per-
sonally I’m against all forms of
censorship, but you are not a
free agent at this college. ideal-
ly the show should stand on its
own leer, but we should face
the tact that the college spon-
sored it."

Leggett later told the Ser,
"Everything that is put on
on this campus, whether you
like it or not, carries the over-

tones of institutional approvalt"
He went on to say “I’m going
to reserve the right to say that
some things are unsuitable to
show to a Grinnell audience. I
think that I have a high toler-
ance though." Concerning the
possibility oi personally review-
ing the play and then passing
judgment on it, Leggett said.
“Mr. Somerville and Mr. Mey»
er know more about this than I
do When a faculty member

finds a work unacceptable I
have to either accept this or
get rid of him."

Alter meeting with Rich last
night, Meyer told the SM}, “I
hope that in discussion with
Dennis and his Cast We can find
ways to play the scene that
would satisiy them artistically.
And it we can agree with them
on this then we may have a
performance in the very near
future.”
