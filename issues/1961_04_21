Becky Reiler Finds Ceylon's Religions
Complex, Almost lhcomprehensiblc

by Rebeccn Reiter

Throughout. these past months.
i have become incredsingly awore
at the prominent place religion
ha in the East, The dominant re-
i u in Ceylon is Buddhtsm. But
this Buddhism isiniiltratcd with
Hinduism and a kind oi paganism
until it appears so vast and come
plex as to be incomprehensible
to the Western mind.

Recently i went on a trip to the
ancient cities of Ceylon, Betcre
we entered the general area of
these ruins. the driver of our car,
a Buddhist, stopped by a shrine
at the side of the road. The shrine
ivas a pititul structure; tiny, dir-,
ty and neglected. The driver got
out of the car and searched the
bushes along the road—side. Fii‘ide
ing the right bush, he picked a‘
branch and hung it on a wooden
rack next to the shrine. He then
bought a coconut from a nearby
stand,

He placed the coconut on a
tiat stone in lront of the shrine
and lifted his hands in prayer.
He then picked up the coconut
and hurled it on the stone, breaks
ing it open. He brought a piece
of coconut to each occupant of
the car. We all silently ate our
piece. although none of us had
any idea of thc significance of
this ceremony. When we left the
ancient cities this same ritual
was periormed.

Our driver later explained to l
us that when we entered the
cities we had, as he put it,
“ieit my own country." To pro. .
tect himself and everyone with
him, he had to perform this .
ritual on leaving and entering .
the “foreign territory."

i asked a Buddhist friend oi
mine about this and he explained
that many people believe Ceylon
is divided into different regiunsu
each having its own special godj
or gods. When a man leaves his,
own region, he must pay tribute
to the god of the territory he is
entering or harm will beiali him,‘

There is a popular religious
ceremony periormed in Ceylon
called a perahera. As definitely
as i can describe it, it is a re—l
ligious parade which takes place
on a full moon night and involv s
carrying the relic of any partic
lar temple through the streets.
The full moon day and night at
every month is a special time oi
worship for Buddhists and is
called Poya .

Near every Buddhist temple .
is a structure shaped like a l
bell and handle. This is called
a dagoba, and it houses relics, .
usually that of Buddha himself. ‘
These structures are usually
rather large. There is no open- i
ing into the interior. inside the
temple is a small replica ot' the
dagoba containing mart: relics.
This is what is carried through
the streets in the pcrahera.

Not long ago, i had the oppon
tunity oi witnessing a pcrahera
This perahera took place at Kel»

The night was clear and the full
moon shone brightly. People
were walking back and forth and
talking excitedly.

Meyer scattered three hits over,
the first four innings and closed;
with nine no-hit frames in whichi
:mly three men reached first,
base. Meyer faced only 30 men
in the last 9 innings. , .

Cornell started things off fast in
the first inning with a double, a
single and a stolen base scoring
one run; their other run crime in
the fourth inning on a base onl
balls. a holder’s choice and a line

box that Meyer couldn‘t put his

Grinnell scored both its runs i
in the thirol inning when start-

which resulted in a hit bats»

by Jim Lowry to score Jack
Freter and Dale Furnish.

Grinnell didn’t. get its first hit
until the fifth inning when Gaiy
