Coach Bowers Sued B& 6 ”11'0” Farmed
By Ex-Grinnellian

At 4:30 PM. last Tuesday in
the Grinnell Police Station,
Justice of the Peace Ed Lincoln
heard the case of State versus
Edd Bowers. Mr. Bowers is
charged with assault under ar»
ticle 691.4 of the Iowa Code in
an incident that occurred at a
private faculty club party in
Main Lounge on December 18,
1969. Mr. Bowers allegedly
shoved Lawrence Frank, 1408
East Street, and struck him on
the arm while Frank was at-
tempting to take photographs of
the party.

In the trial Tuesday, the State
called two witnesses, Frank and
Kenneth Shainess, a Grinnell
student. Frank testified that he
and Shainess entered the lounge
at about 7 P. M. and had begun
shooting pictures and talking
with faculty members, when Mr.
Bowers led Frank to one of the
doors and began discussing the
picture-taking with Frank.
Frank testified that once he lifted
the camera above his head to
take a picture of something
behind Bowers. Bowers, he said,
put his hand on the camera and
shoved slightly 7 blocking the
shot. Later, Frank testified,
Bowers struck him on the arm
as he was attempting to take an-

. other picture.

The defense also called two
witnesses. Mr. Nick Ryan,
Director of Placement and Stu-
dent Aid at Grinnell, testified that
the dinner was a faculty club
party and that no students had
been invited. He said that he had
talked to Shainess at the door-
way, asking him to leave, while
Bowers talked to Frank. Ryan
thought that Bowers asked Frank
to leave. He_ said that the
discussion between Frank and
Bowers was not heated.

Mrs. Oda Callison, Secretary
to the Dean's Associates testified
that faculty members had paid
for their dinner. The club, she
said, is a membership club. Mrs.
Callison also said that Ryan,
Bowers, and Mr. Raymond Boyd.
Assistant Professor of Physical
Education at Grinnell, had asked
Frank and Shainess to leave the
party.

Mr. Bowers. a Professor of
Physical Education at Grinnell,
is on leave for the second
semester and could not testify at

the trial Tuesday.

Justice Lincoln asked the
defense to file a brief. He
promised to hand down his
decision on or before February
third.

Last Semester there were
rumors on campus that the
employees of the Building and
Grounds Department of the
college were considering the
formation of a union. These
rumors were confirmed recently
in a statement released by the
President’s office. the text of

Pre-Prolessionals: Ph.D. Buyers’
Markei in Academic World

Ph. D candidates seeking jobs
this winter quickly found out that
the supply oi‘teachers has exV
ceeded the demand for them.

At the annual meeting of the
Modern Language Association in
Denver, only half the number of
departments recruited new
members this year than did last
year. One department chairman
reported receiving more than 600
applications for five positions.

When the American Historical
Association met in Washington.
it was reported that 2,000 men
were seeking only 400 positions.

The greatest scarcity of jobs
seemed to be in the Humanities:
however, men in the physical and
natural sciences reported that
they were finding it increasingly
difficult to secure jobs.

Among the reasons cited for the
job scarcity are: There was a
vast increase in student
enrollment in the early 1960’s.
Many of these students went on
to graduate school and then into
the teaching profession. In ad-
dition, John C. Gerber, chairman
of the department of English at
the University of Iowa, noted that
the academic life was becoming
increasingly attractive to young
people. He said that 80 per cent
of the majors in Iowa’s depart-
ment of English plan to teach.
Further, there has been a
reduction in the rate of growth
of undergraduate enrollment
which means that departments
have not been expanding their
staffs.

Henry w. Sams, chairman of
the department of English in the
Pennsylvania State University,
noted that Students in graduate
schools have shown an increasing
reluctance to teach freshmen. “If
one of them had said, I like fresh-
men; I want to teach them, I
would have picked up the
telephone and Offered him a job,
budget or no budget," Mr. Sams
said.

A faculty member from a
relatively new institution in the
South, who was at the meeting
in Denver, commented:

“We’re getting applicants this
year who wouldn't have dreamed
of applying several years ago. I
really feel sorry for some of these
fellows."

Many radicals and women are
especially worried about the
shortages in the job market. The

radicals expressed the opinion
that the job shortages would
create an “army of the unem-
ployed” from which the in
stitutions would select only the
most conservative prospects. lt
was further noted that, in a tight
market, women do not get hired.
This situation was said to exist
particularly in the field of
history.

which is below. Contract
negotiations are to begin in early
February, and a lawyer, James
L. Rogers, will represent the
College in its negotiations with
the union in question, the
Teamster'sUnion.

Apparently aware of the in-
terest in unionization on the part
of Buildings and Grounds em-
ployees, Teamsters Local
Number 90 sent a labor organizer
to the campus early last
semester, and he obtained the
signed authorizations of several
employees to represent them in
collective bargaining. After 47 of
the 92 Buildings and Grounds
employees had signed such
authorizations, a first meeting
was held the night of November
20th at the Grinnell Chamber of
Commerce Building, where the
potential union members were
addressed by Paul Neal, a
representative of Teamsters’

Book Store Addition Announced;

To be Completed

At a meeting of the faculty and
staff early this week, President
of the College Glenn Leggett
announced plans for the con-
struction of a new addition to the
College Book Store. The addition
will extend beyond the current
location of the. book store to the
east and add several thousand
square feet to the present capac
ity of the store, enabling it to
handle an increased volume. The
building has been planned to
reﬂect the architectural styles of
Burling Library and the Forum
and will form with these build-
ings an aesthetic triangle of simi-
lar glass front architecture sur-

by September

rounding central campus.
Although the Library and Book
Store committee has yet to decide
on the final disposition of the new
space, it is known that the
present drop of a few steps into
the area of the book store will
be retained at the present point,
and that the new addition will
be at ground level. A covered
walkway is to lead from the rear
of the book store into the entrance
of the Post Office, thereby elimi-
nating the dangerous accumu
lation of snow or mud which now
renders the passage into the Post
Office from the east unpleasant.

Local 90. A question and answer
period followed his address.

Later, on December 22nd, an
election was held among the
emolnvees at the college at which
it was voted by a majority of
67 to 25 to allow the Teamsters’
Union to represent the workers
in collective bargaining with the
college.

During the period of these
negotiations, David Horwatt, a
Grinnell College student, was
functioning in the capacity of a
“participant observer," part of
his work for an independent
project in political science taught
by Dr. Neal A. Milner, Assistant
Professor of Political Science.
Horwatt has commented that one
of the major issues involved is
the payment of equal salaries to
maids and janitors. It is im—
portant, he believes, that equality
of these sexes be demonstrated
in word and deed in employment
and hiring practices. Com,-
menting on this, college ads
ministrative officials have
pointed out that the maids and
janitors actually perform quite
different tasks, with the janitors
occasionally being called on to
do heavy lifting. Nonetheless,
students in favor of the union
insist that the tedium involved
in the jobs of the maids can be
as wearing as the heavier work
of the janitors.

The cost increase anticipated
in meeting union demands will
serve to explain to some extent
a rise in the operating deficit of
the college over the year.
Although not all salaries are to
be raised, according to the
union‘s demands, to the same
extent as the maids,’ the cost'to
the college represented by
buildings and grounds will
possibly double by 1971.

Above is an architect's drawing of the new addition to the book store. Whether or not the entrance
shown on the north wall is to remain part of the plan is under consideration.

Late last semester a group of students, includ—
ing the Senate, composed a paper entitled The De»
cision-Making Progress at Grinnell College: The
Student Position and Proposals for Structural
Change. In it they offered a program for student
power in academic, social, and administrative mat-
ters, The arguments for this assumption of power,
such as they are, rest on two principles. First, since
the education of the students themselves is the rai-
son d’etre of the college. they ought to have a voice
in the formulation of the policies which directly af-
fect their education. Second, the principle of demo-

cracy ought to be operative in any liberal arts col-'

lege, both because it is inherently just and because
student participation in government is a valuable
educational device by which the college can produce
responsible and intelligent graduates These are
beguiling arguments, as evidenced by their growing
acceptance on many campuses, One can perceive in
the student manifesto the rhetoric of self righteous
indignation and a certain smugness that comes from
the belief that here at last is a call to radical action
which is not simply an invitation to destruction. Un-
fortunately, these arguments, written in execrable
prose, rise above the insipid only to reach the level
of fatuity.

We agree wholeheartedly that the education of
the students at Grinnell College should be the pri-
mary concern of the administration, faculty, and
mirabile dictu, the students themselves, From this
principle, however, it does not follow that equal stu-
dent participation in the formulation of college poli-
cies is the best means to this end. Particularly in
academic policy, it is madness to give a
equal vote to the students who have implicitly ad-
mitted by their presence in the college that they do
not know the matters which they propose to govern.

There is perhaps some validity in the analogy
of a doctor and a patient. Clearly, the end of the re
lationship between the doctor and the patient is the
health of the patient, But is it not absurd to believe
that the doctor and the patient ought to have an
equal vote in choosing the appropriate medicine or
treatment? To believe this is tantamount to believ-
ing that goodness or truth may be determined by a
majority vote. Of course, the doctor may make a
mistake and it is even possible that in a given in-
stance the patient may happen to be right and the
doctor wrong concerning the best remedy. But if
the patient distrusts the motives or the skill of the
doctor he is free to consult another man. In most
cases, however, it is the doctor who is in the best
position to determine what is conducive to the
health of the patient. Similarly, we believe that the
faculty and administration, though they have, at
times, shown an embarrassing lack of good sense,
are in the best position to formulate academic and
administrative policies. And in a small college such
as Grinnell where almost everyone is forced to live
on campus, there is some question as to how much
we can separate social policy from academic policy
without making the latter ineffective. We deny that
democracy should be the political principle operat-
ing on campus. In fact, in the present situation, we
are best governed by a genuine aristocracy, albeit
an imperfect one. Practically speaking, we must

We the undersigned believe
that the policy of Grinnell College
Forum grill has been unduly
harsh in its stance on choosing
new soft drink ﬂavors. We got
Dr. Pepper without being con-
sulted by either the Dean’s office

2) All furuler decisions
regarding soft drink ﬂavors

be turned over to a student-

To the Ediloﬂslz

Try though I may, i cannot
resist answering Krystina Neu-
man’s letter in the last issue of
the 8&3. Although the cone
siderable hysteria in it doesn’t
warrant a reply by anyone, the
serious question which she raises
does. Further, it deserves a reply
from someone whom she’d
regard as being in lhe local
Publications Establishment. And
as chairman oi last year’s Com
mittee on Student Publications
and Radio, I no doubt qualify.

First, let me fulfill her (and
many others’) expectations by
pointing out that she has not done
the homework required of a good
journalist: she has not bothered
to read the document which
replaces the old Board of Publi-
cations with the Committee
“Statement of Revised Duties for
Committee on Student Publi-
cations and Radio,“ see Faculty
Handbook, pp. 79-32.) If she had,
she would have learned that the
Committee is not “dominated by
the faculty-administration
block.” Rather, its voting
membership comprised: “three
faculty members nominated by
the Committee on Faculty organ-
ization and elected by the Facility
and three students appointed by
the President of the S.G.A. and

have some measure of trust in the faculty and ad-
ministration, although we admit that this is a pros-
pect exceedingly distasteful to many. This is not to
say, of course, that students ought not to be consult—
ed in all these matters or that, on occasion, some ex-
cellent innovative ideas have been proposed by stu-
dents. But in the long run we believe that student
power would tend to be more corruptive than edu-
cational,

We students are sufficiently aware of the falli-
bility of the faculty and administration. We ought
to be equally aware of our own fallibility and relae
tive ignorance lest we are compelled to endure the
tyranny of our majority.

approved by the Student Senate”
(17.50.)

Also, she would have found no
documentary evidence whatso-
ever supporting her implication
that the Committee is protecting
“the college’s status quo image.”
instead that body is solely con-
cerned “to protect its (the
College’s) legal interests;" less
euphemistically, to protect its en»
dowment from legal suits arising
from libelous material in student
(publications. That this is the sole.
operational concern is evidenced
by the fact that the document
permits the College to withhold
puhlicationof such material “only
when it has been advised by legal
counsel that its legal interests are
in jeopardy.” (See “Statement of
Policy and Procedures: Student
Publications,” which cum-
plements and implements the
above mentioned Statement and
which is 3 available from the
Committee or the Professional
Adviser.) Could the College do
otherwise? Could it knowingly
allow unlawful material to be
published?

The student editor is allowed
nearly as much freedom as is
compatible with abiding by the
laws of libel. 1 say “nearly"
because the document does also
include a vague clause stating
that the editor shall avoid “in-
decency, undocumented allega-
tions, attacks on personal integr
rity, and the techniques of
harassment and innuendo.”
(Incidentally, this clause ex-
presses the usual canons of
responsible journalism and is
quoted verbatim from the “Joint
Statement of Rights and
Freedoms of Students," endorsed
by the AA.P and the N,s,A,;

Suggestive of its rhetorical style

is the front page oi its house

of his death a photograph of

Robert Kennedy in a pool of his

to the likeness of a pig.

Do you think Robert Kennedy
was a pig, I asked Eldridge
Cleaver awhile ago? Yes, he said.
Did he believe in the elimination
of the pigs? Yes he did. Well,
why not begin with Nixon: surely
he is the chief pig? I observed.
Mr. Cleaver, who has had inti-
mate experience with the law,
advised me that he knew enough
not to counsel directly the assasV
sination of the president, but that
in fact if someone did kill him.
that would be one less pig in the

So what do we do about the

Bernstein the conductor, we have
a big cocktail party to which we
invite a local representative of
the Party, and at the cocktail
party we are so ingratiating that
the Ford Foundation should have
brought back Alistair Cooke so
that the hungry of this world, like
you and me, might have been
permitted via television to be
present at the love-in.

Mr. Bernstein was modishly
dressed, in turtle-neck sweater
and double breasted jacket, and
had obviously been studying up
on the idiom of the times, indeed
so thorough is Mr, Bernstein that
it is altogether possible that he
staged a rehearsal or two,
because a dialog with a Black
Panther is every bit as difficult
to perform as a symphony of

Panther, Mr. Cox, began by an-
nouncing that if business didn't
provide iull employment, then
the Panthers would simply take
over the means of production and
put them in the hands of the
people, to which prescription it
is recorded that Mr. Bernstein’s
reply was, “I dig absolutely.”

Mr. Cox told the gathering how
very paciﬁc he and his conteds
crates are, that ultimately of
course they desire peace, but that
they have been attacked in their
homes and murdered in their
beds and have the right to defend
themselves. “I agree one hun-
dred percent,” Lenny said,
neglecting to ask Mr. Cox to
explain what defensive uses his
Confederates intended to put the
hand grenades and Molotov cock-
tails that were discovered in the
raids,

One lady present, wife of a
Black Panther who is in jail on
the charge of planning to kill a
few pigs and conspiring to
dynamite mid-town department
stores, expressed great in-
dignation at the interruption of
her husband’s activities by the
police, who recently arrested 13
Panthers, holding ten of them on
$100,000 bail. She brought along
her lawyer, who asked the dis
tingulshed gathering oi artists
capitalists for donations. Some
one who desired to be anonymous
promised $7,500. Sheldon Hal‘s
nick, the lyricist, came in with
$250. Burton Lane, the composer,
gave $200, and Mrs. Harry Bela-
iontc gave $300. Lenny said
proudly that he would donate the
proceeds lrorn his very next
concert. He is loo shy a man to
say how much he earns per
concert, but he didn’l want to
appear a tease, so he said the
sum would be in four figures.

We should study the Bernstein
approach. it is a singular contris
bution to conviviality, No doubt
Mr. Bernstein curses himself for
having only just now discovered
it. Just two years ago he might
have invited George Lincoln
Rockwell and his Nazis into his
apartment, to ask him to explain
the causes of his grievances, and
raised a little money for those

side of the law, though to be sure
Rockwell would not have been so
romantic a guest as he never
actually advocated killing
anyone. 0n the other hand, there
are surely still around enough
members of the Ku Klux Klan
to fill Mr. Bernstein’s living
room, or atleastmostofit.

I remember, in the hour I spent
with Mr, Cleaver the one thing
I said to him that made him truly
angry. It was that the Black
Panther Party exists primarily
for the satisfaction of white
peopie, rather than black people.
The white people like to strut
their toleration, and strip
themselves of their turtle neck
sweaters to reveal their shame.
The Panthers have only a few
thousand Black members,
because the mass of the black
people are too proud, too unaf-
fected, to join the Panthers. to
attend Leonard Bernstein’s
parties.

A WORD EDGEWISE

by John P. Roche

Biairo finally
went under. The
breakaway Ibos
regime, outnum-
bered and out-
g u n n e d, had

*‘ fought d e 5 per
ately to r its
autonomy, But,
despite Biblical
reassurance, Go-
liath usuallv has

an unbeatable edge over David.

No neat account can be made
of the rights and wrongs. The
Federal Nigerian government
was asserting the principle of
majority rule; the Ibos demand-
ing protection for minority rights
which would have destroyed
Nigerian sovereignty. Though the
participants were black Africans,
the terms of the dispute were
familiar to sixteenth century
French Huguenots (demanding
absolute guarantees against
Catholic power) and to
nineteenth century Poles (ate
tempting to prevent Russian
”cultural genocide”). Historical-
ly, there has been no workable
compromise 7 we in the united
States fought one of the bloodiest
civil wars in history to determine
the location of final power. To
be a little bit sovereign is like
being slightly pregnant.

So much for history, so much
ior logic. The implications of
Biafra must be explored on a
different level. In human terms
what has occurred in the past
three years is simply monstrous.
Reliable British sources indicate
that over 2,000.0001bos have died,
the bulk of them women and chil-
dren who have starved to death.
(Nigerian losses have also been
severe, but do not approach the
same order of magnitude.)
Starvation has been used as a
weapon by both sides; by Lagos
to weaken the Biafran capacity
to resist; by the Biafrans to
generate sympathy and support
from the World outside.

in terms of human suffering,
using the admittedly inadequate
index of mortality figures. the
war in Nigeria was the worst
event of the 1960’s. (Probably
second was the virtually un-
known Sudanese pacification or
three southern provinces — the
Arab regime moved ruthlessly
against the black inhabitants 7
with a death toll now_ estimated
at over 1,000,000.) Yet. in a world
full of international and regional
organizations, nobody did
anything about it.

NO APPROVALS
ON THESE.

The Red Cross and various
religious groups tried valiantly
to succor the starving, but, while
too many human beings were
dying. the issue could not even
get discussed at the United
Nations and was buried quietly
by the Organization of African
Unity. The reasons for this were
not hard to discern (I set them
out here a year ago with the
somber prediction that there
would be no change 7 alas, l
was right), but a universal un-
willingness to tangle with the
explosive minority question has
turned the Eastern Region of
Nigeria into a vast graveyard.

Since the “International
Community” took a dive on
Biafra, the question arose:
“Should the United States do
anything? l’ An interesting United
Front, ranging from Senator Tom
Dodd to figures on the New Left,
said, “Yes," but, when pressed
as to WHAT we should do, they
got fuzzy. Their advice seemed
to be that we should call Lagos.
or London, or U Thant or Haile
Selassie (of the Organization of
African Unity) and tell them-him
“Something must be done!" This
was not terribly helpful. It would
have been more appropriate to
simply send the lbos a wreath.

I had a plan founded on my
rejection of the use oi starvation
as a weapon, the perhaps
Utopian notion that has led me
over the years to support feeding
Greeks, under Nazi occupation,
Red Chinese, the Egyptians, and
recently Nigerians of whatever
persuasion. Unlike other forms
of death, starvation is uniquely
the fate of the innocent, the
marginal, the unimportant. I
wanted the US. government to
announce that planes loaded only
with food and medicines Would
ﬂy in reliei supplies to any area
of Nigeria suffering from disease
and famine A- and that USAF
fighters would convoy them
against the unlikely event that
somebody would try to knock
them down.

Although I knew of no other
way to get food and medicine to
the dying, my friends fled in
horror. “You might get us into
another Vietnam" was the
standard response. Fair enough.
i have supported risk-taking
before. But this would have been
a unique blow for the sovereignty
of humanity, rather than for any
parochial definition of national
interest. In any event, the politics
of inaction killed 2,000,000 people,
a point to be kept in mind when
we discuss the consequences of
American disengagement from
the turbulent world.

VISTA Needs

Volunteers
For Program

“If you‘re not part of the
solution, you’re part of the
problem." These are the by
words of VISTA, (Volunteers in
Service to America). Volunteers
serving with VISTA help to
counter the ignorance, apathy
and prejudice which have histori-
cally dominated the poor in this
country. Volunteers serve
throughout the United States and
its territories, working in the
heart of decaying urban ghettos
or in the depression and misery
of poverty found in rural areas,
Indian reservations, and migrant
camps. VISTA workers work
long, hard hours with these
people. Their job is a simple one
— find out what the poor want
and need most and try to respond.

VISTA workers are volunteers
for one year. That isn’t a very
long time. They can’t expect to
solve the problems for the poor
in that time, but maybe they can
help the disadvantaged find ways

Calls for Use
Of Coffee House

”A college is only as good as
its coffee house.”Anon.

The forum coffee house has
gone unused for too long. At
present, it is only used as a place
to sit when all the tables in the
grill are being used. The very
term “coffee house” should
conjure up visions of good food,
music, decor, and discussion. Our
coffeehouse has all the faults
that seem to go hand in hand
with institutional architecture,
such as uncomfortable furniture,
poor lighting, and cement walls
that defy one to put up posters
and bulletin boards.

The time has come for the
students to convince the powers
that be to repair the espresso
Coffeemaker and allow pastries
or sandwiches to be sold. There
is money available for bringing

Republicans Plan ‘Action’

Last Sunday eleven leaders of
the Iowa College Republicans
met on the Grinnell campus to
lay plans for their January 30—31
conference in Des Moines and to
discuss their new community
action program, “Action Now.”

The conference will be held in
conjunction with an Iowa Repub—
lican Party “Mission 70" confer-
ence that same weekend. In a
letter to the College GOP chair-
men, Calvin Crane, Chairman of
the College Republicans of Iowa,
said that the purpose of the two
conferences is to launch the or»
ganizational and financial
campaigns [or this election year.
The theme of the College Repuir
lican conference is “Involvement
70.” Plans call for participants
to attend a session of the Iowa
Legislature on Friday and to
pdrticipate fully in the
Republican Party conference on
Saturday. In addition, discussion
groups on topics of special inter-
est to the College Republicans
will be arranged as time permits.

The “Action Now” program is
being directed by Phil Sasich, a
Grinnell College sophomore. Ac-
cording to Mr. Crane, the pro-
gram is to be twofold. First,
Community Action Centers Will
be established in various urban

centers will act as clearing
houses for complaints from local
residents and will attempt to
bring problems to the attention
of government officials who can
help. A similar center has been
operating in the ghetto area of
Detroit for almost threeyears.
The other phase of the “Action
Now” program is to encourage
voluntary community action and
to stress the need for Republicans
to become involved in worthwhile
community projects. National
Republican headquarters will be
conducting an educational
program on the problems of drug
abuse, conservation and pol-
lution. “Local clubs will be asked
to begin projects to correct

Crane. In a memo to iowa club

AFROTC Seeks
Early Phasing Out

Tile AFROTC
has petitioned

unit at Grinnell
the college to
accelerate the phasing out of
their program at the college.
What follows is the text of Dean
Wall’s letter to Colonel Steger
notifying him of the Executive
Committee's approval of the
program.

Colonel Jack M. Steger
Department of Aerospace Studies
Grinnell College

Grinnell, Iowa

Dear Colonel Steger:

This is to inform you officially
that both the Faculty Committee
on Academic Standing and the
Executive Council of the College
have approved of the proposal for
an acceleration of the phasing out
of the AFROTC Unit at Grinnell
College, to be effective by 1 Sep-
tember 1971.

This year's class of six
sophomore men now enrolled in
the program, in order to com-
plete the academic requirements
to be commissioned as officers
in the United States Air Force
at the time of their graduation
in May 1971, will have to take
6 hours credit in Aerospace
Studies during the academic year
1970771. The Committee on
Academic Standing gave serious
consideration to these men to
facilitate their completing the
academic requirements of the
program during their junior
year, including petitions for over-
loads and for counting the Aero—
space Studies program as meet
ing their upperclass secondary
field requirement if the cadets
so wish. The Executive Council
has approved of the Committee’s
suggestions.

We shall await further word
from you regarding the phasing
out program.

Sincerely,
Joseph F. Wall
Dean of the College

sec Handbook, pp 791.) However,
the latter terms are intentionally
not defined in the document so
as to allow the editor leeway.
This is a far Cry from Miss
Neuman's allegation that tlle
editor must “comply ivitli Board
of Publications definitions of
good taste. what to print, etc.”

As for her contention'that the
editor’s opinions must "conform
to status quo Grinnell stanr
dards." it’s clear to anyone who
has read the 8&3 over the last
two years that the editors’
opinions have been more oiten
Ardent Activist that Archetypal
Aristotelian. Indeed one extra
polates (with some trepidation)»
that we are due to have another
Aristotelianl But rather than
being evidence of a “compromise
conspiracy” between the two
main political factions in the
college, this is an amusing ac-
cident. As everyone knows, the
prevailing political persuasion at
Grinnell is Old Leftist.

Out of all these false premises,
Miss Neuman draws her con-
clusion: “Obviously the cam-
paign for restructuring . . . .
Grinnell publications must be
resurrected.” That this con-
clusion is by no means obvious,
however, is indicated by the
recently disseminated “Student
Position" paper. With respect to
the Committee on_ Student Publi-

cations and Radio it recomr
mcnds: “The membership,
structure and duties of this com
mittee shall remain as they are
presently defined.”

Still, lest it be claimed that the
faculty’s collective imagination
is limited by the studcnts'
suggestions (as I sometimes
fear), I will present some tbaoke
ground for the consideration of
one ofMiss Neuman’stwo serious
suggestions (the other in-

volves printing techniques, which .

I am incompetent to discuss):
“Investigation of the formation
of an independent student core
poration which would be respon-
sible for all student‘s publi-
cations.” This is “not unreal~
istic,” she argues; “the Harvard
Crimson is run this way, for inn
stance.” Now, even though we
know Grinnell as the “Harvard
of the West,” I would remind us
of one difference: Harvard’s
enrollment is about 16,500; Grin-
nell’s, 1200. This is a difference
which makes a difference when
one tries to recruit Students to
do the extra work required by
an independent newspaper.
Besides having to find ones who
are willing to act as editor and
business manager (positions
which the Committee has not
been able to fill for more than
one semester), the corporation
must find some who are willing
to sell the publication, Anyone

SCARLET AND BLA

knows that this path is not only
arduous, but also strewn with
pitialls oiarrcst, seizure, etc,

As long as I've breached the
ugly subject oi money, l might
as well open Pandora's box
completely. The monolithic point
which must be made regarding
an independent corporation is
that it really must be inde
pendent, not just at the “faculty-
administration block,” but also
of S.G,A.; not just adminis
tratively, but financially as well.
For S.G.A. receives 'its funds
from that block, and is thus
legally inseparable from it. Thus,
the ﬂedgling corporation must be
cut off from the usual patrons.
(Insofar as the oppressive Ad
ministration” almost regularly
bails student piiblications and
radio out of large deﬁcits — a
little known [act 7 it must be
seen as a Golden-EggrLaying
Goose.) It is my understanding
that before the Committee was
established the possibility of an
independent corporation was
discussed inrormally with some
S.G.A. officials and dismissed by
them at least on these financial
grounds.

Let us assume, however, tor
the purposes of further argument
that some group of students is
willing to tackle these financial
problems and establish an inde
pendent publishing corporation.
What other factors are relevant?
<1) The college now uses the

student media as practical for its
Communications Studies
program. This complicates, but
need not eliminate. the possibility
of an independent corporation.
(2) The corporation would have
to ask just what the Committee
asks, namely, that is as publisher
not be involved in suits arising
from libelous material in its
publications. The difference is, of
course, that it may be more
liberal in its assessment of What
is potentially libelous. Further,
by not serving the greater Grin
nell community (including
alumni, iaculty, and parents.) it
need not be limited by that com-
munity’s taste in matters of
decency, etc. (3) However, as
long as Ptem continues to come
out, even in the fits and splashes
that it does, is there a need or
demand for second such publi-
cation? One’s impressions that it
is neither widely read nor operas
tionally supported by students

on of “rights" will be both fore-
most and fundamental. it seems
to me, therefore, worthwhile to
examine die idea of “rights," for
I find that each group 7 “fac-
tion” is what Madison called
319,111 in his now forgotten 10th
Federalist # pays far more at-
tention to the word modifying
“rights" than it does to the word
”rights” itself, to the basic,
fundamental, relevant. essential,
real, true thing. We have
“human” rights.‘ women‘s"
rights, “student” rights, “AfroV
Negro-black" rights, “silent
majority” rights — but all these
groups seem to take the existence
of“rights" for granted.

We should observe first that the
very word “right" presupposes
not only a system of morality but
also an absolute system of
morality. “Situation-ethics.” as.
relativism 'and immorality are
now euphemistically (but
euphoniously) called, are not
relevant to “rights." I find,
however, that those who most
insist on their “rights" are
'relativists, thatTthey argue
against absolute morality. It
would seem that until they
resolve this contradiction they
ought to refrain from insistence
and apply themselves to
elemental logic and philosophy.

If the universe be meaningless
and the result of chance, if nature
be ”heartless," “witless,” and
apathetic, and if there be no
“better nature or God” — as Ovid
put it 7 there can be no such
thing as a right. Existence would
be no better than nonexistence,
life no better than death, and
whatever was would be right
simply because it was. The
concentration camps of the
Nazis, the atrocities in Viet Nam,
the trial of the seven at Chicago,
the FBI, the dope pushers,
Barbra Streisand, and Peter
Fonda 7 all would be equally
“right”alld have“rights."

If, on the other hand, nature
has meaning and either is itself
the “better God“ or the result
of His goodness (though
corrupted, of course, by man),
then rights, and wrongs, exist 7
but only as conferred by nature
or God Without Such conferring,
man has no rights under either
meaninglessness or providence.
Thomas Jefferson, as even a
Deist, was far above both the
agnostic and the atheist, and for
all his iuzzymindedness, he
grasped this point: as the
Declaration of Independence puts
it, men are ”endowed by their
Creator with certain unalienable
rights.” The existence of a right
pro-supposes a conferrer of the
right.

A “right”, then, is a species
of the genus grace. (I hurry the
argument, I know, but a letter
is not the place to work out all
the details: those concerned to
know more will find me ac»
cessible). Man exists as man
because God allowed him to; his
first job is to understand what
a man is, so that he can, in
Pindar's words, “become what
he is.” The essence of man is
free will operating on the basis
of reason, for even love is
grounded in reason. And free will
presupposes choice, order. and
responsibility. Those ab—
stractions contain in them the
process of existence, desire,
analysis, pleasure, and pain, on
the basis of which we judge and
arejudged.

The same groups which cry for
their “rights” scream for the
power to obtain them, as if rights
depended on power. Power is, of
course, an indispensable means
to any action; but power does
not make right, nor is right
destroyed by power. Power, you
see, is only physical, whereas
right is moral. Morality is to
power as form is to matter: a
bad morality is a bad form and
will shape matter in unjust and
unbeautiful ways, A bad power
is matter moving without reason,
Hence the Worst morality is that
in which power becomes a means
to morality, as if the end could
ever justify the means,

The only safe and sane and
sanctioned way is the moral way.
And the moral way is the way
of man’s essential nature,
reason, for every man is a
potential imitation of the Logos,
made in its. and His, image.

it would be an appropriate
suggestion this term to declare

beginning it. Come, let us reason

January 19th, President Leggett
announced that the college had
bought a house from Denniston-

house will be moved to the lot
located between Conference

contain Mr. Morris’ develop

which is presently located in the
basement of Steiner Hall.

President Leggett also
reported that the sum needed
from unrestricted gifts to the

July 1970 was $880,000. As of
December of last year $570,000
had already been pledged to the

It seems that President W.
Merle Hill of Christian College
in Columbia, Missouri is a bit emr
barrassed over an advertisement
which his college placed in the
colleges in the Midwest. The ad
(appearing in this issue) seemed
to beckon dissatisfied students
to leave their present school and
come to Christian College.
Several college presidents were
reportedly upset over this ap
parent act of “claim jumping.”

In a letter to President Leggett,
President Hill apologized for any
unintended meaning in the ad,
In part, he said: “When I learned
that the ad had been accepted
by a number of relatively small

lections” will open Tuesday (Jan.
20] in the Scheaffer Gallery in
thecollege'sFineArtsCenter.

This exhibition, which replaces
an exhibit of “Contemporary Art
in Poland,” will continue through
Feb. to. The Polish exhibition has
been postponed until the 197071
academic year by the circulating
organization, the American
Federation ofArts.

“The works in this show in-
dicate the scope and breadth of
the college’s growing permanent
and rental collections,” noted
Richard Cervene, professor of
art. “They also reflect a diversity
of style and subject matter that
results in a stimulating and pros
vocative exhibition.”

Among the artists represented
in the exhibition are Pablo
Picasso, Diego Rivera, James
Abbott McNeill Whistler, Karel
Appel, Brian Rice. Ronald King,
Gian Battista Tiepolo, Honore
Daumier, George Bellows, Edou-
ard Vuillard, Kiyoshi Saito,

Mark Sennet intended the movie
to be a vehicle for Marie Dress-

people watch. Another critic says
of Charlie's role in this film: “It
shows how . . . Charlie developed
tlle figure of humor and pathos

ployes chose to represent
them, _

These negotiations are of real
importance not only to the em-
ployees directly involved and to
the union and the college ad
ministration but also to the entire
college community. Their
significance may extend many
years beyond 1970.

(1) because the Teamsters
with whom the college
must negotiate are long
experienced at this
business, and

because the college ad-
ministration is Without
any experience at all in
such matters, and

because we believe that
whatever is done here
ought to be done right,

we have asked Mr. Rogers to
represent the College.

Mr. Rogers has accepted the
responsibility of representing the
College. His instructions are to
do his very best to negotiate a
collective bargaining agreement
which is fair and responsible to
the employees directly involved
and to the entire college com-
munity and its future.

The job of the negotiators is
tough enough wimout being
complicated by the statements of
comments of others. In view of
this and in the interests of
promoting the effectiveness of
the negotiations, we do not intend
to say or do anything outside of
the negotiations which might in
any way have any impact on the
negotiations which might in any
way have any impact on the

residence, in an arena production
of Murray Schlagal’s “The
Typists“ and “The Tiger." This
year he has chosen “The

The Associated Colleges of the
Midwest, as you have all been
told, is an organization devoted
to the pursuit of Good Clean Fun
at the intercollegiate level. It
consists of colleges which send
athletic newsletters to each other
and to the Press. The minute he
gets these Lloyd puts them in my
wire basket, leans hack in his
swivel chair and tells me. Except
on vacations. When I arrived on
Saturday, Lloyd put a month‘s
accumulation in my wire basket,
leaned back, etcetera. Knowing
No Better, 1 opened and read 1
NCAA newsletter, 4 from
Carleton, 3 from Grinnell, 2 each
from Coe and Beloit, and 12 from
Monmouth. There was another
from some tennis organization,
but Lloyd kept that, so you'll have
to ask him if you want to hear
about it,

Just as well for me that I went
through all this trouble, because
it Disencumbered Me Good and
Proper. There is, it seems a
notion abroad among the laity
that sports is made up of roughly
equal proportions of Good and
Bad Teams, and mat the two

mer defeat, trounce, edge, down,
romp over, upset, detenestrate,
or similarly demonstrate their
unbridled superiority over the
valiant, but (alas!) doomed
Latter. Needless to say, I couldn’t
have been further from the truth
if I’d tried. There are neither
Good Teams nor Bad Teams, but
no need to worry. (Where there
remains so little as a Former and
a Latter, there springs Hope in
the pedant’s mind.)

The fact of the matter is that
there are Optimistic teams and
seasoned ones (players 32 years
and older), and that these
regularly encounter and defeat,
trounce. edge, down, romp over,
and upset the Latter, which are
Building Teams (generally

Pioneers Beat
Beloit, Face
Crucial Trip

The Grinnell Pioneer
Basketball team beat Beloit 7560
last Saturday after losing to Coe
the night before. Two weeks ago
the cagers opened conference
play with a road trip to North
field, Minnesota and battled
defending league champion St.
Olaf and then Carleton.

The Pioneers faced a tough
Carleton team and were leading
going into the last few crucial
minutes of the game until the
Carls put on a sudden later game
surge and took the victory away
from the Pioneers, finally win-
ning by seven points, The next
night, Grinnell played an inspired
game against St, Olaf. Grinnell
was forced into overtime before
losing by four points. The Oles
are currently leading the Mid»
west Conference with a 4-0
record. Sophomore center Bob
Burnett played a tremendous
game and led all scorers with
29 points. St. Olaf’s two all»
conference players could not stop
Burnett as he played his finest
game of the season. This road
trip proved that Grinnell is
capable of beating any team in

theleague.

On January 16th Coe invaded
Darby Gym and coasted to a 103-
62 win over the Pioneers,
becoming the first team in the
league to break the century mark
this season. Junior Scott Hanson
and senior captain Don Peterson
led the disappointing scoring with
eleven points each, while
sophomore Greg Bombinski had
ten points.

The next night was a successful
one for the Pioneers, as they
nailed down their first home
conference victory of the young
season. The Pioneers outplayed
Beloit and rolled to a 7560 viri-
tory. Junior Greg Bumbinski
scored 18 first half points and
finished with a game high of 21
points. Hanson and Bombinskihit
double figures again, scoring 17
and 11 points respectively.

Tonight Grinnell plays at
Lawrence against a team which
was soundly beaten by Beloit.
The Pioneers are favored to beat
Lawrence and if they do, they
could go into Ripon with some
momentum and possibly sweep
the road trip. This would give
the basketball team a creditable
.500 record going into a live game
home stand.

Swimmers Easily
Win Relays

By Reggie Graham

The ups and downs of the past
two years have produced an
excellent group of swimmers.
Many of us have come up from
poor to mediocre backgrounds
With the help of Coach Ober-
miller, and we are now a team
of winners. Enough said:
Examine the results of last
week's Grinnell Relays.

The annual invitational affair
was attended by three nonr
conference schools: Wayne State
University, The University of
Northern Iowa, and Luther
College. These are large schools
compared with Grinnell and
usually afford excellent com-
petition. This year Grinnell
produced an outstanding per-
formance. We are in good shape,
just closing out our two weeks
of prersemester, two-a-day
workouts. Our relay teams took
first in eight of the ten events,
placing second in the other two.
In a relays meet such as this one,
swimmers compete in pairs as
teams. Thus, for example, in the
200 yard butterﬂy, Jim William's
and Hal Dale’s times were
combined. Their total being less
than that of any other team, they
won the event, the trophies, and
kisses from the queens (Kathy

New Wrestling

Coach Interviewed

When I went to Darby on
Tuesday afternoon I found
Maurice Hunt in the locker room
with his four~man wrestling
squad. The team was preparing
to leave later that afternoon for
a meet at Wartburg. and there
hadn’t been time to arrange a
trainingmeal.

”Don’t worry,” he said ”a
hungry man is a dangerous
man.” and he sent them off to
the Forum for their training
meal.

Hunt comes from Kentucky
State College (captain of the
football team) by way of Gary,
Indiana’s city school system,
where he taught and coached.
Coaching the wrestling team of
a school with an enrollment of
more than 2,000 (compared to
Grinnell‘s 1180), he guided at
least one of his wrestlers to a
city championship. And all navelr
staring urges aside, it would be
difficult not to wonder what his
reaction to coaching at Grinnell
has been.

Maurice is disappointed,
though keenly sensitive to the
athletic situation at Grinnell, and
hewas willing to talk about it.

First of all, Grinnell does not
have a reputation as the sort of
school at which highly competi-
tive athletes can do great things,
and A c M, regulations prohibit
any recruitment of prospective
students by coaches. So the
college must depend, says Hunt,
on alumni aSSlstance and team
records within the conference.
But alumni of Grinnell tend
towards urban areas, and urban
athletes tend towards large

Abbott and Val Siedert). Records
of the previous Grinnell Relays
have been kept, and several were
broken this year. The 1000 yard
freestyle is a new event for the
relays, and the team of John
McBlain and Mike Daley set a
good mark toward which future
teams can aim. Don Linke and
myself set a new diving record;
Bruce Rollins and Jim Carns, a
record in the 60 yard freestyle.
Rollins and Steve Ward broke the
1000 yard freestyle record, and
the unbeatable distance team of
Daley and McBlain set a new
record in the 500 yard freestyle.
A new 400 yard freestyle relay
record was also set by the team
of Ward, Carns, Chris Freeburg,
and Rollins.

Individually, Mike Daley didn't

schools which can offer the busi-
ness and professional programs
as well as their athletic attentions
and scholarships. Nor can
Grinnell draw to the Same extent
on alumni and organizational
loyalties as can schools like St.
Olaf, forinstance.

Hunt, who also coaches the
football and track teams, feels
that despite these drawbacks, the
college can attract talent in par-
ticular sports by virtue of team
records in these sports. He cites
as an instance the increase in
prospective football players after
last year's winning season.

But no matter how good his
wrestlers, he is dogged by cir-
cumstance and appearances, in
this aspect. The wrestling team
at its full strength will number
five men: Jim Weiser, Mason
Klippell, Washington Alston,
Torn Ratliff, and Chuck Farr. As
a complete team should cover all
eleven Weight classes, Grinnell
must forfeit most matches in dual
meets before they are into their
tights and out of the locker room.

Consider also this: Grinnell is
slated to meet Hofstra next
Wednesday at Iowa City. Hof-
strau is ranked well up in the
top-ten small-college wrestling
teams in the country, and the
Grinnell squad is understandably
nervous about the meet. Hunt,
whilehe feels that this scheduling
is a mistake, thinks that there
is a real possibility of strong
individual performances making
a contest of it. But the fact
remains that a meet like this
tends to discourage the team, and
perhaps more importantly, can
present an erroneous picture of

a meet record. even breaking the
old pool record in the 500 by
swimming a 528.4. 1 scored
213.60 points to get the individual
diving record; Rollins swam a
28.5 second 60 to get the in
dividual record in this event.

Coach Obermiller thinks the
team is in excellent shape, and
is looking forward to a whole
season of meets ending as hap
pily as our relays.

The second dual meet of the
season is Saturday (the first was
with Coe before vacation, and we
won it handily). We face Mons

of excellent teams. They beat us
last year by one point, so we’re

its genuine strengths. This sort
of thing also can inhibit the team
from cashing in, as no doubt the
football team did, on an attrac-
tiVe record, and from good perv
tormances that looked good.

But, given all this, What ac-
counts for the apparent apathy
of Grinnell students towards
varsity participation? Here the
coach was genuinely puzzled. He
pointed out that wrestling, like
track, differs from :rnost coller
giate sports in that'th’e'socus of
blame and attention is on the
individual, and that he has little
chance to cover up mistakes and
inadequacies. 0n the other hand,
he feels that individual compe-
otion has as much as, if not more
to offer a highly motivated
athlete than team sports. Train-
ing is limited to about ninety
minutes a day to find a balance
between conditioning and fresh-
ness,

Hunt’s city champion was a kid
he buttonholed on the basketball
court. who first came on as team
manager and only later wrestled
himself. But of those who signed
up for wrestling at Grinnell, most
did not even appear. And of those
others who show an aptitude for
the sport, but will not come out
for it, he can only shake his head
at their lack of interest.

While conceding that he an-
ticipatcs low team scores in dual
meet competition due to under
staffing, Hunt says that he is
hopeful of strong individual
performances, and with luck and
proper climmations, a chance at
a championship showing at the
Midwest Conference Meet early
in March.
