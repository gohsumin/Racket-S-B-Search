Between the dark and the daylight when the night is
beginning to lower

Comes a pause in the days occupation that is known
as the prepping hour.

And we begin to we .

We have watched Gl nnell grow from an all-Iowa
F, aven for mama’s best darlings to a place which has finally
produced people who find discussion more entertain-
iiig' than wearing tails on their heads, or cans on their tails.
,Vi’e don’t want it to stop here.

We, who have seen change begin, wonder whether
this current all too "groupy" crew can discard their
romantic dreams of college tradition, and embrace instead
the struggle which comes with the new and more difficult
Grinnell iii transition.

Freshmen, won’t you set aside ollr worst fears? Won’t
you identify yourselves? Identify yourselves not by name
and hall on a card hung about your neck like a dog license,
-or by similar heanies on the tops of your heads, but in the
classroom, alid more important outside of the classroom.
identify yourself by your very personal imaginations and
cpinions. Use your student voice.

If you are a political radical; let us know. If a political
conservative tell us that, too. If you are a middle-of—the-
roader let lls know why. Don‘t let your discussion halt in
the classroom and be replaced in the dorm or union with
the old Grinnell quacliery about people instead of ideas.

Bring your individual feeling into the T.V. lounges
to those still caught cohwebbed in the old Grinnell. Most
important, don’t let us tell you who you should be; make
bl. 'e we know who you are.

We. who have grown to respect the broader Grinnell,
the school unai'aritl of “Easterners,” unafraid to accept the
new in people, we plead with you, freshmen to remember
that it i you who can leave Grinnell half-born, or carry
Grinnell still farther along ill progressive patterns set by
the forward looking- lilleral arts colleges

Think, identify yourselves, discuss, speak out, don’t be
prep . allay our fears, prove yourselves up to the
clialle: 'e not only of a fine tradition, but of a finer more
exciting time of change.

Delegates Review

by David Evans

iNSA Congress—Par”

William Halnmu
Cameron Hendershot

The United States National
Student Association is the only
group in the country which can
claim to represent the opinion
or United States students. It was
founded in ism by 350 schools.
Approximately 400 schools are
nor: mcinbcrs.

Constitutionally, tll ultimate
source of power within NSA
is the annual National Student
Congress It is this body which
makes policy [or the coming
ycar in the form of basic policy
declarations and resolutions.
NSA can only speak out on is
sues which directly touch upon
student liic.

The Congress is first divided
into workshops and subwork-
shops Grinnell was represented

at the following: Federal logisa

laticn dealing with higher edu-
cation, educational
with emergent areas, the struc-
‘mrc of student government and
'tlie role of sludcnls in college
policy making.

Workshops are devoted to
an exchange oi ideas rather
than to policymaking. Actual.

open to debate and amendment.
And again, the proposal must be
passed by a majority. However,
'a minority resolution can bc
ipassed on to the Congress with
la 20 per cent vote in both
groups.

This leaves the Congress with
,ovcr a hundred resolutions to
‘consider. In the relatively brief
time during which the Congross
meets it is impossiblc to considc
ler all or even a good number of
thc resolutions. So resolutions
,coming out oi committee are
given priority according to i. “11*
pcrtancc and 2. amount of cons
'troversy.

Thc Cong’rcss begins with
number one and works its way
down the list as far as possi-
ble. Then the delegates refer

they will not bc ablc to con-
sider to the National Execur
tivc Committcc (NEG) for con.

‘is an address by both the presi—
ldcnt of the collcgc and the stu-
dent body president. This
the time when the tone Of the
campus is set. Last year, for»
nler Student Councnl President
Duane Krohnke’s “1960, the
iYear of the Student” address

became the spiritual and in'tcl—l

llectual reference point for ilea
‘ly all non—athletic extra—Currie
ular activities.

Hopeiully, President Bill Hub,

,amc's address will have the
same impact. In View of its i
portance, excerpts from his
lspecch will be prcscntcd and
‘(llscussecl in this column.

It was at the National Cons
gress oi NSA held this summer
where Halama’s thoughts for the

speech tool: shape, He l‘cmal‘ked‘

that he was disturbed by Corn—
lments of a number of foreign
lstudcnts who noticed “a critical
lack of depth and clearly de-
ﬁned direction in United States
student politics.” He was di-
turbed by the truth of
comment.

"The prevailing motive on
American icampuses is—hnvc
fun," nalcma told the fresh-
men, Going iurthcr, he ub-
servcd that this lack oi direc-
tion nnd sense of purpose is
not conﬁned exclusively to
students but is now a nation-
nl trait.

1

American student frustration
is released in the form of thc
chaotic ﬁascoes of Fort Lauders
ldale, Boise, Idaho, and else-
inner-c.

“There can be little doubt."

lhe said, “that it these incidents‘

had occurred in most foreign
‘countries, they would have been
lsuccessiully harnessed to a po-
‘liticnl uprising or , revolution,
‘bllt in the United States they
occurred without a sense at pur-
lposc, I am not advocating a
lpolltical revolution in this counr
,ii-y as an outlet-for student
,irusti-atlon, but 1 am advocating
lan attack on the causes oi this
‘iolly."

“Not all students," said l-lala—
ina, ”are dominatcd by the
haverfun motive, just a major-
ity."

Yet, ”a slowly increasing mi.
nority is beginning to see our
,moral urgcncy and is beginizlng

3 Speaking about Grinnell In
particular, Halama commentcd:
“Unfortunately one of the shoi .
comings of a democracy is that
moral issues are too ortcn reck—
oned with in numbers of votes,
iand our voice is sometimes
small. But I am reminded of
a man who once said, ‘I tun

The implementation oi rc-
sponsible policy in intives
heavily depends upon senator
ial response, It is still too

l the quality at tho Senate.
Certainly the whole complex-
ion of the Senate may change
when the women’s halls elect
their new senators.

vidlng the Senate with good
leaders is questionable. Often,
inhabitants of the South sidc
givc more weight to a candiv
date's smile than to her plat-
form or her competence. If the
high standards we saw in last
year‘s Aws election are sus-
tained in the upcoming sena—'
torial race, we can be assured
or a ﬁne new set of south cam-
pus senators.

President Ilalama pledged to
sustain Kruhnkc‘s efforts to
make student government pro—

well articulated and well rc-

lpoliey depends upon legislative

Dean Wood Views Students life

Gl'innell’s new Dean or Mon,‘
Stephen E. Wood, is presently l
grounding himsclf in the tradi—
tions and working arrangements
of the college. He sees the system
here unique in the amount of
control the student has over his
life and is well aware of Grim,
ncll‘s long history of studentl
government which leaves the re
sponsibility of a great number
of the rules to the students, Yet
he sees that with this respons
bility comes also the responsibil. _
ity of the student to eniorcc the
rules he has made. “1 see no rea—
son for rules that aren't entorc—
ed," he said in an interview this »
