The Grinnell political scene has
returned to normal. After an
astoundingly largeivoter turnout
in last week’s presidential elec-
tion (prompted apparently by the
sore editorial urging a boycott
of the election), this week only
526 students bothered to vote for
:he Council of House Presidents
and the Associated Women Stu-
dents Board presidents.

Bill Thomas was elected presir
dent of the Council of House
Presidents by getting 173 votes
to 93 for Jon Stein and 35 for
Richard Pope. Mary Brooner de-
feated Laurie Levatin, 154 to 71
to become president of the
Associated Women Students.

Grinnell Republican ’Aciion Now’ Models Notional Drive

By PHIL SASlCll
9, On Saturday, March 7, Elly

Peterson, the originator of the
Republican Party’s “Action
‘Now” program, led a task force

a of Republican leaders to Iowa,
Their purpose: to implement a
pilot “Action Now" program
among lowa College Repubr
licans.

Collcgc Republican leaders
irom across the state particir
pated in a series oi panel diSr
cussions about general problems
that “Action Now” hopes to
confront.

Special guests included Senator
Jack Miller-iRep) of lowa who
spoke on “The Environmental
Crisis.” Miller cautioned citizens

to “guard against blind haste in
buying solutions to the many and
very complex aspects oi the
environment." This ratllcr inc
iiocuous toiic characterized the
whole oi his speech

Vigorous exchange developed

perspective. when those con.
scrvative Iowa College Ro-
piiblicans challenged Jack Crow.
iord, Special assistant to the
chairman oi the Republican Na-
lional Committee, Wille Newbit
of Clarinda College, and Russ
Macgregor oi Grinnell on the
racial issue.

The Republican National Com.
mittcc is watching this pilot pro-
gram with great interest. be

cause. ii if is successful. similar
programs will be established in
other slates.

Gold Bond

Just a reminder that the Gold
Bond Stamp Drive sponsored by
the Student Recreation Com»
mission will get into iull swing
iollowing Spring Break. The aim
is a bus which will serve the
transportation needs of the entire
campus community. So, every-
one, please remember while you
are athome to tap your families’,

friends', and relatives supplies

from Raleigh and BelAire

cigarettes.

Interviewed after the election,
Bill Thomas listed some of the
projects he has been working on
and which he will continue to
work on as C. of HP. president.
They include: (1) establishment
of a student»run Crisis clinic for
both drug and emotional prob.
lems; (2) change in the coun-
seling service; (3) dorms that are
fully coed; (4) better organiza-
tion ior payment at hall debts;
and (5) better managementof the
TV fund.

In addition, Thomas said, “I’d
like to see hall presidents take
a more creative role in the
changes on social affairs. C. of
l-I.P. is the one group with cone
tacts all over campus. it is in
touch with people of all lifestyles;
therefore, it can come up with
programs which have the most
widespread support. It hasn’t
taken advantage of this at all this
year."

As for counseling, Thomas had
the following to say: “I mink the
student adviser system should be
retained, although the training
program for S.A.’S could be
improved. I think much more
consideration should be given to
student opinion in the hiring of
R.A.’s and their superiors. An
academic adviser should be
assigned to the same group of
students as a student adviser
because some academic coun:
selling must be done by students
A good thing might be to have
a professor affiliated with each
dorm

0n dorm life; “I’m going to
work for home rule for the dormir
tories. Each hall should consist
of a group of students who rent
that hall from the college.” 0n
Grinnell in general: “In 1964,
Grinnell was a leader not only
in the Midwest but across the
country in social policy. Today.
supposedly more conservative
colleges are moving ahead or us.
The studcnts here are generally
complacent about their living
situation.” _

Mary Brooncr was more
reserved in her interview, but she
advocated that the A.W.S. and

'c of HP. be given more power

in the arca oi social regulations.
“The Senate has too many comr
mittees, and many of the mem-
’iers of this year’s A,W,S. Board
iell frustrated because they
have no power."

In her campaign statement,
she said: “Resources for both
proiessional and personal ad-
vismg arc. at most, minimal and

do not meet the needs of Women
students. The A.W.S. Board

should make it its business to
investigate this area of advising
and to ‘make strong recom-
mendations to the College where
necessary. Further demands also
need to be made concerning the
health needs of Grinnell women.”

Student Power Pro poso]

In this issue appears the proposal of the student
power committee for the establishment of a committee
on curriculum and academic affairs. This proposal,
we are told, is the result of many long and difficult
hours of labor by both students and faculty. The pro—
posal is notable for its relative moderation as compared
to the freenswinging, puerile student manifesto of last
semester. The reason for this may be that the com—
mittee was, in part, composed of‘ faculty members.
Or it may be the case that time tends to make conserva-
tives of us all. Unfortunately, regardless of how moder-
ately we apply a bad principle, we get bad results.
And the principle of student power in academic and
curriculum affairs is very had, indeed.

The committee has carefully made its proposal ac-
cording to a democratic principle. They apparently
believe that because a representative democracy is

» desirable in national government, it is equally desirable
in education. It is not intuitively obvious to us, at least,
that the two situations are identical. The reasoning
behind the committee’s noble intentions leaves a great
deal to be desired. .

The proposal, if accepted, would give students an
equal voice in determining, for example, graduation
and departmental requirements. We would have then
the utterly absurd situation of students who have not
completed their education voting on what would be
needed to complete that education. Let us note that
the proposal does not even exclude freshmen from
voting on the committees.

The faculty will debate and vote on the proposal
sometime after spring vacation. If they vote to accept
it, we believe that they will have taken just one more
step toward the demise of excellent education at Grin»
nell College.

Letters . . .

To Tlle Editors:

In the interest of somewhat
greater accuracy, 1 would like
to make the lollowing two corree
tions of statements which ap-
peared in the article concerning
Cuttington College two issues
ago.

(1) The Colonization Societies
did purchase land from tribal
peoples early in the nineteenth
century, but it was tor the pur-
pose of establishing their settle»
ments. Cuttington College is 120
miles in the interior, and its land
was purchased rrum tribal
peoples in the midrlsso's, as part
at the extensive alienation of land
lrom tribal peoples which began
at that time with the extension
of roadsinto the interior.

(2) The students of tribal back-
ground at Cuttington College
were often educated at missions,
but that does not mean that they

were educated by missionaries,-

Peace Corps Volunteers, Liber-
ian citizens, nationals from other
African nations, EX-PCV'S, and
sometimes ACM graduates, My
point was to indicate that college
students are not recruited from
the government schools for the

most part.
Sincerely yours,
Ronald J. Kurtz
Associated Professor of
Anthropology
To The Editors:

Since l take pains to express
myselt clearly, l seldom reply to
criticisms of my arguments
unless new evidence appears or
new countenarguments are
brought iorward. But my censure
of Mr. Nasser’s review has
roused considerable ire, some of
it from men whom I know and
respect and whose good opinion
I would not willingly iorego.
Hence this reviLy,

'I observe Iirst that not one of
those persons who has called me
such opprobrious names un-
dertakes to say one good word
in behalf of Mr. Nasser's review.
Apparently all believe that it is
enough merely to discredit me.
Such a view contradicts their own
principle 7 that a man‘s views
are irrelevant to his competence.

Second, their method for
discrediling me is exactly that
of which they accuse me:
“personal attack” and
“character assassination." If I
were guilty ct what they assert,
it would be eimer in intent or
in fact or both. Well, since only
i can know my intentions, let me

say, categorically and un-
equivocally, that my censure or
Mr. Nasser’s review was in no
way whatsoever intended to be
a reﬂection on his person or his
character. My argument, in fact,
is this: those who submit to a
body of dogma are to that degree
precluded from having
character, for character is torm-
ed by the sustained and
renewed habit of decision; and
he who submits to dogma abanr
dons his powers at decision.

It would seem that there
are three reasons for the ire
aroused: (l) I used the word
“communist” as being,
possibly a more accurate
description of Mr. Nasser’dt
position than “socialist”; (2) my
statement that Mr. Nasser’s
peculiar mixture of “-isms”
disqualified him for teaching at
a liberal arts college seemed to
be intending civic or legal action
to oust him; (a) the general tone
at my letter was offensive.

To the iirst charge 1 reply that
the Plot of either term 7
“communist" or “socialist" 7
was of minor impormnce to my
argument, which rested on the
meaning of the suffixes “risrn”
and “rist,” If I have caused Mr.
Nasser or other faculty members
undue pain by making a distinc-
tion between “communist”and
“socialist,” I regret it, although
I would argue that the distinction
is a legitimate one. Still, if it will
please Mr. Klein and others for
whom he speaks, I will withdraw
the word ”communist" provided
that Mr. Nasser’s own term
“socialist" be understood to
include advocacy of violence and
revolution, in the manner of the
present governments of Russia
and China: such is what his
review indicates. Until he denies
this interpretation, it seems
legitimate tu make it.

Theater Dance Group Presents
Outstandingly Unified Performance

By RONNIE FULTON

Last Friday and Saturday night
ili Roberts Theater, the' Grinnell
community was treated to an
evening ot excellent dance and
some very good choreography by
the Theater Dance Group, for
inerly known as Orchesis. The
varied program provided an ex-
citingshow for theaudience,

The Theater Dance Group. as
compared with last year‘s group,
has learned to work and dance
as a group. A college dance group
with only a few good dancers
could not have prowded such a
diversified program, The pres
ence of so many new males in
-the performance, noted with
great pleasure, is one factor re-
sponsible for a more cohesive
group,

The first half of the program
was choreographed primarily by
students, “Organic,“ choreo-
graphed by Giti Zarnegar, was
one of the best attempts. The out
standing piece of student
choreography was ”Street Peo-
pie,” danced to music by Cop-
land. and choreographed by Dick
Hartz, Harlz obviously has potenr
tial as a choreographer, In this
number he managed to create
humorous character sketches of
street vendors and young cou-

ples. He knows how to shift the
audience‘s attention from cou-

pla, to individuals, to the group.
The simplicity of the dramatic
elements in this piece made the
story easily understood. Another
student piece, “Character Stud-
ies From Theater,“ would have
profited from a less complicated
plot.

l-lartz’ other example of
choreography was his solo,
“David at Gilboa.” This short,
simple number succeeded in
creating a mood of nobility. Hartz
began the piece with very simple
movements which he later de-
veloped The shadow of his figure
playing on the back wall added
an excellent touch.

Ofall the pieces choreographed
by Mrs. Voertman, “Gnossiena
nes," “Full Circle,” and “The
Last Flower” were most success-
ful “The Last Flower” contained
more acting than dance; how
ever, the audience seemed to
enjoy the humor of the group's
portrayal of such things as rab-
bits and subways. In “Full Cir-
cle,” the story of the jealousies
of two women and a man, Mrs.
Voertman displayed her ability
to combine the serious and the
comic. Nina Seidenman was an

<t‘ser's political

excellent choice for the female
rolc opposite Mrs. Voertman. The
contrast in the shapes of their
bodies and their facial features
complemented the theme of the
struggle between the two women.
“Gnussiennes,” danced by Jenny
Butcher, Elly Dayton, and Sue
Seeder, was one of the most
beautiful numbers in the
program, In this piece Mrs.
Voertmari created a simplicity of
movement, tastefully begun and
resolved. The gracefulness of the
dance was reminiscent of the
style of Martha Graham.

The audience thoroughly en-
joyed the performance. This re-
viewer hopes to See the Theater
Dance Group retain its cohesive
character, and to see Dick Hartz
continue with his ambitious
choreography. Mrs Voertman is
to be commended for her choreo-
graphic ability and her ability to
teach dancers to change thought
into the movement of one body.

LETTERS—
Continued from page 2

Mr. Nasser dictated his own
headline: The Battle of Algiers:
Blueprint for a Revolution.” Mr.
Klein, fighting on my side for the
moment, effectively showed that
Mr. Nasser was guilty of
fallacious historical parallels —
a charge admitted by Mr. Nasser
in his subsequent letter, where
he confessed that his language
had been ”ambiguous.” We know
what“ambiguous” means in such

tts academic jargon
for ”I blew it.”

Such was the only “substantive
contention”i in Mr. Nasser's
article; left over were some
rather chiechi insights (e.g.,

“‘Battle’ has actors, but no act-'
,ing.") and the presuppositions

which underlay Mr. Nas»
philosophy. It
was to these presuppositions that
I addressed myself in my letter.
To the second charge I reply
that I in no way advocate any
kind of institutional or legal
action againstMr. Nasser. Milton
has truly observed that, in a fair
fight, truth will always triumph.
Now despite the unpleasant
names’ which my critics have
called me, however, I do not think
them guilty of bad motives. So
far as I am concerned, they are
men of good will, and I would
ask them to forgive any errors
in tone I may have committed
as I torgive them for their
mistaken attribution to me OI ill

Danny Cox
Sings Again

By NADA MANGIALE’I‘TI

In his third Grinncll ape
pearance last Saturday night,
Danny Cox was again enthusi—
astically applauded for another
fine performance. In the past
year, this campus has seen some
of the folk muste world’s better
flat-pickers. singlerstrlng experts
and three-finger banjo pickers,
but Cox‘ guitar style is the
epitome of three~finger guitar
work. His clean, hard. accurate
picking and masterful familiarity
with the fingerboard reflects his
classical training. The most imr
pressive quality about his unique
style is the apparent. ray-Alps:
ease with which he‘llips off delir
cate trills, harpsichordial
moi-dents and incredible intricate
runs. Cox's voice, big and
resonant to begin with, filled up
the room even more as time went
on.

Cox’s popularity at Grinnell may
also be attributed to his unpre-
tentious manner, warm person~
ality, and quiet humor. He is
perTéctly at home in front ot an
audience and obviously enjoys
himself, with the result that the
audience can do none other than
enjoy him.

To the third charge I reply

means of exposing folly, whether

result of bad art, not ill will. It

Tankmen Win Conference Title Hands Down

By Jim Williams

On Saturday, March 7, 1970, the
Grinnell swimming team walked
away from the Carleton swim-
ming pool with “all the marbles”
as Coach Obermillel' would say.
They had won the Midwest
Conference Championship by the
largest paint spread in the last
8 years. Grinnell tallied up 5']
points with Carleton. the closest
contender accumulating only 49
points. The Conterencetitle dame
as a perfect finish to a perfect
season for Grinnell’s swimmers.
They won 7 of the 11 events,
setting 2 and tying 1 Conference
records, and establishing 7 new
pool records and 5 Grinnell school
records in the green, wavy
Carleton tank. Every man on
Grinneil's squad turned in a good
ettort under the intense two days
of pressure. The statistics of the
meet ran as follows:

400 yd. Medley Relay: 1.
Grinnell 5:57.15, pool record:
(Brammer, McKean, Williams,
Carns).

100 yd. Freestyle: 2. McBlain

you can not afford to be without

It you are tired of the partici-

want to miss the ideas in The
Internationalist Perspective. If
you want to preview the concepts
of the next century instead of
hearing sterile repetittons of the
last century‘s cliches, you can
tind solid loud for thought in the
pages of The Internationalist
Perspective.

Our literature would be
of particular interest to students

himself, when he unleashed his
6’6” body in two fantastic efforts
to dominate the breaststroke in
the meet.

Before this outstanding climax
to the season, Grinnell had won
every dual meet by at least 20
points, won the Knox relays, the
Grinnell Relays, and the Viking
Olympics. This pertect un-
defeated record is the first such
varsity feat in 10 years of
Grinnell athletics. It is
reasonable to say that this year’s
swimming team is probably one
of the finest athletic teams
Grinnell has ever fielded. If team
spirit, closeness, hard Work, and
victory are indicative of great-
ness, then it is definite that the
1970 Swimmers are No. 1.

What pulled this team to Vic-
tory? The answer is simple and
deeply ingrained in each
swimmer. It is true respect and
admiration for Coach Raymond
J. Ohermiller, better known as
Obe (O-bee). Each swimmer and
diver has dedicated himself to 31/2
months of total physical
exhaustion and mental tensi .

Workaouts this year totaled 165
miles or 14,5201engths of die pool,
and 1,200 pushups and situps.
Most of the team practiced twice
a day throughout a major part
of the season, including 2 weeks
of Christmas vacation. Through
all the exhaustion, lack of am-
bition and depression, that
naturally built up, only one thing
kept the team together and
pushing —Obe. In a team
meeting of 15 dead tired and
scared swimmers the night
before the Conference finals, the
team unanimously dedicated
themselves to Win the Conference
for Obe’s first big swimming
title. They did it and then carried
him around the pool chanting
”Ohe, Obe, Obe. . .l” This team
worked hard and earned every
victory and now we would like
to dedicate the whole season as
a tribute to the one who Worked
the hardest 7 Che! He is No.
