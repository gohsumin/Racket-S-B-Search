TheftProhieln innovated On Campus

By MICHAEL BRANDON

Grinnell College is losing thousands or
dollars R year due to theft, and in many
instances students are the culprits. Each
year thousands of volumes disappear
from Buriing Library, hundreds or dol-
lars Worth of silverware is taken from
the dining halls, large amounts of mer-
chandise are shoplitted from the College
Bookstore, and numerous items are
stolen from lounges, offices and resi-
dence hau rooms on campus

Must College officials are hesitant
about blaming students for missing pro-

perty and are reticent about reierring
to petty piliering by students as “theft.”
“The thing that bothers me,” said Col<
lege Treasurer Donald Lanibie in a
telephone interview, “is that 1 hate to re-
fer to it as ‘student theit,’ I prefer to
call it ‘College or student losses."'
Despite the loot that “outsiders” are
responsible to some degree for stolen
property on campus, quite clearly it is
a substantial portion ol the student body
that is accountable. ”It's really a shame
and it bothers me greatly," Lambie said.
“In a sense the student who steals is
stealing ironi himself by diverting mon-

ey that could be used to provide him with
a better education,"
Students Discuss Exploits

Many students apparently feel that they
are doing nothing unethical when they
steal from the College. Several students
who were interviewed recently spoke
boastfully and with great candor about
their shoplifting exploits in the College
Bookstore.

One couple that was interviewed esti-
mated that they stole several hundred
packs of cigarettes lrorri the Bookstore
last Semester alone. “We just stick a
couple of packs in my pocket or her

purse, take an extra pack alld pay {or
it to avoid suspicion, and walk out," tho
boy laughed, explaining that he "can't
afford to buy cigarettes every day."
Asked if he ever telt guilt about taking
cigarettes, he paused for a moment and
answered, “Very little.

One girl who was interviewed has an
entire bookcase in her room filled with
books she said she stole from the Book
store. she estimates their value at
“around seven hundred dollars." Accord-
ing to the girl, she, her boyiriend, and

Large turnout votes in referendum to retain student government.

Senate Okays Primary and CBS Fast

in principal action taken Wednesday
night, the Senate set today as the date
for the son. Presidential primary (the
final election to be held Monday, March
10), designated the Concerned Black
Students as the recipient of the spring
fast money, and initiated action to de-
clare S.G.A. President Tom Thomas king.

The Senate set April 4 as the date
[or the spring fast. Ernest Weston, presi.
dent of C.B.S., told the Senate that this
date, one year from the death of Dr.
Martin Luther King, would coincide With
a proposed Black Weekend, to he held
at Grinnell in commemoration of Dr.
King,

other proposals for use of the fast
money had included donating it to the
participants in the Playboy demonstra-
tion, for them to use to defray legal
costs, After the fast action was finalized,
the Senate voted to set up a soup kitchen
for students returning from spring break
on Sunday, March 30. Proceeds will be

wan to the Playboy demonstrators.

he Senate also allocated $50 to AWARE.

In other C.B.S, activities, Weston re-
ported that present senior Howard Ward
has been hired as a partrtime Admis-
sions recruiter tor next year. A Black
couple is also being sought to work as
full-time admissions personnel, Weston
also told the Senate that he would be
present at a trustees meeting to be held

over spring break to discuss the ap-
pointment of a Black trustee.

News from the Student Affairs Com
mittee included the decision to limit the
number of students moving off campus
to approximately 100 again this yearl
The major reason for this restriction
seemed to be the economic necessity of
keeping 1,000 students in the dermis
tories. Plans for the possible conversion
of Loose Hall to o co-ed hall next year
were also disclosed.

During a final tlurry ol Senate busi-
ness, Senator Dan Cheifetz, commenting
on the inability of town students to at-
tend Forum events, said, “If I were a
townie, I’d be burning this place down."

In a massive ‘Vote of confidence’, the

ed that the purpose of the referendum .

was not accomplished. She made the
following statement, “The purpose of the
referendum was to motivate students
into questioning the relevance of SGA
as it now exists. I believe the student
reaction was mostly superficial and few
gave real thought to the purpose and es-
sentiaiity of SGA.”

Mike Sehestedt feels that the refer-
endum was in actuality brought about as
a personal reaction by the senators who
felt they were unappreciated by the stu-
dent body. He also stated that the refer-
endum was triggered by a lack of con<
cern about the presidential election and
the results indicated "no great passions
are being stirred by the election."

It is the opinion of this reporter that
the resounding ‘No’ vote does not necess-
arily represent student confidence iii the
present SGA structure. It does not nec-
essarily express a beliel that student
government has a definite purpose of
which students are aware. it may in
fact represent a vague fear that a stu—
dent body wnhout a student government
would exist in a state of chaos.

There is also the possibility that the
vote is merely a manifestation of a

 

Committee Discusses Housing Options

The Student Affairs Committee met
Tuesday, March 4 to continue discussion
oi the use of offcampus college owned
houses, the number at students able to

ther changes in the dormitory structuro
for next year.

The Students Affairs Committee is
now receiving written applications for
the use of olfacampus collegerowned

dents living on campus necessitates more

gradual change within dormitories, the
off-campus houses offer great potential
for innovative living learning experi<
ments. The number of students able to

to a large extent, on the proposed en-

common belief that student governlneni
serves as some apparent communication
channel, although it also seems that
many students realize that in a school
the SlZe of Grinnell, individuals can meet
with faculty and administration without
the representation of a student govem
ment,

The 'no‘ vote might in fact be an in-
dication that few students gave the
question more than superficial thought
and that even the fairly sizeable ‘Yes‘
vote was only a reaction against the
present senate, rather than a meaning
in! question of student government’s ace
tual purpose.

It may be the case that not even a
referendum has caused any real thought
as to the purpose and relevance oi SGA.
If this is true, then SSA seems doomed
to another year with an apathetic stun
dent body.

Black Artist To Give
One-Woman Show

At 8:00 tomorrow night in Robert:
Theater, actress Vinie Burrows will pros
sent her onewoman show, “Walk To-
gether Children," a chronicle of th-
American Black experience consisting of
a wide range ol prose, poetry, and spirit-
uals. Miss Burrows describes the past
and present conditions of the American
Black man, including, among other se-
iections, both the delicate wit and beauty
of Langston Hughes and the indelicato
pain of lemi Jones. Miss Burrow's
performance received rave reviews dur-
ing her three week engagement at the
Greenwich Mews Theater in New York
last fall, where she was described a:
“magnificent," “captivating," “gutsy,
lunny, ironic, apocalyptic , . . " Misl
Burrows is a veteran of Broadway, offs
Broadway, television, and radio, and
Grinnell is fortunate to have the oppor-

S.P.K. ’69, searching for relief.
The Feminine Mystaque

This weekend, each Grinnell co-ed will be given permission
to alleviate the tension and frustrations of an entire semester's
abstinence by inviting the gentleman of her choice to any of a
number of campus activities. I, for one (unliberated woman that
I am) would like to conditionally thank the Social Coordinator
for making it possible for me to take this initiative,

Liberated women may rant and rave about the female’s
equal, responsibility in promoting and securing interpersonal re-
lationships, but I, along with all but a small radical fringe on
this campus, believe sillcerely that a Grinnell woman‘s place is
in the dorm, and that she should emerge only when asked or in
case of serious emergency (fire, flood, trips to Planned Parent—
hood). This unassuming, unwilling, and inhibited role was good
enough for my grandmother, and it’s good enough for me, by

all .

g yLet them tell me this way is unnatural, impersonal, outa
moded, and inhuman, let them tell me I am bound by insensitive
social restrictions which make meaningful inter-sexual communi-
cation difficult. Let them tell me this is a kind of social role play-
ing whose abolition is long overdue, and that Sadie Hawkins is
alive and well in Conference House. Let them talk. You know and
I know that if a woman assumes partial responsibility for the
initiation of a relationship, she must also assume partial respon—
sibility for that first date and, God forbid, the second — and we
don’t want that, do we? It strikes me that even one Women’s
Weekend per semester is too much, especially for underclass-
women—perhaps we need a graduated system whereby freshman
ladies would have no Women’s Weekend, sophomores 1 per year,
juniors 1 per semester, and seniors whenever they happened to
feel mature and daring enough. In this way we could insure the
continuation of women’s inferiority, to the great relief of most
of our consciences

And despite the tremendous initial success of the Younkers
Experiment (which I believe was initiated by the SDS), despite
the fact that this natural and relaxed sexual integration seems
to have made the Grinnell social scene more comfortable and
normal, I believe this move foreshadows a breakdown of tradi-
tion which can only lead to increased immorality and perversion.
I call for a return to abnormalcy, and re-institution of campus
segregation, a resumption of feminine irresponsibility.

With luck and a little bit of medical assistance, the women
of Grinnell may survive this weekend. I only hope and pray
that they exercise caution and control, and that they consider
thi - to take initiative is to be human. And we don’t want that,
do we?

talk of the town

by iredricka nelson

last week neil and i set out on a mom-
lhg walk that carried us a little way
physically, and a long way from here
in our minds. we started like children
down ille back alley and encoumered
Vanesa and geni‘ge cat. we passed the
lime ol day with them and then took a
right turn rhal lead us past me salon
oi mr. ielix, across commercial street,
then down the alley between old city
hall and the park hotel. the buildings
were distinguished in their day, but
have been evacuated, rejuvenated, re<
evacuated and lmally padlocked against
whatever youth might have the curiosi-
ty to make them live again.

city hall has old lire—truck doors that
seal up old engines that are still bright
red, and good to dream upon or re-
member. Santa used to come to the old
hall before he gol busy with the super-
market chains and street corner cir-
culls of holiday gaiety. the lines uf chil-
dren in the old station were always too
long when you arrived, but slowly they
would usher you to a redriaced and
plump masquerading saint where you got
a brown paper sack or apples, oranges
and hard candy. the station was cav-
emous—or you were so small a and
seemed to wind endlessly belore releas-
ing you into the december snows again;
there friends would divvy-up candy or
engage in a snowball battle, depending
on where mommy and daddy were.

neil and i spent some time peering
through those old doors and windows
on the side, trying to realize just exact—
ly what was lnslde. i spotted neon signs
along disconnected onesiadvertlsing a
business that’s new set up on broad
street in hum of the alley um runs past
the slauon. they showed you a cool
hamm’s or a frothy budweiser swimmlng
in pinks and bluesmil lights are set
glowing by age and memories. (?)
(we pondered thlngs like that on the
way).

the station was much too conspicuous
and we scuttled around its back corner
to the trough oi the rock island rail-
road. three sets ol track run through
town in that block, maybe even laur.
but the closest one to us was occupied
by two rusting hulks or railway history
from “not so long ago.“ one was a flat
Car and the umer appeared to have
been a caboose of unusual size. the flat

Maril: Reiuvendle SGA

By LEE MARIL

A deﬁnite gulf exists between Student
Government and the students it sujr
posedly represents. But the question is
not whose fault this condition is but.
rather what can be done now. The sug<
gested abolishment of the Senate is not
a logical remedy and faintly smells, in
fact, of our most recent witch-hunt.

Instead ol abolishing Student Govern-
ment, should we not consider enlarging
Its lunction? Should We not consider mak-
ing student government a true govern-
ing body by and for the students, not
merely a service organization? The
basic foundation of such a structure
has already been laid; for example,
there are now numerous student posi»
Lions on faculty committees.

in order for the potential of Student
Government ro be realized many students
must become actively involved. Grin-
nell has always seemed to lack informed
and interested students; the mythical
involved student who participates in stu-
dent government remains a ﬁctional part
of Grinnell life. It is up to the student
government to create interest and in-
volvement in student power, and it is up
to the student body to respond to these
attempts. Both the inability of the pre-
sent Student Governmem on arouse in-
terest pad, in turn, the student body’s
failure to respond are equally responsi-
ble ror or present situation.

The answer lies in Student Govern-
menl's ability lo stop feeling sorry in:
itself; wmmit itself to developing behel-
communication with the student body;
and devote itself to expanding its in-
tluenoe. A! the same time, “uniﬁed
students must give Student Government
a push in the right direction; they must
do more ’lhln vocalize their distrust and
hostility. But if this pm: is to like
the {arm 0! a witch-hunt, regardless or
who turns out to be the witch, then the
concern for a viable Student Government

Proiest Condemned

Prolessor Milner’s article in last
week's 5&3 dealt with the recent demon<
stration by some thnnell students pro-
testing the appearance on campus or a
representative troin Playboy magazine.
Mt. Brice Draper, the Playboy represen-
tative, had been invited to the campus by
a resident advtser acting [or what is
left of the student Sex Education Come
nuttee as a part or its continuing pine
gram or sex education. The protesters
were, then, demonstrating against part
of an educational program initiated and
directed by fellow Students.

The protest took the tollowing form:
some nine or ten students marched in“)
one or the hall lounges, where other
students had gathered to hear Mt. pia-
pcr's presentation and to ask him ques-
tions; then interrupted the orderly and
legal proceedings by singing a song, to
the accompaniment ot a guitar; then

several 01 them molt of! their clothes.’

After this action, they joined the other
students in questioning the speaker.

Professor Mlllier's article centers on
the dismhlng as the central feature at
the demonstration; and e to judge tram
the accounts in newspapers — this tea-
ture is the one which has most caught
public attention. I should like to pmnt
out that the nudity was only one purl of
ii larger action, and it is that action
which ought to be considered beiore pass-
ing yudgnient. But iust as the action did
not consist merely of drsrobing, neither
can it be Classified merely as a demoli-
stration. Protesting demonstrations can
take many iornis, and it is the partlcu<
lzir form of this demonstration that
needs comment.

The action oi the demonstrators was
the interruption cl proceedings which are
at me essence of an educational insti-
tution: the presentalion of ideas and the
suhiection oi those ideas to scrutiny Any
interruption of such proceedings is a
denial oi the idea of liberal education,
and it is this charge that ought to he

if they had not taken [hair clothes off,
they would have been guilty; the nudity
was only an extreme torm at their
antirintellectualism.

That so-called “Playboy philosophy" is
unworthy oi rational attention 15 almost
seltevident; still, every dog deserves
his day, even it Lhe dog he a bitch. The
action of the demonstrators was identi-
cal to that oi reactionary thinkers in pre-
vtous generations, who thought that Com»
muliist speakers should he kept trom the
campus. The colleges and universities of
the when led a long hard fight to Win the
principle or the “open campus" 7 and
yet, just when they have nearly won that
tight, they are being attacked by the
very people for whom they waged the
right: the students.

Far too much time has been spent de-
bating either the motives oi the demon-
strators at the consequences of their ac-
tion. Neither is relevant. bet us grant
that their motives were good — dubious

Apathy Solution Offered
To the Editor:

In recent weeks our college community
has been discussing the problem of stu-
dent apathy. This discussion reached its
pinnacle at last week's open senate
meeting; however, few constructive
ideas were presented. If students are
going to break out of this stifling apathy,
they will have to do it themselves, I
do not feel that the faculty through
sweeping curriculum changes, or student
government however sterling the lead-
ership, can adequately combat the prob-
lem. In order to find an answer to this
problem, other alternatives must be ex-
plored.

in discussing this problem with varl<
ous faculty members, administrators,
and students, I have reached several
conclusions. Many students who are dis-
satisfied with the academic Side of the
college withdraw into their bacchanalian
oriented hall life, They accept the edu-
cation that is given them, rather than
criticizing that education and asking:
what am 1 paying $3300 a year for?
Little effort is made to relate the stu-
dents‘ education to their own lives and
the world in general.

Therefore, i propose a purposeful hall
existence, centering around a student
awareness of his education and all of
its applications. An example or this type
of hall life would be a hall composed of
heterogenous people with diverse views,
making a unified attempt to use their
education to better understand and cope
with problems, both here and outside
of Grinnell. A program to implement
this proposal might include activities
such as: (1) a freshman program de-
signed to immediately instill into the
new student a sense of purpose in his
education, through increased interest by
upperrclassmen in the new student’s in-
tellectual development, (2) formal and
informal discussions Wlthin the hall
dealing with contemporary problems.
(ll) regularly scheduled formal and in-
formal discussions with professors speak-
ing to specific topics rather than Grin-
nell in general. (4) the use of hall funds
to obtain films and outside speakers.

Lately, there has been an overabun-
dance of unproductive rhetoric. Here is
a viable proposal which can be easily
implemented. Any constructive ideas or
criticisms would be greatly appreciated.

consisted of one can of rotten tuna fish,
one pair of sunglasses, and two old
socks suitable for threatening. Since that
time my revolutionary stockpile has
grown to tremendous size and the smell
of tuna ﬁsh reigns supreme As the pos—
sibillty of meaningful revolution has in
recent weeks increased to immeasur-
able proportions, my anxiety over past
misdeeds has led to many sleepless
nights. It is therefore because of my
extreme guilt that 1 confess:

I do hereby confess that it was I who
was responsible tor the rain during the
1957 graduation ceremonies; it was I
who paid off the Grinnell basket-
ball team; it was I who designed the
swimming pool; it was I who posed as
a public relations expert and sold the
idea or the new gym to iaculty and ad.
ministration, and yes, I must hereby
admit, it was I who was directly respon-
sible for the referendum to abolish stu-
dent government.

After receiving my orders from Fe-
king, 1 manipulated the already estab-
lished and booming SDS chapter to
make over the student senate. After two
years or ground work I tinally achieved
my aims; students flocked t0 SDS in
hopes of ﬁnding a haven from that ter-
rible jazz music which pleases the sav-
age tastes of Gary Giddins. (It was I
who corrupted these musical tastes of
this innocent young student.)

I know that! have done terrible things
and I now repent for my past acts. I am
indebted to that brilliantly, perceptive,
concervative (7) student who, during
last Thursday’s senate meeting, re-
vealed the senate conspiracy. I am, be
have me, truly sorry for what I have
done. i know, now. that having con-
fessed my terrible deeds, Grinnell chm~
pus will return, after four long and
hard years, to a normal college environ-
ment tree of outside agitation.

Forever yours,

Seniors Unrealisiic About Draft

Several members of the Grinnell Draft
Information Center inteerewed a few
male students about the draft and the ef—
iect it is having on their thoughts and
lives. We didn’t conduct a study — just
twelve interviews with twelve students,
but some insights into how most Gritt-
nell students are thinking of handling the
draft can be gained.

The draft weighs heavily on most
men’s minds, when they think about it,
but in the way that most of us handle
constant problems, they seemed to avoid
thinking about it realistically or tried
to treat it as lightly as possible.

Most students are uptight enough about
the Army that they are willing to seal:
special deierments beyond the 11-3 rath‘
er than accept their induction easily.
Out of the twelve, whose political atti-
tudes seemed to cover a iairly broad
range, three were hoping for physical
defennents, two were going to apply for
Conscientious Objector’s status, one was
going to medical school, one to the
Peace Corps, one was planning on
Canada before he’d accept the Army.
one preferred to enlist, and the other
two were very indeﬁnite about their
plans.

What most people need to reallze, from
a Counselor's viewpoint, is I) that many
of the deferments people are seeking
are not mandatory — that things like the
Peace Corps are not necessarily defer-
oble, and 2) that records that quality
a person for most of these determents
need to be built up over a period of time.
last minute filing for co. status is very
risky; likewise, relying on the physical
exams at the induction center probably
won’t win anyone a IV-F physical or
mental deferment.

Documentation for physical and men-
tal cases should be built up over B nun)»
ber of years and it may take time to
contact all your old doctors and have
them send copies of your files. C. or
terms need to show some history oi
some religious training and thought that
has led to your belief. All this takes some
careful consideration over several
months’ time.

It's sad that the weight of proving you
don’t want to hilt people or have any-
thing to do with an institution whose big-
gest business is killing, lies with the in-
dividual. The task of seeking counsel-
ling, learning the regulations on your life,
paying for lawyers, and of course, bear-
ing the mental burden, lies with the per-
son who doesn't want to kill any Viet-
namese or support anyone in that
‘duty." The law requires that men par-
ticipate in these activities, and there is
little hope for that law being changed in
time for this group oi Grinnell students
to legally escape that participation.

A lot of work must. be done by those

} Theft

Continued from Page 1

another male Student Shopliited frequent-
ly from the Bookstore last year, and en-
gaged in ”sort of an understood game to
see who could steal the most and in the
neatest way." The girl said that steal-
ing from the Bookstore and dimng halls
is “fun,” and added that she steals books
for other students at their request. she
explained diat she feels no guilt about
stealing from "rich people and institu«
tions," but that she wouldn't steal from
“another student or a very small busi‘
nessmn.” The girl claimed that she
also shoplifts from stores in downtown
Grinnell, and that her contempt lor‘ the
private property concept is in part
responsible for her actions. Throughout
the interview she spoke cheerlully, but
her mood became less jovial when she
noted that she is sometimes apprehen—
sive about being caught in the act of
stealing.

Another male student who was inter-
viewed conlldentially disclosed a method
by which he steals several gallons or
milk a week from SAGA Food Service
without it being missed. “SAGA screws
me by making me pay ior meals I don’t
eat, so I don't care about Stealing from
them. Besides, most of the milk is for
my Cat, and I can't afford to buy it,” he
explained. He said that he also steals
clothes from the Athletic Department
and contended that “most of the other
jocks do, too." He added that he ieels no
guilt about stealing from SAGA or the
College because “with institutions the
loss is so spread out."

A different student shoplifter comment-
ed that "the Bookstore makes big pro-
fits and screws students.” He said that
he once went into the Bookstore with
five dollars to buy a paperback text-
book, but the eleven dollar price so out-
raged him that he stole the book instead.

some students use special coats to
make shop"ing from the Bookstore
easier than it already is. One boy has a
special trencheoat with large pockets
that can easily hold books. Another
student has made a slit in the lining of
his winter coat to form a concealed
packet which facilitates shoplirting large
merchandise from the Bookstore.

It is impossible to ascertaln exactly
how much the College Bookstore loses
annually us a result bi theft. Treasuicr
Lamlbie noted that “losses from the
Bookstore are consistent.” and cited ciga-
reties and candy as the items which weve

particularly vulnerable to theit. Samuel
Wassom, manager at the College Book»
store, said he realizes that there is “some

' student theft,” but he doesn’t think “a

great portion" of studenis steal from the
store.

Wassom said that inventories of the
Bookstore taken at the end of each fis-
cal year always show “some shrinkage,"
but pointed out that some 01 that “shrinlb
age" could be attributed to mark-downs
and sales during the year. He reinsed to
say how much “shrinkage" the Boole
store usually Sutlers. Asked to estimate
roughly the store's losses due to sh0p<
lifting, Wassom said that he couldn't.
but he noted that variety stores in dowfk
town Grinnell estimate their loss at about
two percent.

Wassom pointed out that when the
Bookstore was relocated in Carnegie

basement in 1960 several steps were talk
in to prevent shoplifting from the store,
including the installation or mirrors and
turnstyles “to force people leaving the
store to pass by the cashiers," ln addi~
tion, students who enter the Bookstore
are asked to leave books and other per-
sonal belongings on a shelf near the door.
“We Watch and try to be alert," Wassum
added.

No students have been caught shoplift-
ing recently in the Bookstore, according
to Wassorn. Asked what actions are tak-
en when a student is caught stealing an
item, he replied, “I get them to pay for
it."

cording to College Librarian Henry AL
den, although he doesn't like to refer to
students as ”thievﬁ." He estimated that
the Library loses “thousands 01 volume:
a year,”

Alden recalled that guesswork follow-
ing an inventory six years ago indicated
that the Library lost soon a year in
stolen books, and he pointed out that
book prices have nearly doubled since
then. The Library has abandoned the
policy or yearly inventories for economic
reasons, but the staff continues to make
spot-checks occasionally.

if Alden is correct, the problem shows
no signs of disappearing. For example.
he said, the Library acquired the very
expensive Encyclopedia or Social Science
just six weeks ago, and already three
volumes are missing. He pointed out that
the “taking" 01 reference books by Stu-

dents is unnecessary, because when a
special request is made. they can often
be checked out.

“Many books disappear and come
back, Alden continued, “but others
don't.” He thinks that many students
“borrow" books but either carelessly or
deliberately tail to Check them out, mak-
ing it impossible to locate the books when
another student requests the same ones.
He believes that “only a small number
of students actually steal books from the
Library,” although “occasionally a stu-
dent deliberately takes a book to pre-
vent another student with whom he is
competing ior grades lrom using it."

Alden said the Student Government
Association launched an active campaign
to cut down lib rat ry theft five
years ago. He said it entailed discussing
the problem in house meetings and pro-
viding boxes for the return of all books
at the end of the semester. ”It's more a
matter or depending upon a student’s
sense of responsibility to his fellow stu<
dents than on his responsibility to the
College" Alden believes

He said that it costs nearly five dol-
lars to order and process a book be-
{are it goes on the Library's shelves, in
addition to the book's cost. “But it's not
only ihe money." he elaborated. “Many
books in the library are out of print and
irreplacable when they are stolen."

Alden sees no way oi preventing theft
{rpm the Library except to appeal to
the siudents' sense of conscience. “It's
not the runction or a library to provide
mounted guards to frisk people," he
asserted, and pointed out that techniques
such as turnstyles and magnetic detec-
iion devices to prevent library theft are
very expensive and easily foiled by sni-
dents who want to steal books. The Lie
brary's most Valuable books, which are
mainly early publications or the College,
are kept locked in a vault in Burling
basement to prevent their theft or dear
ti-uction.

One of the most daring thefts at Grin-
hell in reoent years was the purlaining
of the President’s Medallion from it:
showcase in Burling last year during the
middle of the night. The Medallion was
recovered several days later in the Li-
brary, and its disappearance was attri-
buted to student pranksters who had hid-
den in the building until after closmg
timer Alden observed that the Medallion
should never have been on display in
Burling (“This isn’t a museuml”), and
speculated that ihe theft probably in—
fluenced the decision to remove the
display permanently.

“There are also severe losses from
students tak'ng silverware from the
dining halls according to Treasurer
Lamble. Missing silverware had to be
replaced twice last year at a cost or
between five and Six hundred dollars.
Clarence “Saga Chuck" Hand, Food Sere
vice Director. said that silverware, salt-
shakers, ashtrnys and dishes must be
replaced often because so many students
take them from dining halls. Hand said
that the students eventually have to pay
for the stolen articles through increased
board lees. Hand explained that he is
periectly willing to lend surplus utensils
to students who ask to borrow them.

Trend To “Dis-Credit" ROTC

' Recently, a number of univer-
Iities, including Harvard, Yale.
Princeton, and Stanford, have
discontinued the granting of
academic credit for ROTC
programs. Waning interest in
ROTC programs has been evi-
dent across the nation. A 10%
drop in enrollment has been
noted for fiscal year 1969 alone.

Declining to follow the na—
tiooal trend, the Grinnell ROTC
enrollment has increased 15%
(mm {our years ago, reports
Capt. Purdon'l, commanding of-
ﬁcer of Grinnell AFROTC. In an
interview. Purdom expressed
the view that while the
suspension of the ROTC pro-
gram is “probably" a trend, it
is not one that will “sweep the
country.” in tact, AFROTC
alone is planning to add 15 more
detachments in the next year,
he said

Capt. Purdom reacted to
the questioning of the program
by stating that it is periectly
compatible with the aims and
goals of liberal arts education.
Purdom stated that the U.S.
defense establishment n e e d S
"articulate and intelligent" men
to understand all the problems
ol politics and the world, in»
cluding the needs of human be-
ings. He cites the college bulle-
tin as stating that Grinnell is
concerned with “exact habits of
investigation, c o m m u n i c a-
tion, intellectual integrity. and
a clear understanding oi the re-
lationship between thought and
decision, between action and
consequence." Pllrdom explain-

ed that these are the mutually
supportive goals at both the col-
lege and AFROTC heret

Purdom was opposed to both
In a kin g AFROTC mandatory
and to cutting academic credit
from the ROTC program. A
mandatory program would put
"road blocks" to the high qual<
ity oi the courses and give
course loads too large to in—
terested students. Remov-
ing academic credit would put
the ROTC on an extracurricular
level which would make it di-
rectly competitive with sports.
newspaper, and theatre activi-
ties.

Objections to the AFROTC
program's present status in»
clude the argument that “the
force of ideals” is the key
phrase in the college bulletin.
ideals are antagonistic to the
Iorce or weapons, iollows the
argument. David Lindblom, a
junior who opposes ROTC,
stated that the military is a
force which allows the U.S. to
exploit people all over the
World. Grinnell College involve-
ment with ROTC means com-
plicity with exploitation and
murder, he feels.

Having taken an introductory
ROTC course, Lindblom de-
scribed lt as “incredibly simple
minded” and limiting in its
viewpoint. Lindblom questioned
whether the limited and unques-
tioning nature or the program
could be considered in sym-
pathy with the standards at the
college and the goals or a lib~
eral arts institution.

Cidget Goes To The Grinnell Sweatshirt Shop

By GARY GTDDINS

i know that rm not the only
student who, on arriving as a
ireshman here, was completely
grossed out by what passes as
the Grinnell College Book Store.
After two and a halt years at
discussing that anti-intellectual.
antireducationol hole in the
basement of Carnegie, and after
two and a halt years oi hitching
to Iowa City or Des Moines to
get a book or magazine, several
students including myself have
decided that there has been
enough talk and that something
should be done. Briefly then.
here are eight suggestions ior
rectiiying a major problem in
the “Grinnell Experience.” I!
we can't, at the very least. proA
voke an immediate discussion
between Mr. Wassan and sev-
eral {acuity and student repre-
sentatives, then we recommend
that you thumb through your
old SErB‘s and reread Susan
Kaeser’s manual on taking over
college buildings.

L All texts and hard cover
books should be sold at 20%
below the publisher’s price. IT
Bookmaster’s, etc. can stay in
business selling at a discount
then an allegedly non-proﬁt
book store should be able to.

2. Magazines or intellectual
merit should be stacked. Varsity
is line if you like “Busty" or
“Plump Knees" but where the
hell in Grinnell can you get,
without subscribing, copies of
the Paris Review, the New
York Review, the Swanee Re-
view, Saturday Review. and

New Yorker, Evergeen, the
Realist, I. r. Stone‘s Weekly
etc. I’m sure that at the very
least, live copies of each could
be sold regularly.

3. The bookstore should stock
a tow copies of books or popu-
lar and/or scholarly interest
that are published currently.
For example, this year alone,
there were new publications or
new translations of such impor-
tant writers as Bellow. Malraux,
ilesse, Kosinski, Barth, Berry-

.man, Arendt, etc. it the First

Circle and Wellmr Culture
weren't being used as texts,
they wouldn’t have been ordered
either,

Lin order to expand the
stock it would probably be nec-
essary to expand space or at
least redeem-ate the store. Pos<
sibilities: use part of the stor-
age room; get rid of the over-
priced cosmetics; use a class-
room in ARH. There are other
possibilities which need to be
discussed.

5. Let students work in the
store on the same salary set up
that the library works under.
The book store should be {or the
students and the students can
use the jobs. (For examples at
how this and some of the other
ideas in this list might work,
check the Antioch book store.)

6. There should be a commit—
tee consisting oi one proi and
one student from each depart-
ment to discuss what books
should he ordered that are re-
lated to course texts, but aren't
assigned. For instance, in a

4-lelier Words
Slall CBS Paper

The printer of The Brother-
hood, the Concerned Black Stu-
dents’ newspaper. balked about
printing the last issue of the
paper, but ﬁnally yielded to
pressure by several ces mem-
bers and printed it.

The manager of Grinnell 01'.
iice Supply, Robert Anderson,
said that he has had no qualms
about printing past issues or
The Brotherhood, but that he
objected to the use at “tour-
letter words" in the 11105! re-
cent issue.

"I told them I would preler
not to print it,” Anderson told
the SGtB. “I don’t use those
words myseli, and that’s the
same reason I wouldn’t run an
ad in Plerndactyl.”

Anderson said that he finally
agreed to print the mimeo—
graphed paper after Editor Roy
Walker and other Black Stu-
dents talked to him “Tor an hour
and twenty minutes and
wouldn't give in."

According to Walker, CBS had
bought printing supplies irom
Grinnell cilice Supply as part
at an agreement that the firm
would print The Brotherhood.

Anderson said that he had
agreed to print the paper. but
that he was unaware that four-
letter words would be used. He
said he told the Black students
they could return the supplies
they had bought and he would
relund their money, ii they
wished.

Walker was not satisfied with
Anderson's reason for not want-
ing to print The Brotherhood.
“We’ve used the word 'nigger'
in past issues, and he’s never
objected,” he said. "His reasons
weren't concrete."

Anderson said that his person-
al dislike of {ourvletter words
is the only reason he didn't
want to print the Black stu-
dents’ paper. "They tried to
bring color into it, but l’m not
discriminating at allr I told
them i was more on their side
than on any other," he told the

} Theft

Continued from Page I

Although he doesn't like to call stu-
dents thieves, Hand said he has a prob-
lem with students who sneak food out oi
the dinlng halls He explained that he
doesn't mind students who "pick up a
few cookies to eat on the way out,” but
he cannot tolerate those who “are greedy
ll'ICl start wrapping things up in napkin:
to sneak out.’I

Hand said that he realizes that many
Itudents justify stealing trom SAGA be.
cause they think the Food Service takes
advantage of them. “I know how I’m
despised by many students because at
the way I run Cowies, but l’ve got a job
to do land I do it as best I can,” he com-
mented, adding that he receives no
awards trorn SAGA tor his economy
measures. He claimed that SAGA works
within a budget and operates at a proiit
or only three to tive percent at Grin-
nellr He emphasized that if students
were charged only tor the individual
meals they eat rather than the seed
board lee tor the whole year, they
would be spending much more on land.
Lambie contends that SAGA and the
Bookstore do not make excessive proiits,
and he said that oil-campus students are
required to pay the board tee in order
to avoid the necessity of checking student
meal tickets at every meal to see which
ltudents have paid their lee.

Some students also take [God from the
Forum fountain without stopping to pay
the cashier, and Hand is aware oi this.
lie said that he sees no way to prevent
theit from SAGA, because even when he
stops students who are taking lood or

utensils they merely make excuses such
as “l was just borrowing it," or “I lor-
got to pay."

Reception Center bosses 5600 Carpet

Director oi Residences Ralph Pomer-
enk estimates that the value of property
stolen trom'lounges and the Reception
Center and never recovered reaches as
high as $500 in a given year." Although
many items are discovered in student
rooms by maids and returned, Pomerenk
believes there is still ”a very serious
problem"

Among the items stolen and as yet unv
recovered this year are a 5600 carpet
and a wall painting from the Reception
Center, plus several chairs. small ta-
bles and lamps from various lounges
and rec-rooms on campus. Pomerenk at-
tributes the losses “more to students
than to outsiders, although outsiders are
also involved." He said there is "no m8-
gical answer” to prevent theft at College
property, but he suggests that “vigilance
on the part of Students and faculty might
help"

Lamble added beds, mattresses, and
even hassocks from the Fomm‘s South
Lounge to the list or turniture being sml<
en periodically from the College. “I’m
not absolutely certain where it disap
pears to, but there’s probably some stu-
dent involvement," he said. “Perhaps
some of it goes to students living oft-
campus who rented unfurnished apart-
ments."

Thett irom vending machines on cam-
pus is also “of some concern" to Pom-
erenk. He said that last year $100 in mer-
chandise was stolen from the cigarette
machine in Cowles lounge, and this year
$60 Worth of merchandise was stolen
lrorn the machine in Loose laundry

roono 'me [and vending machines on
campus are also irequently damaged by
people who tame the doors open without
paying, according to Pomerenk.

College property is also stolen from
{acuity offices and the Science Building,
Lambie saidr Typewriters, tape record-
ers and other otiioe equipment disap-
peared last year from various offices as
well as a set of binoculars and some
other scienliiio apparatus irom the
Science Building

Students steal from Student:

in addition to college property, hun-
dreds oi dollars worth or personal be-
longings are stolen from Grinncll slu»
dents annually. Recently several coats
were stolen irorn Cowles lounge during
a meal, and several purses left outside
dining halls have also been stolen, Ac-
cording to Lambie, stereos, cameras,
wallets and gel! clubs have been re-
ported stolen from student rooms in the
residence halls. He thinks that outsiders
are otten involved, but there is no way
to be certain Bicycles, phonograph re-
cords, clothes, books and wallets are
items which are irequently stolen, ac-
cording to Doug Ensmingcr, Assistant
Dean of Students.

Dean oi Women Alice low In a tele-
phone interview said that only a dozen
students reported theft of their personal
property last semester, but added that
she feels “many students don’t bother
to report losses through channels." She
said that she urges all students who are
missing items to report to their resident
advisors or to the Deans’ Office and fill
out a iorm. According to Dean Low local
police occasionally recover stolen stu-
dent property which can be identified
irom student descriptions and returned to

the owner. when reported, stolen items
sometimes “get too hot and are left in
campus buildings” where they can be
recovered, she said

Dean Low also recommended that sine
dents lock their rooms and “be alert to
strangers in the residence halls and chal-
lenge them." She said that purses and
other valuables should not be left out~
side dining halls where they can be
easily stolenr .

Speaking about the problem or student
theft in general, Dean Low sald thlt
"several students" were caught shop—
liitlug in downtown Gr‘lnnell last year. in
regard to theft of College property, she
believes that, “although some student:
lhlnk lt’s justifiable to steal from the ill:-
stitution, it’s just as dishonest as other
theft."

Al cloud, student manager or thl
campus radio station, when asked about
theft at KDlC's studio replied, “We do
have a terrible problem." He explained
that the station's problem dates back
to last spring when a mo tape recorder,
a 5160 power amplitier, a set of stereo
headphones, and other smaller pieces
or equipment were stolen from the sta-
tion's studio in Darby Gymnasium, He
said that since the permanent installa<
tion of heavy equipment has been com-
pleted, none has been stolen, but added
that “ n indeterminate number of rec-
ords” still is being stolen.

Speaking pessimistically about then
from KDIC, Cloud made a statement that
is perhaps applicable to the overall
problem of student theft at Gdnnell. He
said: “You have to depend on student
honesty, and hi have to admit that stu-
dent honesty is, well, sort oi question-
able.”

Returns from One-Month Visit

Frank Terms Cuban Revolution Peaceful, Economic

By JOHN muss

In a recent Life magazine article, Carl
Oglesby, former president of SDS, gives
a sympathetic but questioning appraisal
of Cuba's social revolution 10 years af-
ter Castro's rise to the country’s leader«
ship. Everywhere, reports Oglesby, is “a
tumultuous scramble to produce a pat-
tern." The most significant insight
Oglesby otters into the nature of this
"scramble" is that lts emphasis is first
and predominantly economic; its politi-
cal nature is relevant only insofar as the
politics of the country can be seen to
be serving the needs of economic revolu-
tion in Cuba.

Larry Frank, Grinnell junior, has just
returned from a month’s visit to Cuba
with many of the same insights as those
expressed by Oglesby into the present
nature and status of the Revolution in
Cuba. “The people are not political,"
Larry declared in a recent interview.
“They generally are not concerned with
the workings oi the Communist Party
or With the machinery ol revolution.
Their interests are economic and soci :
food, Clothing, education, and health.”

Larry flew to Cuba —— via Mexico City
— on Dec. 27, as a member of a small
group oi reporters and photographers
invited by the Cuban government to
visit the country under the sponsorship
of the Liberation News Service. Larry
won the invitation on the merits of pho<
tography submitted by him to LNS.

The first two weeks of the visit were
spent primarily in government-organized
group “tours" in various “Showplace”
industries and projects, such as farms.
iish processing plants, and dairies. In
Larry's opinion, the predominant reeling
ot the group was that these tours

amounted to “pure propaganda," and
that most oi the group became disil<
lusioned with hopes oi gaining a real
insight into Cuban society by the time
the group‘s oiiicial period oi visit end-
ed.

After the LNS group had officially
broken up, Larry began his own search

ciety of Cuba. Making his own tours of
areas of Havana and the outlying com<

as “terrible," primarily because of a Cru<
cial lack of housing which now exists in
urban Cuba. As is true oi many living
in Havana, Larry explained, the man
was not able to live in a home or his
own with his family. Both he and his
wiie were iorced, due to shortage oi
housing, to live with their respective
parents, and were only able to find real
privacy together by checking into a ho-
tel. Such practice, according to Larry,
has become a commonly-accepted social
institution in Cuba, for married and
unmarried couples alike.

Despite complaints about the Cuba of
today. however, Larry did not ﬁnd the
maitre d' to be among the 200,000 Cuban
citizens currently awaiting the oppor-
tunity to emigrate “He told me he was
staying," Larry related, “because he
feels that Cuba will become a better
place for his children."

Larry did encounter in his conver-
saiions a toll spectrum or opinion on the
state oi Cuba today. Exemplary oi one
extreme of opinion was a Black Cuban
Larry met, who “slapped his stomach
to Show me how well-fed he was, and
proudly showed me the bottoms oi his
kids' shoes, which had no holes."

At the other end of the spectnlm were
people Larry spoke to in a slum area
or Havana, which displayed “tilth worse
than Selma," in Larry's opinion. Here,
where Larry found 300 people using the
Same common bathroom facility, where
people had to carry their own water to
the common toilet, people were extreme-
ly bitter about the Revolution, and
spoke angrily of government promises
which had not yet begun to filter down
to their stratum in Cuban society.

Strides in Education

Larry reported discovering, as did
Oglesby, that “fantastic strides“ have
been taken in the area of education
throughout Cuba. “All children — both
in the city and in the country — are
now in school full time," Larry said.

Children Start to school in Cuba on a
level comparable to American kinder-
garten. Throughout primary school,
children are encouraged to begin de-
veloping iields or “interests" which will
eventually be channelled into prepara'
tion ior future occupations. By the time
children enter secondary schools, they
have deﬁned several “interests" more
completely, and join “circles oi inter-
ests” With other students These “cir-
cles" then meet regularly with a teacher
or resource adviser for extracurricular
discussions of their interest field.

“Circle" meetings continue through
the preUniversity level, by which time
each student is expected to have re-
fined his particular interest to the level
of sophisticated study which is charac-
teristic oi a “maior in an American
college. Participation in “circles" is ot-
ficially voluntary but it is at the same
time both a somewhat - pressured
“norm," and also a prerequisite for ad.
mission to a University.

Larry commented that his initial im-
pression of the Cuban University was
that it is “like universities everywhere"
in terms oi atmosphere and general
characteristics or the student body. One
aspect oi the University which Larry
later discovered is that each University
is also a modified military base of sorts.
Every studcnt has a gun and is assigned
to a squad of students organized by one
leader ior the purpose ui mobilization in
the event pi emergency situations re-
quiring the deiense oi the country, city,
or University area.

Each Class of 3040 students is also
organized under a single leader, who
serves as class spokesman, discussion
leader, and general liaison between the
class and the professor. in addition, each
class is divided into two equal groups,
which compete academically during the

school year ior the “honor" or being
granted a greater amount of “voluntary
labor” at the time or harvesting crops.

Larry noted that the majority of Uni-
versity professors are very young, and
that the government has apparently not
yet been able to completely overcome
a serious lack of educators. An instruc-
tor ior a one-year course in humanities,
for example, is likely to have as prepara
ation only a six-month training period
in his field.

Although no philosophy “department"
as such exisits in Cuban Universities,
there are required philosophy courses
in MarxistrLeninist thought ior every de-
partmental field. “An interesting side-
light," added Larry, “is the fact that
Cuban Universities have by now Cum-
pletely discarded initially-used Russian
texts on Marxist-Leninist philosophy as
inferior in content and intellectual ap-
peal, and are now using their own text!
on the subject in the University."

Style of Lire Spare, Few Luxuries

Larry found the average Cuban cid-
zen’s standard of living to be “adequate
— but nothing really beyond.” People
have “enough" to eat, but almost every-
thing on the Cuban consumer market is
presently rationed in the interests or
maximum exportation and resultant
economic growth. ”Even bars are open
only on weekends,“ Larry reported,
“and everyone carries a ration card
which entitles him to a maximum of
two beers."

Social life in Cuba ls limited primarily
to two major institutions. according to
Larry: hotels (as utilized by the maitrc
d' and his wife) and movies. Cuban
movies are made under the auspices or
the government agency lCAlc. Larry re<
marked that the movies he saw seemed
to be relatively iree irom strict governa
ment censorship, although he ielt that
they were deiinitely aimed thematically
at involving the Cuban people more ex-
pansively in the programs of the Revo<
lution.

Larry viewed several documentary
films, in addition to films of more artis-
tic nat re. One of these, entitled
“Lucia,‘ is currently receiving world4
wide Critical attention as the best ﬁlm
ever made in Cuba. The film consists of
three vignettes whose theme is the his.
torical evolution of the role of the Cuban
woman -— from the oppression of a sex-
ohsessed nineteenth-century society un<
der Spanish rule; through a period oi
the ﬁrst strikes of the 1930's; to the
present “liberation" oi women through
employment and equal participation in
the Revolution.

Influences on Church and Press

There apeais to be, in Larry’s opinion.
stringent control by the government
over the press. There are three major
newspapers in Cuba: Granma. the oiii-
cial organ of the Communist Party; El
Mundo, a paper put out entirely by Unis
Versity students; and Juventud Rehelde.
the publication of the Communist Youth
Organization. All three papers are pub-
lished daily, and vary between 4-8 pages
in length.

As an example oi evident censorship
of the press, Larry cited a January in-
cident involving a truckload oi Cubans
who attempted to break into the us.
naval base at Guantanamo. The inci-
dent, which Larry later discovered was
iully reported in the papers in the United
States, received no mention in Cuban
newspapers, prcsumably ior its polen-
tinlly adverse propaganda.

The one aspect of Cuban life which
Larry iound to be almost entirely iree
of government intervention was that of
religion. The majority or Cubans remain
“very religious" Catholics, Larry re<
ported;.several oi havana's churches

By GARY HANSJERGEN

The corporate “we" of Gl‘inneli stu-
dents sits on its hands, rocks back and
forth, feels the winds on its face, but
sees nothing through glazed eyes. Every
so often an indiVldual starts away from
the "we" because he has been provoked
and prodded by unendurable extraneous
factors and frees his hands and eyes. I
am free. i take it upon myself to wield
the prod awhile.

I am a member of the Political Science
Student Educational Policy Committee,
the only body of its kind at a department
level at this school. I Will structure my
remarks around the work this organiza—
tion has undertaken DVE!‘ the last month
in light or student power at Grinnell.

The emergence of the Political Science
Strident Educational Policy Committee
has been a part of the current discussion
about direct student participation in the
academic and administrative life of this
college. Make no mistake, however, its
establishment was in no way a response
to articulated or perceived student de-
mands. The activities of vocal students
over the last few years have been glor-
ious but restricted. It was a surprise to
me to tum from fights where
years of concession had scraped down to
basic, uncompromisahle p o s i t i o n s to
areas where students were welcomed as
allies and fellow contributors.

Earlier this semester the benevolent
spirits in the Political Science Depart-
ment requested the election of a commit~
tee of ﬁve students which would meet
regularly with the five faculty in a
strong consultation relationship to dis-
cuss and act for the department vis—a-
vis the rest of the school. in one of the
rare moments in the life of a Grinnell
student, several majors led by Don Ma-
lum decided that the opportunity had ar-
rived to strike against continual pater-
nalis/rni They attempted to form a Stu-
dent committee by student consensus
which would go beyond the faculty propo~
cal in having a strong voice in the run<
ning of their department. The result was
a meeting of about 85% of the majors,
called and conducted by students, in
which complaints and suggestions were
aired and the student committee estab-
lished, The committee consists of Grant
Crandall, Howard Ward, Kathy Keelan,

still boast congregations of up to two
and three thousand. Larry also visited
five Jewish synagogues in Havana, and
commented that while there are no pram
ticing rabbis in Havana (due to lack of
sufficient income opportunity). Jewish
congregations also remain active.

Official relations between church and
state in Cuba remain very good, said
Larry. In the opinion of most of the
people he questioned, Castro is “too
smart” to jeopardize popular support
for his Revolution by trying to instigate
suppression of religious activity

The government has not totally ab-
sented itself from the area of religion.
however. Sermons frequently attempt
to encourage congregations to support
the Revolution, especially by participab
ing in harvesting crops. The govem-
ment’s current controls over all meat
facilities make Cuban Jews dependent
upon government distribution at all
kosher meat products, The government
also has made itself responsible for sup—
plying teachers ior the education of
Jewish children in Hebrew culture. Per-
haps the greaiest indication that govern-
ment permissiveness in the area at re<
ligiiin is more pragmatic than ideologi»
cally in tune with the interests of the
Revolution is the fact that it is almost
impossible to rise within the rank of the

are united in their desire to work in

students

Their work through February has been
a total review of department Curriculum.
There has been a remarkable attempt on
the part of the Political Science faculty
to encourage and accept student criti-
cism and proposals. Decisions have been
made by consensus and their power to
persuade has proved to be equal to that
of the faculty. The committee has had
success in most areas of removing
dated courses, renovating others, and
instituting brand new offerings. In some
cases its ideas have been accepted in
entirety. There is no doubt that the com-
mittee has changed the department for
the better, not only in curriculum areas,
but by its evaluation of teaching meth.
ads and materials and With respect to
counselling relationships between iaculty
and students. The work they do this
year will insure that no major decisions
concerning political science teaching per-
sonnel will be made in the coming years
without the students involved in that de-
partment having shaped and agreed to it.

Benevolent spirits exist in all depart-
ments at Grinnell. It is time to accept al-
lies and assume the responsibility which
power demands require. No person dea
serves to have more of a say in the flinc-
lioning of n deparlment than the stu-
dents who are subjected to its inadequa-
cies over a four year period. The time
has come to act on all fronts in move

Communist Party if one is "actively res
Iigious.”

One of Larry's most interesting obser-
vations about Cuban life under the Revo-
lution involved the subject of crime
The overall crime rate in Cuba is un—
believably low, a fact Larry attributed
to one form at “Revolutionary conscious
ness." Most Cubans seem to consider
crime to be “counter-revulutionary" by
nature, and therefore seek naturally to
suppress it.

Thrust in Agriculture

In general terms, changes in Cuban
life as a result of the Revolution are
most evident in the country, Larry re-
ported. The combined forces of expand-
ed education, improved health meas-
ures, and increased emphasis on the im-
portance of agriculture have resulted in
great improvements in the living con-
ditions of Cuba’s rural populace. City
life, which was relatively affluent before
Castro’s Revolution, has understand-
ably suffered due to the shift in interest
and expenditure of resources, and it is
in the cities that real dissatisfaction Is
now to be found.

Agriculture, the focus of the Revolu-
tion’s interest and endeavor, is as yet
still unmechanized, and depends almost
entirely upon hand labor. It is one of
the hopes of the government that if this
year‘s goal of producing 10 million tons
of Sugar is realized, the economy will
then be able to support expansion into
other industries eventually abandoned
after Castro’s first abortive attempw to
channel labor and resources into other
areas of production.

Larry mentioned that the government
officially attempts to give the impres-
sion that all land In Cuba is owned by
the government. an eventual goal of the
Revolution. In truth, approximately 60%
of the land in Cuba is still privately
owned, Larry reported that the govem—
ment has no plans at present for force-
able takeover of private lands, but that
a program aimed at inducing landlords
to donate their land [0 the government
is now in progress. The government as-
signs voluntary laborers to assist in
the harvest of crops, hoping to create
sufficient gratitude on the part of the
landowners that they will eventually
give their lands up to the state.

Castro's Rapport Genuine

Among the highlights of Larry’s stay
in Cuba was his attendance at a rally
of 300,000 people gathered in hear Castro
speak on the occasion of the 10th an-
niversary 0f the Jan. 2, 1959. Revolu-
tion. Larry stated that he was at ﬁrst
disturbed at what appeared to be a
"lack of enthusiasmH on the part of the
“quiet, rather subdued” crowd which was
listening to Castro. It became gradually
apparent however, that the relationship
between Castro and the Cuban citizenry
has by now evolved from emotional
rapport to one which is “pitched more
intellectually." Larry found Castro’s
speech to be “amazingly educational” in
tone and nature.

In Larry's opinion, Castro apeared
“incredibly comfortable” during the
speech. The crowd was attentive and
interested, Larry stated. and seemed to
reﬂect an honest, pervasive tnlst in
Castro and his intentions to meet the
needs of the people through expansion
and explanation of the Revolution. None-
theless, Larry added, there is still a
minimum or one assassination attempt
made per month on Castro's life.

Film Sabotaged

while Larry prolessed coming away
from Cuba wah a general confidence
that present government controls and
programs can be justified as necessary
to the ends of the socioeconomic Revo-
lution, he also left Cuba with an en-
tirely personal grievance with Castro’s
government and at least one oi its seli—
protective policles. It was not until he
turned to Grinnell and began develop
ing the pictures he had taken during his
stay that he discovered that 201 rolls of
his film had been either x-rayed or ex-
posed tu radioactive material, thus
“fogging" the film and making any kind
oi legible print almost impossible. Larry
expressed doubt that any rolls except
for the 10 or 12 he was carrying on his
person at the time of his departure will
be salvageable.

Larry left Cuba Feb. 4, traveling by
Cuban freighter to St. John’s. Newfound-
land, and from there back in the United
States, Summing up the general nature
of his newly-updated impression of
Cuba, Larry emphasized the peaceiul
nature of the present moment of Cuba’s
socioeconomic revolution. "1 went 9»-
peciing to find signs of a violent socb
ety," Larry stated. “What I found was
a government and a people engaged in
an orderly effort to achieve economic
stability anil social Change.”

less, the college has yet to determine a
speciiic off-campus apartment policy.
In the future such a policy might include
the decision that, to enable greater
variety in living options, the college
would increase the number of people cit-
campus by a certain percentage each
year. The capacity of the town and the
proposed enrollment for each year will
continue to be controlling iactors.

As changes in the oil-campus offering:

planning new dormitory changes for

relieving overcrowding, for upgrading BX-
Isting dormitories, and for making
another coed dormitory hold top con-
sideration at this time. Change in dormi-
tory structure is a slow process, but one
which can make a significant. difference
in the climate at Grinniell.

Iowl Legnlation

Senator Richard Stephens (Re
Washington) last month intrl)<
duced a bill (Senate File 143) in
the Iowa Senate that calls for
the summary dismissal of any
rtudent or iaculty member who
participates in a campus strike
or disturbance. Several legisla<
tors and the Iowa Board of Re-
gents are opposing the bill be-
cause s u m m a r y dismissal
denies due process oi law and
is therefore unconstitutional.
One or the Regmts attended
many legislators by calling the
bill “fascist.”

Last Monday Governor Robert
Ray signed into eitect a law
that arms campus policemen
on the campuses or the state
universities by conierring upon
them the authority or “peace
ollicer." The bill was passed by
the lawn legislature last month
after lobbyists tor the Board 0!
Regents strongly urged its pas-
sager

Gov. Ray said on Tuesday
that he Signed the hill only after
Regents assured him that cam-
pus policc would not be armed
during student demonstrations.
Ray has been reticent about
criticizing legislators tor deal-
ing with the subject of Student
protest. but he has stated that
lawmakers Should not interfere
with Ihe academic freedom of
universities.

Bowen Speaks Out

Several of lowa's university
presidents are delending their
schools liom attacks by legisla-
torss President Howard Bowen
at the University of lowa. who
recently announced his resigna-
tion, has voiced Special concern.

“It is inevitable and desirable
that the campuses should be-
come the center of debate. dis-
cussion and action on these mat-
ters. It is utterly irrational to
rear universities or penalize
them because ideas are dis-
cussed there . or because a
true Concern exists there for
peace and brotherhood. Colleges
and universities must be tree
{mm political control and free
in speech and thought," Bowen
said.

The student senate at the Uni-
versity ol Northern lowa launch
ed a campaign several weeks
ago encouraging students to
communicate their views on
various hills to legislators

through the proper channels.
More than one third at the stu-
dent body signed petitions which
were presented to lawmakers.
hundreds sent letters to their
representatives, and many trav-
eled It) the Statehouse to speak
personally to lawmakers.

Several legislators criticized
the U.NJ. students tor clogging
the mails with form letters.
Others accused university Presi-
dent J. W, Maucker oi insti-
gating the campaign by stu-
dents in order to get more runds
for the university, Both Mauker
and student leaders have denied
such accusations.

Court Upholds Protest

Last week's Supreme Court
decision on the Des Moines arm-
band case may have wide-rang-
ing impact on the growing
struggle h e t w e e n lawmakers
and those who defend academic
treedom, The Court, by a 772'
decision, held that a student's

fused to remove black arm»

other Hills Introduced

In Wisconsin 11 bills hav-
been introduced to the state he
scmbly that would give much or
the universities' power to tho
state, permitting the state to
deal directly with student pro»
testors. Meanwhile, the Madi-
son campus cooled on as black
students persuaded white radi-
cals to return to class and not
risk lurther confrontations with
the police and National Guards~
men.

More than a dozen bills have
been introduced in the lllinois
legislature as a result of cam.
pus disturbances. Sen. Karl
Berning has asked for $25,000
to create a university disorders
investigative committee. and
has also introduced 8 bill pro—
viding tor expulsion of students
lrorn state-supported institutions
{or vandalism, rioting, and other
unlawlul acts against the in-
stitutlons.

Sen. John Lanigan sponsored
three bills designed to “zero in
on radical or other Subversive
elements now using college cam.
puses to toment revolution."
One or Lanigan's bills would ina
crease the maximum penalty
for anyone who advocates vio
lent overthrow oi the govern—
ment on university property
from 10 to 20 years.

Another bill calls for imme<
diate revocation of scholarshin
lunds for anyone who particl-
pates in an unlawful disturb-
ance against a university's ad-
ministmtion. A third Lanigan
bill would fix a $5,000 line or 5
years in pnscn or both tor any-
one who damages property at a
state institution.

The University or Chicago’s
Council oi the University Sen<
ate. which comprises 50 faculty
members. called for expulsion
of unruly students and the use
of police to curb disturbances
on campus. During the is days
Students occupied the Adminis»
tration Building last month, the
administration had maintained
a hands-oft policy.

Nixon — ‘Get Tough’

President Nixon deprecated
student rioters and demonstr’l-
tors and supported a get to
policy last week in his first
Statement on campus disturb-
ances. He commended Father
Hesburgh ol Notre Dame Uni-
versity tor announcing that he
would not hesitate to call in
police to deal with any students
who demonstrate violently or
nonviolently.

State govemors, meeting in
Washington last week, agreed
with Nixon's get tough policy,
saying that “Lawless acts by
a small segment at the student
population must not be allowed
to interlere with the vast num-
ber ot students who are seeking
to exercise their educational
opportunin‘ s."

Reacting similarly, President
5, I. Hayakawu or San Francis-
co state College, is now prour
ising a purge of dissident tac-

ulty and students. Criminal
charges are being brought
against student protest leaders,

GRINNELL, Ia. -— Don
Kraitsik Wlll lead a seven-man
Grinnell College contingent to
the Midwest Conierence wres-
tling meet in Northlield, Minn.
Carleton will host the affair,
which is scheduled [Dr Friday
night and Saturday (March 7-3).

Kraitsik is regarded as one
OI the top Contenders for the 177
pound championship alter post-
ing an 11-3 record in dual meet
competition, One 01 the losses
came at 191 pounds.

The author of a 30-12 career
record, Krailsik copped the 157
pound championship in 1967, but
slipped to third in that class
last winter after missing most
at the season with an injury.

Other Pioneers that Coach
Conney Kimho expects to place
are Mason Klippel 145; and
Steve l-lntchings, 167.

Klippel is 752 for the season.
lititcliings has only a 1.7.2
mark, but has wrestled at 191
or heavyweight most oi the
time.

Grilinell's other entries are

Mike Kawaliara, 123; John
Pedel‘sen, 137; Bob LeBell, 152;
and Ted Click, 160.

A big blow to Pioneer hopes
tor a iirst division spot was
the late season loss of 1677poulltl~
er Bill Wedding by the injury
route. He was the lnup’s num-
ber two man at 160 a year ago,
and this time was expected to
be a top contender at 167.

Cornell is an oddsron iavoriie
to carry home its 25th cham~
pionship in 23 years. Likely to
produce the stiiiest challenges
to the Rams are Carleton and
St. Olai.

SAGA Flicks

By MOLLY MCGUIRE

As another juicy morsel in his irothing
Cauldron of goodies, SAGA Chuck is
dishing out a new delicacy to the stu-
dents — a SAGA-inspired, SAGA-spom
sored ﬁlm festival. The extravaganza
will be held In the Sacrosanct conﬁnes of
the Quad dining hall this Friday, March
7, (tonight,) at 7:30 pm (meal cards
are not necessary and the doors will re.
main open thmughout the evening.)

Contrary to popular opinion, the even-
ing’s entertainment (billed as SAGA
Soul Night on the social calendar) will
not include SAGA Martha and Jo doing
the Bop, nor a documentary on the his-
tory of SAGA since the Middle Ages (it
was called the Black Plague then.) in-
stead, the revelers will be entertained by
movies by such oldies-but-goodies as
W. C. Fields, The Three Stooges, and
the Little Rascals, with a few 10-minute
extracts oi old horror rlicks (the juiciest
parts) thrown in for added spice. See
Frankenstein in halid-to-hand mortal
combat with the Hunchback“ Tremble
as the Deadly Mantis invades the air!”
Watch as the Mummy ages mo years in
two seconds — then back again in iourl ll

Chuck vigorously denies the rumor that
he will be showing special skin ﬂicks,
but who can tell what he may do it
enough people Show upl

Not only will SAGA provide the enter-
taiiiment tree-ofscharge, but also the
goodies to lnuhch olll Peanuts, popcorn,
and Pepsi will be available to everyone
(with ample seconds it you save your
plate.) Rumor has it that Chuck has or.
dered 90 lbs. of peanuts for the festivi-
ties. so let this be a warning # it they
all don’t get eaten tonight, we’ll probably
be in [or a new taste sensation in our
mystery meat and jello tor the rest of
thet Semester!

Chuck plans to have more or these ies-
Iivals in the future, and said that if
anyone is interested in showing movies
outside in the spring, he would be happy
to provide refreshments (a SAGA Sleep-
in. maybe?)

nny Cox Returns to Grinnell

By GARY GIDDINS

This Saturday evening at 10:30 there
Will be a twinsbill concert in Younkers
Lounge. The periormers will lie Donny
Cox and the duo of Brewer and Shlpley.

Cox perlormed to an enthusiastic
audience at Grinnell last September. An
excellent singer and guitarist, he sings
a remarkably large repertoire ot iolli
music, blues and pop material. He also
plays guitar arrangements or rages,
Christmas Carols and the choral 5804
tion from Beethoven's Ninth, Danny.
who currently makes his home in San
Francisco, has been an itinerant folk-
singer for several years, traveling
throughout the countly. In the last year
he has begun to get wider exposure
singing on several Trv. variety shows
and performing at many colleges. The
theme or his music is H you guessed it
friends — love, with all its schmaltzy
ramifications proudly advertised. Like
Lord Buckly, he asks his audience,
"Would it embarrass you it I were to
tell you that i Love You?" It usually
does embarrass the audience, but re<
markably enough he means it, and, more
importantly, he communicates it.

Mike Brewer and Tom Shlpley have

also traveled around the country, pen-
iorming as a duo, for many years.
Though they come irom Ohio and Okla-
homa respectively, they met when both
moved to California. Each had worked
with various groups before they started
working together. Since then they have
recorded a tew singles including Keeper
of the Keys and Green Bamboo and
their llrst album. Brewer and Shlpley
Down in LA. Although they record with
rock accompaniment, their live pens
iormances feature their adept acoustical
guitar work and a tight harmony in
their singing. They compose all their
material, which consists at grass roots
folk inspired melodies and personal but
communicative lyrics. Broadside Magni-
zine in a record review, wrote of them,
“They have a well produced, advanced
folk-rock sound with is wellsstressed ems
phasis on rhythmic patterns. Over this
they add a good tlght harmony iollow.
ing good melodic lines," And High Fidel~
lty wrote of their albuml “The results of
this talented duo and so many right de<
cisions is one of the most satisfying and
professional debut albums ever heard in
rock."
So come and hear them.

Finally, Friday noon a ransom note
was presented to SAGA Chuck that pr0<

straight, they are not connected wilt

the story behind the spoon-napping.

Apparently, the idea for this super-

one night when the “Gentleman’s Gour.

too long for their food, and then didn't
get enough. For revenge, they decided
to subtly pilter at least 143 spoons from
the dining room (class of ’71 and '72.)

gang stealthily lett each meal with any-

cache awaiting their eventual release.
