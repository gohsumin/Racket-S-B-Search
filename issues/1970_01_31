Anderson Leads
Christian Symposium

Between Sunday and Tuesday
of this week, Dr, Francis Ann
dcrsen was the featured speaker
in a symposium, the Future oi
Christianity in the Poserhristian
Era, Copies of Dr. Andersen’s
speeches will be available soon
from the Grinnell College Chris-
tian Fellowship.

Dr. Andersen, a native Aus.
tralian, is Professor of Old Testa-
merit Literature at the Church
Divinity School of the Pacific in
Berkeley and Visiting Professor
of Ugaritic at the University of
California. He holds seven
degrees, including an MA in
Physical Chemistry, an MA. in
Russian language and literature
and a PhD. in Oriental
languages from John Hopkins
University. His specialty for the
last 15 years has been early
Canaanite and ancient Hebrew.

In an interview the 5&8 asked
Dr. Andersen whether he thinks
his broad education has given
him any important insights in his
field. “of course it's difficult
enough to excel in one subject
these days. let alone many. But
I prefer to have had the broad
experience than not. Most theolr
ogians can‘t base an opinion of
scientific work on knowledge. A
scientist who loves his subject —
and appreciates the structure of
the world isn‘t necessarily
godless as some theologians
say." Dr. Andersen said that as
far as he knows, no institute has
yet been formed to join the sciena
tist and the theologian for long.
range work. Such an institute
might be helpful to both. ”When
a scientist raises questions about
the origin of the universe, he is
outside the range oi purely scien-
tific speculation.” How would Dr.
Andersen distinguish between
theology and science? “That is
a hard distinction to draw, but
part of it is this: Although the
methodology in science is agreed
upon. theology is done in many
different Ways by different theol-
ogians. Some theologians begin
with man and make their theol-
ogy a sort of selfvunderstanding.
Others study it as a classical
discipline, a system of thought
which can be learned and

personal experience and can't be
learned from a book. Still others
begin theology with the
assumption that God has
revealed himself, For these, the
task becomes to discover what

places himseli in the last group.

may avoid the philosophical task

that although many are well
trained, he Wishes that more
were practiced in thinking
critically and following an argu—
ment. “Many seem to believe
that anyone has the right to say
anything he wishes without the
responsibility of supporting his
statements.” He suggested that
undergraduate seminars might
be a good way to solve the
problem.

”The students we have now are
far more candid and interesting
than those we had lo years ago,
There seems to be a revolution
against the attitude that the prep
fessor is there only to inculcate
knowledge, and this is right. Part
of the professor’s task is to in
spire in the student a life-long
interest. But at the same time
the student should not believe the
professor has nothing to teach.”

Andersen observed that many
students can talk openly and
irankly about sex but are very
coy about studying religion.
Perhaps they don‘t discuss religr
ion enough. “Is there a limit to
how far a question can be pur-
sued in the classroom? It would
be tragic to think that anything
that borders on theology is off
limits. This raises an important
question: Can neutrality be
preserved in the university?”

What are Mr. Andersen‘s views
on the student power movement?
It always seemed important to
me for students to have a real
role in the community they com-
prise. When a group of students
requested that student observers
be allowed to attend faculty
meetings, 1 ielt it was not enough.
Students should he allowed to
participate in running the school
a they should help both in
making decisions and in doing the
work." Anderson pointed out that
the Seminary’s students are all
graduate students, many on their
way to careers in universities.
”They are not fools, but they are
inexperienced in running a uni-
verslty. The only way to get
experience is by helping to run
the school,” Andersen said that
any proposals which would give
the taculty no voice are ob-
jectionable. “There should be a
sense of common enterprise.”

(35 On Black America

The speakers who came to
Grilmell under the sponsorship of
the Concerned Black Students
lectured last Saturday on the
American black experience and
its implications.

William E. Cross, Jr., in
structor in Afro-American
studies at Princeton, presented
ahypothesis that a black person
“experiences a series of well de-
fined stages in becoming trans
formed from a ‘Negro,’ with all
the bad connotations of that term,
to a “Black" or ”Afro-Amer
ican," with all its good connoo
tations.”

Finley Campbell, assistant
professor of English and
chairman of the AfroVAmerican
Studies Committee at Wabash
College, portrayed the Black
Panther Party, guided by a com-
plex ideology and a humani-
tarian outlook, as the key force
inblackliberation.

In his lecture, “Black Ex—
perience Seen as Process,” Cross
divided the process of the trans
formation of the American black
man from “Negro" to “Afro—
American” into four stages: pre
encounter, encounter, im-
mersion-emersion, and inter
nallzation and commitment.

During the prerencounter
stage, according to Cross, the
lower or middle class black leads
a contented life, but with the
world view of the white racist
society. Although he knows that
society is wrong, he does not
believe the system is at fault, and
in his personal life he adopts the
white cultural value system, with
its emphasis on the advancement
of the individual. as his own.
_—

At the seminary, the students
participating are doing well.
The gravest weakness, however,
in the system is the “complete
lack of Continuity." There is such
a rapid turnover that by the time
a student learns the ropes he
quits. He indicated that although
the participating students may
learn a lot, the university hasﬂg
gained much in the long run
because of this. Nor‘do programs
worked out with these students
always satisfy the student body.
This year, for instance, a new
curriculum was instituted at the
various Seminaries in the Bay
area. “It was worked out in close
consultation with students 7 in
fact, one could almost say it was
student written." The new
curriculum was not accepted by
the students as a whole any better
than the old one had been. Dr.
Andersen blamed two factors:
First, many didn’t know that
students had helped in designing
the Curriculum. Second, this
year‘s class has a diilerent
outlook from the students who
helped write the curriculum.
“It's hard to respond to student
needs when those needs change
or are hard to discover.”

The world view and personal
outlook oi the black in the pre-en-
counter stage is often disturbed
by some event or experience that
causes him to question his outs
look and values, Cross explained.
After this experience, or “ens
counter," he will consider new,
more radical, interpretations of
the black experience. In this
stage, he will also begin to feel
guilt for the way he has been
living.

This guilt erupts and results
in a new search Tor black idenr
tity, in the third “immersion-
emei-sion" stage. During this
period, he will “immerse himself
completely into the world of
blackness“ and he will tear him-
self completely from his previous
white outlook. He will also
develop a ieeling of black super-
iority and will think of the white
man, as biologically inferior.
According to Cross, this very
race conscious black will seek
confrontations with whites,
especially police, during this
period. When his urge for con
frontation is satisfied, he will
enter me “emersion” period #
a state of relaxation during which
he will discard his formerly
racist outlook as he begins to feel
more and more in Control of his
life.

Finally, the experiences of the
previous three stages will either
frustrate or inspire the individ
ual, and this will determine
which direction he will follow in
the fourth, “internalization and
commitment" stage. Here,
Cross said, the individual may
feel disappointment and rejection
or may continue in the “immer-
sion" stage if he has been frusA
trated, li he is encouraged, he
may either “incorporate
psychologically the idea that he

can dig himself,“ and go no
further, or he may commit him-
self to action.

Campbell, who spoke on the
“Ideological Roots of the Black
Panther Party,” discussed the
many ideologies which the Black
Panther Party draws on, with an
emphasis on their humanistic
facets. He said that the ideolog-
ical motivation of the Panthers
— “What’s to these guys other
than that they can die“ — is
complex, and normally not well
understood.

Because the Black Panther
Party will be leading this fight
against the white man’s exploita-
tion of men and the environment,
Campbell said he expected many
others who are concerned with
these things to join with the
Party’s efforts in those fields. He
emphasized, however, that the
primary concern of Black Pan-
thers is the “black national com-
munity,” and no one can follow
the party only part of the way.

Campbell concluded by listing
three ingredients to the party’s
actions. First, the Panthers
combine tribalism and politics in
“Tribalitics,” a way to “col-
lectivize the political iacets oi
society without interfering with
the individual in that society."

Secondly, it combines “Euro-
Christian radicalism” with the
African Christian tradition into
the concept of developing cone
science and intuition collectively
7 according to Campbell,
“everybody does the same thing,
but in their own way."

Finally, the Black Panther
Party, looking at American
populism with a MarxistLeninist
interpretation, takes “newV
populism" as a third ingredient
to its ideology, according to
Campbell.

Two and a half years ago, a student at this col-
lege wrote a letter to the editor of the Scarlet &
Black complaining about inconsistencies in the col-
lege's treatment of one of our most “relevant"
campus issues: inequality of the sexes, To this day,
the questions asked by that student remain unan-
swered. It would seem that Grinnell has a long way
to go before some glaring discrepancies are elimi-
nated.

The student was James A. Arieti, and he was
complaining about lack of equality in the require-
ments for men’s and women‘s physical education of
Grinnell. Though token changes have been made in
both programs, the gap remains to be filled between
the two Can male students rest while they are yet
so cruelly wronged?

To make matters worse, the disparity is even
being augmented. This semester a seminar in the
Department of American Studies is being offered
for women only. The subject of the course is wom-
en. No one could maintain that Grinnell males
would evince a lack of interest in such a course,
Nonetheless, males are not allowed. Is there no
justice?

Perhaps campus males should form a group
along the lines of the current Women’s Liberation
Front, Its own programs seem to be very effective,
if nowhere else, in bolstering the resolve of its
members, Arsenic dialectic and frenetic manipula—
tion of previously enslaved Grinnell womanhood
have produced a small but dedicated core of female
students freed from the apron strings of male
chauvinisml

There are some difficulties in such a program,
howeverl Even those of us in the current generation
of students and faculty who are too old to have had
the benefit of a modern high school course in sex
education are still able to tell the difference bew
tween a man and a woman. As one liberated woman
confessed to us on campus a few days ago, “Some of
our ideas just seem to run counter to my nature."
She was forced to admit either that her nature
could not be changed or that she should try to
change it. If the women on campus decide on the
latter course of action, we suggest that the Women's
Liberation Front give up their bourgeois bake-sale
money-making program and begin charging admis-
sion to weightlifting exhibitions.

SCARLET AND BLACK

TO THE EDITORS:

You boys seem to have allowed
your newfound power to run
away with your sense, and
allowed irrational exuberance to
cloud your view of the iacls, 1
would like to correct a few
glaring errors in the discussion
of Grinnell's Student government
which appeared in last week’s
editorial.

You said that students desire
democracy f“. . .the principle oi
democracy ought to be operative.
. X’). a minor error in terr
minology with major results.

First, students have long
recognized that true democracy
is a system inherently corrupt.
Since its principle is the rule of
the majority over the minority,
it is merely a thinly disguised
form of that old evil, ”might
makes right": there ale more of
us, so our fraction is stronger and
will rule. Nothing could be less
just, especially in a country
capable oi electing the current
administration ‘and supporting
the current war. it is, after all,
the new working class which is
economically benefited by
munitions production, No,
whatever other errors our fellow
students make, they realize that
superiority in numbers, as in our
Superiority over North Vietnam,
is no Standard for determining
who should govern.

Second, thoughtful students
have come to realize the yicious
implications of so apparently
innocent a thing as “self
government ” As that sage of the
radical movement, Ambrose
Bierce, once so correctly ob-
served, there cannot be any such
thing as “self government.”
What can it mean to govern
yourself? Didn‘tilames Earl Ray
govern himself? Doesn't Richard
Millstone (SIC) Nixon govern
himself? What can governing
yourself mean except doing
whalrver you damn please?

Third, students will continue to

shrug off true democracy, and
illegitmate son, republicanism,
as long as they feel secure. When
rules were enforced by
sycophants of the establishment
( ask any senior what things were
like his freshman and sophomore
years), students had every
reason to fear the worst.
Student government becam.
active, and prevented uiose
traitors from having the ultimate
power they craved: the judicial
Council was formed. New
students know that they are safe
from enforcement, since they
themselves are doing the en-
forcing, is befits self govern-
ment. They know, further, that
if by some outrage a rule should
be enforced, the judicial council
will act in their behalf and refuse
to allow the injustice by claiming
interference in the case by the
deans. The fact that students now
feel secure is evidenced by the
relatively small number of
students, including myself, who
elected to move off campus this
year. .

No, as long as students are
secure at Grihnell, democracy is
doomed. I call your attention,
however, to our embattled
lacuily, who, fearing the ad.
ministration and desiring “5'
power. has organized into a true
democracy. Such exponents oi
powerrto-thespeople as Mr.
Nasser can tell you of the joys
of self government under lhose
circumstances.

May i suggest to the novice
editors that they could have
easily avoided their foolish error
by doing a little homework, For
instance, no onewould assert that
students want democracy and a
slrong student government ln a
college where the student
government is forced, as it was
last year, to call a referendum
lo determine whether it is even
going lo continue to cxisli

Dear Peter Bowman:
The Editors

You said you couldn’t “resist"
answering my letter in the sea
. .What you really couldn’t
resist was the male chauvinist’s
easyrway-out of a challenge: If
a female raises “serious”
questions just start talking about
the stereotype of female “consid-
el'able hysteria” and no one will
take her seriously.

But, are we to take you serious-
ly, Peter Bowman? Are we to
respect your noble “research" as
you quote the American Associa-
tion of University Professors (I
assume it is the A.A.U.P,, not
the ”A.A.P.”, as printed) 7 for
you quote them out oi full con-
text. And are your admitted “im-
prcssions“ of Pterodactyl’s
situation also part of your “re-
search"?

Why did you not include the
A.A.U,P. recommendation that
“Whenever possible the student
newspaper should be an inde-
pendent corporalion financially
and legally separate from the
college?" or, if you really did
your “research" you might write

ﬁ‘about a recent commission on
student publications made up oi,
among others, the presidents of
the American Society of News

Chi, fhc professional journalism
fraternity 7 a commission which
also recommended independence

ignoring the problem |n hope it
would go away.”

ON THE RIGHT

by William F. Buckley, Jr.

The
ident's
sage on
state 01 the
union was
pleasing to Mr.
James Reston,
a datum which
no doubt will
send the Dow

Jones average up ten points.
Much that Mr. Nixon said was,
of course, predictable: one
hardly expects a message on the
state of the union at which a
presidentexpresses the hope that
the years to crime will usher in
war, poverty, and hunger. The
meaty sections of the address
were a rhetorical ﬂirtation with
the notion that the government
can do something substantial
about the quality of our lives, and
the passages concerning our
obligations to nature.

It is widely accepted that Mr.
Nixon has promised to do
Something about the quality of
our lives, and it is important to
examine the question whether he
did so, and if so, what he meant
by it. Important because there
are those of us who believe that
the principal mistake made by
Lyndon Johnson is enunciating
his dream of a great society was
precisely in suggesting that the
government could utopianize the
human condition: that essential
human relations and spiritual
needs can be looked after by
government.

It is as obvious that this is not
the case as it is obvious that there
are people in this country with
no material worries of any kind
who nevertheless harbor foxes in
their bosoms Which drive them
to drink, to psychiatrist, or to
utter, desperate boredom. Mr.
Johnson‘s celebrated speech
concerning the shape of the great
society seemed to be saying that
under Johnson such maladies,
which are of the spirit, could be
made to go away, presumably
elevating them to Cabinet rank.
What happened, as they say, is
history.

is it to improve the “quality"
of human life, to do something
about pollution 7 the concretely
phrased objective of Mr. Nixon’s
speech? Perhaps, though it is to
stretch the meaning of “quality.”
I take it as axiomatic that no
one has the right to pollute the

Pres-
mes-
the

air I breathe, or the water I
drink, and that the latitudinarian
habits of a society whose frontier
was always bigger than any of
us, have finally caught up with
us, generating a common
revulsion. It is overdue for
government to assert its
responsibility in these matters.

Whoever said it was the
responsibility of free enterprise
to clean the water or purify the
air? Mayor Allotn recently took
a shot at Governor Reagan by
alluding to the million pounds or
whatever of sulphur in the air
over Los Angeles every day by
private users. To which governor
Reagan replied deploring the 70
million pounds of human offal
dumped every day into the San
Francisco by municipal sewers.

An unprofitable dispute, Adam
Smith himself, by the extension
of his notion that the government
is uniquely responsible for public
monuments, would surely have
accepted the notion that it is
governments responsibility to see
to it that the people do not despoil
the land, depriving future
generations of their birthright,

What we need to worry about
now is the nature of the great
bureaucracy which is inevitable
going to build up around the ten
billion dollar national anti-
pollution project. As my friend
Mr. William Rusher so adroitly
puts it, how much, after the
bureaucrats have taken their
share, Will actually be left over
for the chipmunks? Here is
where one hopes that there will
be an observable difference
between a Republican and a
Democratic administration of a
project which concededly belongs
to the government.

The trick, of course, is to lay
down the general laws, im-
partially, gradually, and let the
enforcement oi them be done by
the use of private mechanisms,
and mechanisms of the lowest
feasible unit of government. Mr.
Nixon has promised us an
elaboration. One looks forward to
it eagerly, hoping to find in it
accents on local responsibility,
and as little as possible of such
rhetoric as suggests that natural
hygiene will elevate the human
condition. Natural hygiene is
good because It is good. but it
does not follow from it that people

A WORD EDGEWISE

by John P. Roche

The conserr
vative case for
an essentially
isolationist for
eign policy
is on its lace
very strong. It
rests on the

- proposition that
remarkably few things mid

happen in this World which would
vitally affect our national inter
ests. We Should therefore
disengage behind, in Walter Lipp-
mann's phrase, ”blue water.” A
few solid commitments would
remain: the Monroe Doctrine is
usually taken for granted, and
we Would retain alliances with
insular powers such as Japan,
Britain, Australia, etc. Outside of
Latin America, we would View
with friendly disinterest events
in the developing world. What
concern of ours is it whether the
black tribe or the white prevails
in Rhodesia? Whether Com-
munists or non»Communists in
Vietnam? Arabs or Jews in
Israel?

If one extracts moralism as a
basic component of foreign
policy, the conservatives are
impregnable. 0ur continental
fortress is only vulnerable to the
Soviet Union, but for 25 years the
U.S.S.R. has been hoping that the
us. would agree to a spheres-of-
influence division of the world.
If We settled for the Western
Hemisphere, Britain and
Western Europe, Japan and
Australia, and abandoned
moralism (that is, the Cold War)
the sources of conﬂict with
Russia would presumably
vanish. In short, the two super
powers would go about their bus-
iness in their own baliwicks. (If
the New Left historians are
correct in asserting that the Cold
War arose from American pro-
vocations, this should bring
detente in short order; here, as
elsewhere. the New Left provides
conservative advance men .)

The high priest of this view of
national interest is the dis-
tinguished historian and
diplomat, George F. Kennan.
Back in 1951, Kennan presented
the essence of his position in a
little book that was a tour de
force, “American Diplomacy.”
With a surgeon’s scalpel, Kennan
opened up American 20th century

diplomacy and found it to be sufr
iering from a pervasive malig
nancy: Moralism 7 or, in his
precise formulation, “the legal-
isticrmoralistic approach to
international problems.”

With regard to Japan for ex—
ample, Kennan‘s tightly argued
thesis was that an intelligent
approach might have avoided
Pearl Harbor. But failing to
appreciate the forces that drove
the Japanese to expand, and
carried away by sentimental
attachment for China, we
“hacked away, year after year,
decade after decade" at the
Japanese encroachment on the
Asian mainland. “Had we been
over a long period of time more
circumspect in our attitudes
towards the Japanese, more conv
siderate of the requirements of
their position," he wrote, “there
was a possibility that the course
of events might have been
altered.” When we disregarded
“power realities in the Orient,”
we bought unnecessary trouble.

Kennan’s central argument is
proloundly pessimistic. Most of
our interventions, he suggests,
have created problems greater
than those they were designed to
meet. This was inevitable, per-
haps, because they are founded
on moralism, the crusading
fervor, rather than on rational
calculation of real interests. In
fact, we cannot shape the world
to our ideals, we cannot alter
history; thus he observed that
“the great misfortune of the
West, i suspect, was not Hitler
but the weakness of German
society which n. "é possible his
triumph.”

This leads one to assume a
spectator role in the world 7
except where vital interests are
at stake, say in Latin America.
(Lippmann, for example, sup-
ported our action in the‘Domini-
can Republic in 1965, while con-
demning Vietnam, because the
Western Hemisphere is vital and
Southeast Asia trivial.) It is an

Crinnell Professor Reviews

Student Admissions Film
By Charles G. Cleaver

I write this to atone. No or
three years ago, in reviewing a
film about Grinnell College. I
took the stance that it was in-
tended as comedy, in the tra-
dition of college movies that
lampoon college movies. My
assessment was that it was a
pretty funny job, except that the
flummery ought to have been
served up with a daintier trowel.

That was not candid. I did not
actually believe that comedy was
intended. Now, given the chance

to be straightforward and lauda— ,

tory at the same time, 1 am
obliged to take it. The new film
about Grinnell, by Campbell
Films (Jim Hormel, director, and
Milt Bellows, photographer), is
honestly stated and beautifully
executed.

Honesty: Mr. Terry says that
his first hope is that no student
who might be inﬂuenced by the
film to come to Grinnell will be
surprised by what he sees when
he arrives. I doubt that a more
representative slice of our life
could be jammed into twenty
minutes. In fact, the college
might, without violence to truth,
have broadcast a more flattering
image of itself, in certain ways,
than it does on this reel. Sturdily
refusing the travelogue shots
usual to the genre, Mr. Hormel
and Mr. Bellows barely allow us
a glimpse of the S.O.M. buildings
that we might brag about (one
exception is a stunning winter
scene taken in front of Burling.)
The orchestra has never sounded
worse than during the few sec-
onds they are allotted, our actors
never so stilted. No statistics are
recited about how many of our
students do well in decent purr
suits after they leave here. The
only scene that was staged,
shows it: i would bet plenty that
Mr. Graham isn’t ordinarily as
uncomfortable with two coreds
and a plant with variegated
leaves.

Any illusion that Grinnell is ut-
terly unique is dispelled in the
first few frames. when we hear
some guidance counselor
speaking about other liberal arts
colleges, as we watch scenes
from Oberline, Swarthmore, and
Pomona. Then follow pictures of
work and play here, in about their»
actual proportions 7 more of the
former than the latter. The
people who are shbwn doing our
things represent a fair random
sample of styles in facial and
bodily adornment. E. B. King and

the Francesco Trio appear. The
shot of Mr. Zirkle is true in some
quintessential way: a student
asks him, “HOW about the
height?" “There are other
problems first,” he replies,
masking a world of meaning.

We hear the voice of a male
student praising the college for
its curricular ﬂexibility and its
willingness to confer with
students about change; we hear
a female 'voice asserting that
Grinnell is a joyless place. A
black student says that the
college is good academically,
but, for him, wanting socially. A
good deal is made of small
classes and personal contact with
professors; if none of the big
classes that actually exist here
are shown, that appears to be
a function of style rather than
guile. Mr. Bellows did shoot in
a rather large class of Mr. Liber-
man’s, but he chose to focus on
the rapt expressions of individual
students rather than on the whole
scene.

The contradictions that we see
and hear are an important
element in the movie's truth: no
single and simple impression of
Grinnell can be adduced. We
believe the young woman when
she says that it’s a joyless place,
but we also believe our eyes when‘
we see pictures of joy. We believe
another student when he says
that going to college isn't all that
big a deal, after all; but, as his
voice is fading, we see the gaudy
and ﬂamboyant attendants at
last year’s Homecoming, spread-
ing gay autumn leaves before
their handsome hermaphroditic
Queen.

This is the point at which the
film’s statement and its tech-
nique merge: the images 7
sights and sounds ~ jam and
shift and overlap in exciting
ways. One voice picks up before
another has left off; neither
necessarily relates to what we
are seeing in any simple way.
What we are hoping for around
here, surely, is mix and move
ment, a simmering of the in-
tellectual, esthetic and Social
brew. That seems to be just what
the filmmakers found,

Only a few students attended
the two sneak previews I did.
When I asked them, afterwards,
what they thought, they mostly
said, “Like it is." Some of them
said it, though, with a giggle, as
when some certain nerve is
touched. Like that maiden who
was accustomed to brooding over

the plainness of her countenance;
shown her portrait, she saw that
the flaws were truly represented,
but she saw also that she was
a pretty good looker, at that, and
she was elated. Maybe the last
word comes from the voice in
the film that says, “Flawed, yes,
but compared with what? ”

I don’t think I am being ex-
travagant in my appraisal, but
then I’m not a student here. By
the way, it’s a h-~k of a lot more
fun to write a surly review than
a complimentary one.

Drug Symposium at Grinnell
Greg Dunn to be Committee Head

The Grinnell Symposium on
Psychoactive Drugs will be held
on campus February 4 and 5, The
conference is planned by students
to inform members of the college
community about effects of the
use and abuse of drugs.

Plans for the symposium em-
phasize informal sessions in
which students, faculty members
and advisers can meet and talk
with participants. The speakers
are scheduled to join students in
classes, at meals, and in informal
discussions. Each speaker will
also nresent a lecture followed
by a questionranswer session.

Greg Dunn, chairman of the
drug symposium committee, ex-
plained the purpose of the sym-
posium; “We’re trying to provide
a foundation of up-todate, faCr
tual information With this con
ference, but we’d like people who
participate to come away with
more than facts, If the symr
posium can get students, faculty
members, and the college's
administrators together to hear
each other out, well have taken
a big step toward defining the
problems of drug use and meet
ing them. As it is now, for fifteen
weeks of the semester everyone
pretends there are no problems.”

Plans also include several
films including “Speedscene:
The Problem of Amphetamine
Abuse.” “Research Report 7
THC The Chemistry of

Marijuana,” and “The Spring
Grove Experiment,” a C.B.S.
film .which traces patients
treated wtth LSD.

Guest speakers for the syme
posium include nationally
recognized leaders in research
and treatment with psychedelic
drugs, Dr, Samuel Irwin, a
psychopharmacologist at the
University of Oregon Medical
School will be on campus for the
event. His research includes
work on drug addiction, memory,
social behavior, and the predic»
tion of the elfect of drugs on man
on the basis of animal studies.

Dr. Walter N, Pahnke, Director
of Clinical Sciences at the Mary
land Psychiatric Research
Center at Spring Grove State
Hospital, will also speak. l-lis
areas of interest range from the
psychology of religion to the
clinical investigation of psycho
therapy assisted by psychedelic
drugs in alcoholic, neurotic.
narcotic addict, and terminal
cancer patients,

The third participant will
represent the Haigh shbury
Medical Clinic. The CI‘ c is a
volunteer, non-profit medical
facility which serves as a treat
ment and referral center for the
HaighteAshbury district of San
Francisco. Either Dr. David E.
Smith, Medical Director of the
Clinic, or Dr. John Frickman,
Chief of the Drug Treatment
Center, will be present.

TO THE EDITORS:

President Leggett, in his letter
to the student body last
December, stressed the need for
placing some kind of control on
student dissent at Grinnell. With
statements like these, one can’t
help feeling that Mr. Leggett will
earn the reputation of being
Grinnell’s answer to Spiro
Agnew. But does he deserve this
honor?

On a national level, the most
powerful dissent comes from the
mass media. We do not question
that there should be some con»

trots on the media, we question
rather — in the blinding light of
past Nixon Administration
idiocies 7 the ability of Agnew
to bc just mat control. But at
Grinnell, the nature of the
College environment leaves
entirely different possibilities for
the employment of dissent
control.

The majority of Grinnell
students‘ would agree that,
although some kinds of dissent
are beneficial — perhaps even
essential 7 some dissent's only
effect will be to harm the College
reputation and to help raise
tuition costs. The problem then
lies in finding a criterion or
council to decide which dessent
has purpose. In the past months
I have been annoyed by much
of the Grinnell protesting: it has
not been 7 unfortunately7 Come
munist inspired, but
spawned by these students’ own
desperate attempts at Liberal
Exhibition. However, as many
persons who read this letter will
disagree with me. I am probably
not the best judge of dissent
criteria. I propose rather that the
student body vote on certain
restrictive guidelines for type
(e.g. no profanity, no religious
or cultural defamation) and
place (e. g,, not during alumni
reunions ur Homecoming) of
public dissent at Grinnell.

1r dissenters were to lollow a
wise set of regulations, far lewer
parents and alumni would be
offended and we would look
forward to smaller tuition rates
and a more varied student body
inthe coming years.

Senate Meeting Held:

Reporter Pays a Vlsit
By Tom Greenfield

The sudden, but not altogether
unexpected, departures of
“penguin" Bill Stranger and
“pidgeon” Steve Schwartz left
SGA the unenviable task of find-
ing suitable replacements. in a
press statement, Student Co-
ordinator Frank Thomas an-
nounced, “Schwartz is irreplace
able. No plans are being made
to find another assistant student
coordinator,” Frank refused to
comment on rumors that plans
are being made to retire Sch»
wartz's blue denim workshirt in
the SGA office.

The senate rejected the elec-
tion board’s proposal to skim two
people off the top of the unre—
solved SilvermansCohen-Ward
contest in a runoff election
(thereby filling both Stranger’s
and Aldrich’s seats 7 so to
speak.) Andy Loewi claimed that
the procedure was “irregular.”
After tepid debate, a voice of
reason noted that the December
election could not legitimately
carry over for a new semester,
because freshmen are now
eligible to run for the senate. The
folk finally decided to fill Lynn
Aldrich's chair with the Winner
of yesterday’s election and Bill
Strangers chair with the winner
of next Friday’s election.

Frank Thomas opened dis-
cussion on “The Milk Thingy”
which referred to Saga’s blatant
attempt to subvert the students’
dietary freedom by putting low-
fat milk in the dining hall cows.
Frank insisted that there is a
student mandate for whole milk
on the Grinnell campus and
promised that his office would not
rest until every cow is pouring
out whole milk. Frank bowed
humbly to thunderous applause.

President’s Report Reviewed

In commenting upon the state
of the college in “The President's
Report,” Mr. Leggett described
the institutional and physical
dianges which have taken place
at Grinnell during the past year
and a half, As this report was
intended for an audience of
alumni and parents, it was
natural that he depict this in-
stitution in a generally favorable
manner. Accordingly, what were
considered ‘positive’ changes
were'emphasized while other
developments were glossed over.
Although I agree with his
analysis of Grinnell as an in-
stitution generally moving in a
positive manner to confront its
difficulties, severai areas of this
report deserve additional
comment.

President Leggett described

Folk Festival and
Workshop To Be Held

There is no need to go to
Newport or Woodstock to hear
authentic foTk music. One week
from today, the Social Coordir
nating Committee will sponsor a
two-day folk music festival here
in Grinnell. Ron Stanford, coordir
nator of the festival, has secured
over a dozen folk musicians and
four folklorists,'reaturing such
singers as Mother Maybelle
Carter of the famous Carter
family, Bukka white, Art Rosen»
baum, Glenn 0hrlin and Joe
Pazour; also John and Grace
Papakee, Keith Dempster and
Fred Martin. Although only
students of old-time traditional
folk music will recognize and
appreciate these names, anyone
can enjoy their music,

The program features a wide
variety of styles, including moun-
tain music, gospel singing, coun-
try and western music and ethnic
folk songs. The first formal
concert, in Robert's theatre, is
on Friday night, from 10:00 PM,-
12100 P.M.; the second on Saturr
day night, from 8:00 P.M.-11:00
P.M. However, the formal
concerts are only one part of the
festival. Informality will pervade
the folk music workshops in
South Lounge, to which all guitar
and banjo enthusiasts are in-
vited. Students will also be free
to meet and socialize with the
performers, who will live in the
dormitories and eat in the dining
halls,

the emotional climate of the
campus as one which, in general,
has been steadily improving
Justiiiably, he pointed to
renovations in buildings, im»
proved landscaping, and the
expansion of the bookstore as
exampies oi the ac-
complishments in this area, The
quality or the college's en
vironment, however, is deter»
mined by far more than land»
scape beautification and building
renovation. it is also dependent
upon adequate academic
facilities which enable the
community to proceed with the
process oi education. The im-
provement oi the bookstore
partially answers this need. It
is, however, difficult to justify the
expenditure of college Iunds on
a physical education complex
while students must rely on
private sources for books in order
to pursue research. Thus it
would seem that the coll'ege
environment might have
benefited more by establishing
the priority of increasing library
expenditures instead of im-
proving in landséaping and
physical education complexes.
Similarly, in a quotation from
Howard R. Bowen which was
cited in this report, Grinnell was
described as an “active, lively,
stimulating, and questioning
place.” Aithough this might
present a pleasing analysis tor
alumni and parents, it does not
bear up to close scrutiny. For

Finally, President Leggett’s

that it was necessary to decide
“what is clear and what isn’t,

'doesn‘t, what is workable and

Chekov’s ”The Three Sisters”
To Be Performed Later This Semester

Director Robert Ingham has
selected iiiteen students from
lhe thirty-five who auditioned for
the spring production or Chekov’s
“The Three Sisters.” Leading the
cast are Ricki Ravitts, Audrey
Vandercook and Patty L‘oeb, who
play thethree sisters, and Philip
Vaughan, Greg Wallance and
Ray Kantor who play the prinr
cipal male roles. Maunena Carter
is production stage manager.

Duringthe first four weeks, the
entire cast will attend seminars
given twice weekly by the
Russian and History Departs
ments, in order to acquire a
cultural and historical
background of eighteenth cenr
tury Russia. Following that, the
production will go into full
rehearsal with performances on
April 23, 24, and 25 and again
on May 29, 30.

“The Three Sisters,” con-

sidered by many to be Chekov's
greatest work, is chiefly a
psychological study of stultiiied
bourgeois characters and their
futile quest for happiness it
should be interesting to see how
Chekov‘s explanation of their
empty ambitions and apathy
stands in relation to the current
protest movement and alleged
apathy of today's college
students,

lngham chose this modern
classic primarily for the same
reason that Grinncll's guest
director John Ulmer chose “The
Playroom, is. the characters are
close to the actual ages of the
student actors who play them.
The elimination of the age
barrier allows the student to
concentrate on other problems of _
acting, and, with very successful
results, as evidenced by last
semester‘s performances.

Pianist Gives Excellent

Performance Before Small Crowd
By Kathryn Heinze

. The first Concert of the
semester was presented January
22 in Roberts Theatre by pianist
Nerine Barrett and it may go
down in the annals of history as
one of Grinnell’s more shameful
moments. For those of us who
complain about the cultural void
of the Iowa Cornfields, this
concert was a prime example of
why getting excellent performers
to come to.Grinnell is like pulling
impacted wisdom teeth. We
cannot ask reputable artists to
play to empty concert ‘halls or
on a poor piano. These-problems
were painfully evident on the
evening of Miss Barrett’s recital.
The attendance was so piddling
that any number of music
students could swear to have had
a better turnrout when they
played “Humoresque” at their
first piano recital, and God only
knows What the erratic action of
our twOVyearrold Baldwin did to
her playing.

In spite of these problems, the
hardcore concertrgoers were in
for a treat. Too often Grinnell
audiences are forced to put up
with a program heavily peppered
with renditions of hackneyed
music literature, Miss Barrett,

however, possessed the good
taste and the intelligence to
present a concert which con-
tained several rarely-performed
and interesting works.

She opened with Mozart’s “Ten
Variations in G on a Theme by
Gluck, ‘Unser dummer Pobel
Meint,’ K. 455,” and had Mozart
heard it, he would have leapt for
joy and smiled at the, heavens.
But in this Work as in the other
two Mozart selections that
followed 7 “Adagio in E minor,
K. 540” and Glgue in G, K. 57 ”
she had definite problems with
the piano. Several keys in the
middle register refused to
respond to anything short of a
good, hard poke. Consequently,
many of her chords were broken
and punctuated with facial
grimaces. It IS embarrassing to
find oneself slave to a faulty
instrument, and this realization
was of no help to her in the Schu-
bert sonata. Although the
“Sonata in A minor, Op. 143” is
a challenging work, her perform-
ance of it was technically solid.
Miss Barrett, howeva, seemed
to have difficulty relaxing into
the keys, and her pauses between
sections were uncomfortably
long. Whether this can be at-
tributed to nervousness or to her
own distinctive style of playing
ishardto say.

The second part of the program
provided Miss Barrett with
numerous opportunities to
display her impressive technique
and musicality. Her performance
of Ravel’s “Valses Nobles et
Sentimentales” told the audience
that she was more at ease. It
is a delightful piece, and she
captured its lilting rhythms quite
successfully. The recital ended
with Prukovief‘s ”Sonata in D
minor, Op. 14,” and I have no
complaints about this work: it
was well executed, and Miss
Barrett appeared to possess the
necessary strength in her playing
that aProkovief sonata demands.

It would have been worthwhile
for anyone to have attended this
concert. The works performed
were of definite merit, and Miss
Barrett is a young and promising

pianist. It is regrettable that her
recital was presented to an
audience of thirtyrfive people and
that she was forced to play on
a malfunctioning piano. Perhaps
little can be done about a small
audience, but the Baldwin could
be taken care of— the city dump
is six miles south oftown.

Lawrence Halls
May Serve Beer

A Lawrence University Com~
munity Council (LUCC) proposal
permitting dormitories to serve
beer during approved parties
held in the living units was signed
this week by President Thomas
S. Smith.

The proposal, under study by
a LUCC committee for me past
year, is directed at encouraging
the use of residence halls for so-
cial activities and at keeping
these activities on campus. Prior
to the enactment of the
legislation, social groups and
residence balls were holding
parties off campus at clubs where
beer was being served. This

- arrangement necessitated trans-

porting students to and from the
parties, and. in some instances,
limited the number of Students
who could participate in a party.

The legislation requires that
parties at which beer is served
must be approved by a majority
vote of the residents
and must be registered with the
Dean’s office. No more than four
parties per term may be held in
aliving unit.

Parties will be limited to the
common areas of the living unit
and beer will be served only
during times designated for a
party. The Dean’s Office wiu be
responsible for regulating the
program.

The swimming test will be
given on Monday and Wednesday
at 3:00 AM. and on Tuesday and
Thursday at 3:00 and 10:00 AM.
for the rest of the quarter. It is
necessary to pass this test to help
fulfill your physical education
reuuirement.

10 Against 4: Nationally Ran/(ell Holstra
Defeats Grinnell Wrestlers, 46- 0

A Letter to Cl
Young Man:

A Letter to a Young Man:

I write to you, young athlete,
of something most extraordi-
nary, which I feel I must share.
It may not be the case, nor indeed
would Iwant it to be taken so,
were it not; far be that from me.
But you see, my friend, a most
remarkable thing, as 1 may have
intimated before, seems to have
happened, or not, as the case may
be.

I seemed to lind myself in a
dank, warm, wet, and humid
room, of the sort with a grimy,
uncarpeted floor, quite lacking in
the most elementary armchairs,
and With lights in the ceiling (i).
It was utterly wretched. From
afar there waited towards me
intimations oi steam and (could
these ears decieve me?) the
sound of hoarse cries.

Can I properly describe to you
the stench of decay, the slimey
sweatsocks cast aside like so
many . . . . cast off sweatsocks?
Probably not. In any case it was
clear to me that l Wasin No Place
Meant For Man, Or perhaps in
The Place of Man, depending,
again, on your disposition in
these matters.

But peace, “Let me continue,
let the tale bide its own telling."
It is mine to be but an humble
Vessel, Now I knew where I
might be, and why Ihad come.

AsI moved to the far wall, lined
with steely lockers, my wretched
thoughts ran frantic: ”James’
‘Antique collossus’, perhaps? Or
perhaps not. Again it all
depends." (Fool that I was! i l)

I reached the wall in horrors

Cont. on P. 7

A tough and experienced
Hofslra wrestling team came

decisively defeated one senior,
two freshmen, and a sophomore
the Grinnell wrestling team. The
46-0 shutout was not unexpected,
given a fullyrstaffed and
nationally ranked Hofstra squad
and one from Grinnell which
spanned only four ol the eleven
classes.

As a matter of class, Hofstra
had it. The Grinnell Wrestlers are
out on the mat warming up or
talking to each other and the
University oi Iowa wrestler who
had come to fill out the program
with exhibition bouts. All of a
sudden, out comes Hofstra in
matched bathrobes. They're not
smiling, they’re not even looking.
What's more, they all have on
the same wrestling shoe, and the
soles curve up at the edges, and
it says ”Tiger" where it ought
tosay“U.S.KEDS.”

Chuck Farr at 118 lbs. was
Grinnell’s first entry. Although
apparently matching his op-
ponent in strength, and not much
outclassed in speed, Farr could
not avoid a pin from an obviously
Skilled opponent.

Grinnell forfeited the next
three weight classes, losing
points equivalent to pins against
them in each. Iowa takes one of
these on points, and Hofstra
cleans up the other two. By this
time the Grinnell spectators are
cheering for the University of
Iowa wrestlers.

Grinnell’s only returning let»
terman, senior Mason Klipple
excited a rather intent crowd in
a match, going all three rounds
with a rather Wells
matched opponent. Although
tiring in the second period,
rebounded to a position of ad-
vantage in the third, moving the

 

 

 

crowd to a round of hysteria.
Klipple spent some time on the
mat being choked and managed
to get up again late in the period.
This, sadly, was too late, and he
went down on points.

Alter another forfeit, Jim
Weiser, a freshman wresuing
abovehis usual weight class, took
the floor, but was dropped by
Hofstra at 2:06 into the first
period.

After some further defaults,
out comes Washington Alston,
clearly the baddest looking
wrestler of the evening. Although
going the full three rounds, he
never quite got into gear and
seemed unable to follow through
on a number of potentially
dangerous moves. This was far
and away the most exciting bout
of the evening, with the scores
just about evenly matched
through the second period. After
this, Alston seemed to slow down,

Swimmers Top Monmouth;

Final Meet Next Friday

For the last two years before
this, Monmouth has taken the
dual meet with us by winning the
last relay, heating us by one
point. Last June, however, it
Seems that almost the whole
Monmouth swimming team
graduated, the only exception
being David Lloyd, a cocky but
good swimmer (their captain this
year). He swam fairly well, but
he was the only bright spot on
the team. Monmouth won only
the two relays and the
backstroke, Lloyd being in on two
of their three wins.

‘ The meet was almost boringly
victorious (such a new thing tor
Grinnell athletics rendered it
exciting however). “Jolly Rally”
Bruce Rollins’ 200 breaststroke
pleased the crowd immensely, as
he would push off, coming out
of his turns. and not come up
for his first breath until he was
halfway down the pool. Since
Bruce had never swum the breast
stroke in competition, his win

was very impressive. A stroke
behind Bruce, Mike Bye turned
in his best time of the year in
that event. In the 200, Kelly swam
a 1255.0, for a new school and
pool record. Daley swam his
usual great and Mike Burkle did
an excellent job in the last relay,
turning in his fastest time this
season. Done Linke scored his
best ever in the diving, and I
turned in 231.50 points for mine.

No one was really pushed in
this meet, so overall we had a
strong but not tremendous
showing. Today we are at
Lawrence, in Wisconsin, lacing
our toughest competition of the
year. Tomorrow we are up
against Beloit, which shouldn't
pose as much of a threat. Our
only remaining home meet is
next Friday. Olaf will be here,
and it promises to be a good
meet. We have put together a
good team but we need support.
Come watch a winner for a
change.

and he folded on points.

Then followed the final, but
inevitable forfeit, this time of the
heavyweight class. Then it was
all over and they were folding
the chairs and putting the scoring
machine away, Washington
Alston took off his shoes and iay
down for a while on the gym mat
as the crowd trailed off.

This had been a match that
Grinnell could not really lose. We
were expecting an unmitigated

stomp, We could have fulfilled
this expectation, or bettered it,
but in no way could we have done
worse. Of our (our losses two
were on pins, but two got away
on points. More importantly the

Great Upcoming Hoistra Stomp
and work for good individual
records in the Midwest Con-

business with some honor, and

Grinnell Blades Tie State Icemen;
Hoopslers Split Two Road Games

The Grinnell Hockey Club tied
a previously undefeated and
untied Iowa State team 44 last
Sunday at the Des Moines Ice
Arena. Behind 472 with one
minute remaining in the game,
Grinnell slammed home two
goals within 15 seconds of each
other to earn the tie. The first
was placed on a rush by the
“Zippy Line" with Captain-Coach
Mike Schafler Scoring on a 15 foot
rebound shot. Bruce Graham and
John Omstad earned assists on
the goal. 15 seconds later the
tying goal was scored by Steve
Leighton with an assist by
Schaffer.

Leighton put Grinnell out in
front 1»0 in a breakaway in the
first period. Iowa State then
scored three consecutive goals,
but Graham brought Grinnell to
within one by evading the lowa
State defense to fire a ten foot
slap shot past their goalie.

Although Grinnell was outshot
26-16, goalie Jeff Dick, who is
averaging 29 saves a game,
kicked out 22 shots to preserve
the tie.

Ina game marked by excessive
roughness, a total of 26 minutes
in penalties was awarded. The
third period featured a fight

between Hemmingway of
Grinnell and Scheveny I.S.U.

Returning from a slew of road
games, Grinnell’s basketball
squad stands now at 274 in Mid-
west Conference play and 377
overall. The Pioneers divided 3
pair of games in Wisconsin last
weekend, topping Lawrence so
60, but losing out w a strong
Ripon team 90-73.

Grinnell put in a lesthhanA
superb performance at Law-
rence, although denting the
Vikings badly in the second half
with a strong front line. Behind
32730 at intermission, Grinnell put
in its best shooting display of the
season: Mout 0(54 from the field,
and 20 out of 23 from the line.
Sophomore Bob Burnett came
through with an especially imr
pressive showing, bagging 26
points and Zl) rebounds,

0n the other hand, Ripon out
performed the Pioneers. The
Redmen put on an outstanding
offensive performance in the first
half, hitting 21 of 33 attempts
from the field and building a vir»
tually unassailable 4977.7 lead.

Greg Bombinski led the Grins
nell team with 22 points, his high
for the season, while Burnett and
Hanson claimed 15 and 13 scores
respectively.

Grinnell‘s basketball team
starts a five game home stand
tomorrow night against Cornell.
