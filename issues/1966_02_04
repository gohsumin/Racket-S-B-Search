Senate Revamp Defeated

By ALAN AXELROD

The Senate lives on.

The proposal made by SGA
President Jerry Goddard which
sought to abolish the senate was
defeated Wednesday night 17-5.

Senator Dan Bucks opened dis
oussion of the proposal With an
explanation or his stand on the
proposal, “My opposition is not
based on romantic wishiulness for
the past. I feel that the goals of
the proposal such as improved
rule enforcement and increased
efficiency can he achieved in other
ways.

Bucks went on to express the
feeling that the proposed form
oi government would narrow the
range of participation in student
government by delegating all leg-
islative responsibility to the hall
presidents. He said that some of

the projects oi the Senate, such
as the committee investigating
admisslon‘s practices and the
distribution of course evaluation
forms. had been worthwhile and
that the senate has the ability to
function as an efiective legisla-
tive body.

At this point Bucks distributed
mimeographed copies of suggest-
ed changes in the organization of
SGA His suggestions entailed
three proposals: the return to a

senate composed of two represen-
tatives from each hall, the selec-
tion of the speaker of the senate
by the SGA president with approv-
al by the senate, and the power
to initiate proposals for changes
in conduct regulations and res-

Student Group Forms
7' Seek Bole (dodges

About thirty students — most or them freshmen —- met last night in
the South Lounge in the most recent of a series of “organizational" meet-
ings. The group is organizing what they call the “Grinnell Committee for
Student Involvement” and are interested primarily in rule changes at
Grinnell.

A steering committee met shortly before the main meeting and ape
pointed officers. The officers are: David Levine, chairman; Carl Bef-
liner, vice chairman; Kit Leder, secretary; and Richard Kaiser, treas-
urer, Chairman Levine explained that “we couldn’t decide who should
be voting members” and said that in a month or so there would be an
election by the entire group for officers,

Levine read the group's guidelines, calling the group “an organiza-
tion seeking to promote the active involvement of Grinnell students in
the important issues and decisions which aitect them."

The guidelines went on to say that “Grinnell students have the right
to maximum intellectual and social freedom and that this is nece ary
for the iull development of independence, maturity, and respons y.”

In order to reach these ends, Levine indicated that the organization
would work through committees, The committees named were “public
affairs, student government, social lules and action, faculty and admin-
istration, academic and coordinating,"

Levtne said that sometime early next week —- he wasn’t sure when‘
or where — the group would have a general meeting open to everyone.
When asked if the group was to have a limited membership he replied
that it would be limited “to whoever wants to join."

A journalist formerly from Ha-

saying that the Viet Nam war was
one of conquest and that China

Speaking on other topics the

Prof [ambush S&B's Unification
0f Student Socialslcademic Life

To the Editor:

Congratulations! Just when
Grinnell is threatened with total
Iubmergence in the cant of hyp»
ocrisy the S&B’s dynamic editor
comes through again. You are
quite right to take the faculty
and administration to task for not
having I coherent and uniform
view of students. Down with in-
dividuality and difference! Let's
quit kidding and equate social lite
completely with academic life
and stop trying to make meaning-
less distinctions within the sphere
of "academic experience” The
college authorities have departed
radically from their suspicious
view of the students, of whom they
always suspect the Worst, by
instituting the “credit-fail" sys-
tem. You have courageously
alerted everyone to this and sug-
gested it would be foolish to ex
periment and hope the students
would act with responsibility. Of
course they will abuse the system
and silly ideas that they Won’t
should not be allowed to masquer-
ade under the cover of a suppos-
Idl liberal experiment.

uwever, I also support you in
your call for a new unified view
or the students. Let us assume,
Is they so often tell us, that they
are far more mature than we give
them credit for. Let us abﬂlish all
grades and have a complete cred.
.It-fail system. Let’s get rid of the
hypocrisy of letters of recommen-
dation to grad schools and supply
each professor with a printed
sheet of paper (using a good

stock, of course) whore he can

 

fill in the name of the student
and then check either “recom-
mended" or “not recommended
for graduate Study.” 1 mean, after
all, either a student is or he or
she isn’t. No need for advisors —
who do little anyway but try to
im ose their views on students H
eit err students know what they
want.

Let’s carry this over to social
life, too. Abolish all rules and let
the lowa State Police and Liquor
Commission into the dorms to
handle that question. Forget about
having deans intervene with the
authorities if students get into
trouble, either on campus or
downtown. After all. students are
mature enou h not to need the
protection 0 a ”loco parent".
What is more hypocritical than
cutting our students off from the
way others live and thereby mak-
ing them rpeciall

Counseling emotional problems
and all that jazz are the business
of the students and the parents.
Let’s also make them responsible
for the repair and upkeep of their
living quarters, the way one is in
the real world. This would not
only cut down on the hypocrisy
but eliminate constant tension be
tween the students and 13ch (of
course it might take a while to
find something else to talk about).

in short, a loud hurrah for your
spproachl You didn't quite go far
enough and weren't quite logical
enough but that’s why we are here
~ to help pride you. Please enlist
one enthusiastic supporter and
guide.

Campus Politics, SGA

To the Editor:
The upcoming contest for the
SGA presidency promises to be
our first free, allcampus election
in three years. Since the spring
of 1954, two prospective candr
dates have been prevented from
running for this office by out-
right political intimidation. Cam-
paign costs have grown probi
five to many. Efform in last ycai
Senate to correct this abuse were
squelchcd by those whose mtcr
ests required the exclusion of
others from Sludent government.
The consequences of this neglir
genes are plain to see. The cam»
pus political structure has be
come a closed system, unrespon
sive to creative initiatives irom
the student body. As one example,
the Senate this year twice refused
to provide funds for the Des
Molnes Prolect, although more
than seven hundred students have
agrccd to support this effort by
a onetneal fast Also, no construc-
tivc response has been given to
lacully proposals for tho rciorm

of the hall system. Administra-
tion intervention in this matter
results from a failure of students
and their government to develop
and implement meaningful goals
in community living. One iaculty
member has trenchantly expressed
the current inertia in SSA: “Atter
me, llle delugel"

thn one rates present per.
formance in terms of past achieve
ment at Grinnell, the record of
the Goddard administration is dis
couraging. Coutrasted with the
pioneering guilds of students and
faculty who founded the univen
sittcs of Europe, the story be
comes positively ludicrous. Though
campus respect for our govern-
ment has seriously deteriorated,
one may hope that certain immc
dials changcs by a vigorous 2dr
ministration can reverse the
trend.

The Grudge Pot

In this age of democratic concern over the surplus
quantifies 0t loudstutls that are such an ironic waste
and expense, it is surprising that another sorely-
pressing surplus has been long ignored by the Ameri.
can public. Such august societies as the D.A,R. and
the P.T.A. have no official viewpoint on the subject,
and even recently relevant information has been
scarce.

The problem, of course, is that of an excessive
number of corpses. Doubt of the severity of the prob-
lem now fills most of the even well-informed public
with apathy, and the peace and quiet of contem-
porary cemeteries seem to after a gentle reassur-
ance.

But the truth can be found in the August edition
of The Mortlcian’s Digest (p. 23): “ The corpse sur-
plus is the gruesome counterpart ol the population
explosion . . . it has reached almost epidemic pro-
portions . . . soon our graveyards may look like over-
piled junkyards.”

A serious side-effect, which ultimately may ruin
our medical profession, is the large number of Cadav-
ers now being supplied to medical schools. Jerome
Heart, dean of Jack Hopkins, has much to say on
the subject.

“This Situation is really awtul! It's unbearable.
So many people nowadays think they are doing the
one good deed of their lives when they give their
bodies to science, but they're really just fouling up
our whole program.

“Here at J. Hi we have so many cadavers that we
have to keep our boys up half the night, carving and
slicing and digging away. As you know, you can’t
keep a dead body forever like a can of beans. And

you Can't look a gilt-horse in the mouth, either. So
there we are, stuck With heaps of wrinkly little old
ladies and (at old codgers and such.

“If these people really wanted to do their country
some good, they would live longer. Or they could go
somewhere inconspicuous to die. At least, then, they
would not add to the problem.“

Enlightened commentators on the Situation have
seen some promise in the government's recent recog-
nition of the problem. Through Such modem tech
niques as the war in Viet Nam, bodies are deliveied
to foreign lands and are legally and judiciously disa
posed otr

specialists have noted the extreme suitability of
rice-paddies for mass burials, and the government
has further out the expense of the project by elimi—
nating cold-storage and sending the bodies over
while still alive.

Yet, the disposals in Viet Nam are only a drop
in the bucket when placed in the perspective of the
entire population The Dead Menace still exists, and
if current tlends continue unchecked, by the year
2050 every man, woman, and child can look lDrWald
to only three square inches in which to be buried.

“What can I do?" the responsible citizen must
ask. if only man had the lemming instinct and ran
to the sea, or it he were an elephant with one llllal
resting ground, the citizen could act.

The lasting solution now lies only in the hands of
him whose linger rests over the nuclear button. The
natural and harmonious proportions of mankind can
be restored only by such a purge of fire. Let us pray
that that day comes before our progeny have no

place at all to call a grave

Swee Discussion of Lack of Privacy

To the Editor'

As was r ‘ognized in Miss
Ku‘schnel’s letter, there 13 )1 ba-
Sic disparity between what this

college purports in do and what
it really does. Tllis is to be ex»
pected. No one can blamc the col-
lege [or trying to present the best
tillage it can. Wth is sad IS that
the catalog is the only basis in
choosing a college to which to
apply. This, of course, leads to
the obvious disappointments But
it seems to me that more is no
leaoon Why the college can't be
made to live up lo its projected
image more fully. i would like
to discuss the main areas of Stu-
dent life, namely study and social
lunctlons, with this lll mind,
Now, while it is true that me
collcge provides a number of
placos to study outside of [he stu»
uenls’ rooms, it is also true that
these areas could be both im-
proved and enlarged upon. For
me, the noisy. glary library does
not have the proper atmosphere
for study. This could be remedied,
partly by more cooperailon on the
part oi the administration to can
[ml the noise level of the offices
situated ill the basement and the
first floor. Purl. of the library's
problem lies in its modern glass
structure. To me. a library is a
place in which you can look for
it certain kind of isolaliun. The

 

large glass windows prevent you

 

from getting any sense of privacy,
except In a few selected seats hid-
deli among the books upstairs.
The glare of the lights also pre-
vents isolation. The glare pro»
duccs an atmosphere of noise and
trivolity, instead of the more aus-
tcro, l'elinell mood of a good li-
brary. Curtains and softer lights
with individual desk lamps could
help here

The rooms in A RH. and Good-
now are not really meant for
studying. The seats in Ah H. are
uncomfortable while the lighting
in Goodnow is poor, The rooms
in the Science building and Car.
negie are excellent. My only com»
plaint is that there aren’t nlore of
them, I say this even though I
know for a iact that they are nev-
er very full. This is because the
feeling of privacy is ruined if
more than a few people are in
these small rooms, Although the
South Lounge is sometimes used
for studying, students should not
feel that they have to whisper
there, for it was originally in-
tended for informal conversation.
It's up to the students themselves
to bring this about

As the college offers the stu-
dents certain places to study. so
does it offer them certain places
to talk. There are many places
where two people can talk a1»

levine, Woods Discuss inconsistency
In Policy on Restrictions, Freedom

To the Editor:

it appears to us that there are
A number of inconsistencies in
regard to certain social rules at
Gl'lllnell. On the one hand the coir
loge purports to develop respon-
sibility in its students and on the
other hand shows a distrust of
their own Judgment by imposing
lnany unwarranted restrictions

For example, we are regularly
allowed open dorms for only three
hours on Sunday afternoons. Why
so infrequently? We regard open
dorms as not only an occasion for
couples to be alone but also as an
opportunity for groups of friends
to get together informally. More
open dorms would permit freer
interaction between men and
women,

Another example oi the col-
lege's failure to treat students as
mature individuals is the policy
or hours for women, reinforced by
the nightly locking of the loggia.
It' a girl is to learn to be respon-
sible in her actions she must be.
gin by determining her own re-
strictions as she has to away from
Gi‘inllell. We recognize the con-
cern for the saioty of the female
population. However, the locking
out of ‘undesirahles' should not
necessitate the locking in of the
women. Therefore we suggest
some sort of system whereby the
women are given keys to at least
one door of the loggia, so that
they may come and go at their
own discretion.

These are the most prominent

I was both heartened and appalled by Sandy Mc»
Cortney Ehlers’ letter in the January let 5&3. it
was all about Grinnell as a place to “face your-
self,” but Mrs. Ehlers seems to have Grinnell con-
tused with some curiously idyllic combination of
both troglodytlc and pastoral ieatures. Thurtun
wilder once said that “the price one pays lor a love
that cannot integrate its hate is sentimentality";
think this may be the problem,

It's possible to talk about SAGA load with a can
tall] bemusemeiu, and it’s possible to look beyond
the architectural Catastrophe Called Norris Hall to
the North and see a “barn dotted Countryside." But
if this is your preoccupation, you won’t really be
facing the important issues; all you'll be facing
Wlil be some petty considerations about an institu-
tion which all too often has a penchant tor pettiness.

Mrs. Elllers writes of spending ”four years
tucked away , . . iinding what makes you tick”
and my real quarrel is this “tucked away” business
~ as if the process toward maturity were a bed-
time story told at length and at leisure, amidst a
rustle but dainty privacy out in the sticks. Shades
of Thoreau we then must be, full grown as freshmen
With nothing beiore us but the ruminations at our
sensitive hearts and introspective intellects. Mrs.
Elllers end wilbur Jenks ought to get together.

The trouble is that growing up is a definition of
oneself, is convincement of being and sexuality by
the process of mutual exclusion. We ﬁnd ourselves
by eliminating other possibilities. Fortunately or un-
fortunately, this process has become so protracted
is our socidpsycholugical time that the administra-
tion's alternative is calling a halt and allowing the
student to pout about it in a suspended state or ado-
lescence. But a committment to the process of mu-
tual exclusion is a committment to action, to an ex-
pansive son of exploration through a certain inevit-
uble amount of chaos and confusion. Resolving per-

CLOSE YOUR EYES IF YOU MUST!

This may h. the mat [honking motion piotun you have "or count

at large", with passion and lust - getting on with
the whole hassle of Selfrdeflnltlon in an active, vital
way.

Consequently, anyone who has the nerve to ad-
minister a modern college must have the nerve
to tolerate conﬂict and disparity. Educatinn is no
more a function of grace and gentility than it is a
function of boredom and denial, The process of
maturatlon is, traditionally, too much for ordinary
society to take, because ordinary society, especially
in our time, usually ignores or procrastinates issues
which impatient. impulsive, garrulous youth simply
must resolve.

If this all sounds like quite a strain on your more
neat, orderly kinds oi people, the process has its cer-
tain advantages, To echo Dwight MacDonald, “The
past cultures 1 most admire have mostly been pro-
duced by communities, and remarkably small ones
at that. Also remarkably heterogeneous ones, riven
by (action, stormy wuh passionate antagonisms.”
Out of dlsparlty and multiplicity you get a contlnu-
ing atmosphere of vitality, productivtty, creativity
and fulﬁllment.

Mrs. Ehlers speaks for “the odd ones" and on
poses Mr. Schifi, but i wonder which of them knew
Grinuell oddly, as an exciting, stimulating place. I
can imagine both, perhaps, but i wonder what each
would think of a relum visit and a current impres-
sion of the Grinneli atmosphere, an atmosphere
which professors explicitly name as their reasons for
imminent departures, an atmosphere with apathetic
acceptance of a rigid social structure and a same-
ness among students. It's always been curious to
me how the more exciting and stimulating, Vital
student always manages to eventually disappear;
I've heard that the Burling boys provide free lifts
to the bus station. Meanwhile, it i may be permitted
to speak of the absurd, 3 large segment of the
faculty seems to be horrified because the institu-
tion’s inmates have a hostile attitude toward their
cages.

Sill-Year Thai Scholar
Writes of Spirit Cult

To the Editor:

As school in Thailand draws to
a close for another year, 1 wish
to relate to the Grinnell students
some of my experiences during
the past year and a half. During
this time I have been teaching
English at The Prince Royal‘s
College in Chiengmai. l teach 9th
grade boys. and llth and 12th
grade coeducational classes. The
teaching is quite frustrating at
times because of the poor English
foundations of some of the stu-
dents. At P.R,C., English is
taught from the second grade on,
and is a required subject. The Stu
dents study from five to eight
hours a week. The program looks
good, but the Thai educational
system allows students to pass a
whole year's work on an over-all
average. Therefore, if a student
does well in Boy Scouts, agricul-
ture,_and art, and fails English,
he still passes on to the next grade
with no foundation for the next
year’s English work.

Aside from this problem, how-
ever, the life has been very inter-
esting. It would be impossible for
me to measure the knowledge that
I have gained. At a glance, Thai-
land seems to be a fairly well Ile-
veloped country. If one only vis-
ited Bangkok, the capitol, he’d
think that he were in any big city

tour

 

with its trafﬁc problems, bl;
buildings, and commercialization.
Even in Chiengmai we see a great
deal of Western influence. In the
Lime 1 have been here, new, modi-
ei‘n hotels h ve arisen; Honda:
and automobi es have replaced bi-
cycles; translstor radios are heard
in all of the stores blaring Amer-
ican rock ’n' roll music; television.
are coming into more homes;
Western styles in clothing are re-
placing the simple Thai dress;
and men’s and women's hair styles
are copied from the latest style
magazines.

The longer one lives in Asil,
however, the more one realized
the culture is not the same as in
the West. There is a slow, tropi-
cal pace of lile. It is quite (asb-
ionahle to be late for appoint-
ments, or not to appear at all
without notice. The students arc
not used to responsibility, and or.
ganization is very unorganized.
Their attitudes toward life, death,
and sickness are quite foreign to
our way of thinking because many
of them are Buddhists. Buddhism
is the national religion.

I recently had an opportuhltz
to attend a meeting with a “spirit
medium, Most Thai believe i-

as a mud-raising project for the
group, The fast will be held on

Friday night Feb. 25, and will nei

the group $230.

The idea of a fast as a fund-
raising pi'olect began last year
when the Civil Righis group made
an agreement with SAGA. The
terms of the pact were that the
group would receive 5.40 in each
person idsiing, and 5.60 each if
enough students fasted to allow
one dining room to be closed (700
siudenls) This year, however, SAr
GA reiused [0 give any funds un-
less 700 students fasted. Although
the required number agreed, and
Cowles dining room will be closed,
SAGA will allow only $.40 per sub
dent for lhis fast.

The refund from SAGA will be
used to support project leader
Billy King and to furnish trans-
pnrtalion to Des Moines (or the
ihiny Grinnellians participating in
the program.

Current goals are establishment
of a “tenants’ union” and im-
provement of housing conditions
in Walnut Hills, the area of Des
Moines in which the group is
working.

Dona/toe Stages a Living Drama

By SUE BAUMER

The audience sat waiting for the
play to begin, while the cast
milled around, as if it tau was
waiting for something to happen—

perhaps the entrance of the main
actor.

A casually dressed, bearded
man, holding a cigarette, saun~
tered in and then began the drama
nf the drama.

The bearded mali, none other
than Ned Donahoe (speech and
theater) brought to us, an aiidie
enoe of reporters for the Sim, dur-
ing a rehearsal of the. coming
play, Antigone, not only the drama
of the play itself, but also the
drama of director and actors
working together.

able time searching for words as
does a person when trying to ex-
plain something accurately,

The plot at Antigone by Jean
Amourlh is adapted from the
Greek play or the same name by
Sophocles. it has the same char-
acters as the Greek play, but the
language and dress is modern.
The problem or resolving one’s
individual conscience with the dice
tates of the state or society forms
the core of the play. This problem
is obvtously a universal one, dwelt
with by Thoreau in "Civil Disn-
bedience,” Plato in his “Diae
logues,". and applicable to Civil
Rights and the viet Nain situa-
tion today.

The ancient Greek play Anti-
gone involves two sons and two

and Ihe cast. Donahoe alternated
between talking to us, playing a
role, and actually directing the
scenes. The problem that came up
during a rehearsal were to us,
very nontheater-orientated people,
ones that we have never consider-
ed.

For example, she Monto, who
plays Antigone, and Ken Hicks,
who plays Haeinon, the son of Cre-
on, must embrace in one scene
for a Considerable lime (as em—
braces go) and the problem arises
as to what they are to do during
that time, so that they appear
natural and so that the right ento-
Iion is Created, but there is a limit
to what one can do on the stage. ..

Although the set for this play is
very simple, consisting oi tour

THE SISTERS ANYIGONE AND ISMENE {Sue Manic. Becky Hill] run through rehearsals oi
Jean Anhouil's Antigone with director Ned Donahoe (speech and theatre]. Antigone opens
in Robert; Theatre Saturday. February 12.

Rehearsals for Antigone are be-
ing held in Arena Theater, which

is a square-shaped room, very
self-'contairied and smug. it a room
can be that. Most rooms are con-
nected to other rooms or halls,
hut Arena Theatre appears to the
person inside to be “self-suffi»
Clem." Donahue came in five or
ten minutes after we did, but
while we were outsiders in the
room, he was very much a part
ofit.

Before the rehearsal started,
Donahoe tried to explain the
meaning of the play to us, and
how the scenes we would see dur«
ing the rehearsal would relate to
this meaning. He was very earnest
in his explanation. as if the play
were his "baby” and he wanted
to see it treated right by the
press, but also because we were
part ot that great mass called au-
dience that a director is always
trying tn reach, He spent consider-

brother-in-law Green, who is now
king of Thebes. The two brothers
have killed each other as a result
of civil war. Creon, supposedly
tor the sake ot justice and order,
but actually for political reasons
has ordaitiéd that one of the
brothers be left unburied—Carrion
tor dogs and vultures, Antigone,
one of the sisters, defies the edict
and Duties the corpse because
she believes it must be done for re-
ligious reasons.

As we watched the play, Dona-
hoe pointed out to us the impor-
tant lines and cmcial scenes. He
was so involved in the play him-
self, that we were led. almost
dragged into involvment also. Al-
though it was a rehearsal, with a

ness and interruptions, the power
at the play did come through both
generally and in the important
lines. perhaps the key line of the
play is the statement by Antigone:
“And what a person can do. a
person must do."

But even more “grabbing" than
the play itselt was the rehearsal.

The rehearsal started late be-
cause Max Heltgott, who is the
Chorus, neglected to wake up in
time fui‘ if. It is possible that he
never did wake up completely.
When the rehearsal started we
found ourselves watching the play
itself and another play created by
the exchanges between Donahoe

 

chairs, a table and a bench, the
actors must still get around it,
rather than walking through it
(although they did try this).
Bruce McConachie, who as Creun
has a rather villainess role, was
forced to jump straight over the
bench at one point and you could
almost see the sword flashing and
his eyes glinting—if you can im-
agine Bruce McConachie's eyes
glinting.

Antigone will be presented Feb-
ruary 12 and 13.

Shender felt that under Gori-
datd’s proposal, the hall presi—
dents would be heavily burdened
with added responsibility and
would have' more difficulty in
functioning in their roles as liall
leaders. He also expressed tear
that the presidents would be

He then gave his evaluation of
the role of student government.

Heiibron explained his change of
heart with the View that “People
who support abolition of student
government are those who are ig-

who break the rules most often.
If the new proposal is adopted,
it will alienate good people iiom

the Senate is a place where tal-
ented, cieative people can provide
their services.”

Before the proposal was defeat»
ed, Goddard said he was very
gratiiied that people inside and out-
side of the Senate have been
moved to giving some serious
thought to the future of student
government, “I think if we culi-
sider ourselves a governmental

there is a job to be due, rather
than a game to he played.”

Defends Draft Card Burning:
Sets Up Memorial Scholarship

“I burned my draft card to cre-
ate a dialogue about the war in
Viet Nam," said Steve Smith, for-
merly a University or lowa stu—
dent, in a speech at the State
College or iowa justil‘ying his rad-
ical action. He ielt the burning of
a draft card was a symbolic pro-
test against the war.

“It the government prohi ts
dralt card burning, it is prohibit-
Ing the right of tree protests Free
speech, including free protest, is
tlle backbone of a democracy."

"The word ‘un—Amerlcan' should
be applied only to those who deny
the freedom of speech” Smith felt
that laws against drait card burn-
ing were comparable to suppres-
sion of free speech and in opptr
sition to the first amendment.

“The draft card is only a piece
of paper. I’ve never heard of any~
one being put in prison ior burning
a piece of currency.” Smith con-
cluded that he would go to jail if
drafted.

On January 4. 1966, Samuel
Younge, jr., a Tuskegee institute
student was murdered while para
tictpating in a civil rights activity.
Since Tuskegee and St. Olaf are
sister schools, the students at St.
Olaf decided to set up a memorial
scholarship for a Tuskegee stu<
dent for a single year as an ex—
pression oi their sympathy.

A fast of one meal was the
manner in which St, Olat's parlia-
ment decided to raise the scholar-
ship money. They then solicited

names of students who would do
without their noon meal for a 5in<
gle day. The result was a limited
number of donors who would iast
out of desire not convenience.

It was then decided that the
breakfast fast would receive Wider
support. which it has. The only
trouble, as the St, Olaf paper
points out, is that the additional
donors gained by changing the
time at the fast to breakfast are
those who sleep through it any-
way.

Second, the North Campus resi-
dence system must be made more
ﬂexible. It has become too self-
contai ed, generating its own anti-
intcllectual ethos. An annual ro-
tatlon of students based upon in-
dividual choice would counteract
this tendency and encourage an
outlook which encompasses the
entire college community. Yet the
advantages or the hall system in
providing a focus 01 identity for
incoming freshmen and serving as
a means or local government must
be preserved. Thus house presi-
dents on North campus must con-
tinue to be elected by the resi-
dents of each llall. Also, there
should be no discrimination ac-
cording to class in the residence
system. Freshmen have had an op-
portunity to demonstrate leader-
ship within an integrated campus;
they should not be isolated as
second-class citizens.

Abolition of the Senate is in-
advisable, since the CofHP and
the AWS Board tend to concern
themselves only with domestic
regulations and lack experience
in iulfilling other areas of stu-
dent concern, Rather, a new Sen-
ate should be composed of all
presidents. plus an equivalent
number of representatives elected
at large, who would serve as
spokesmen for the whole elector-
ate. Legislation could be initiated
within the Senate or by the Cofl-iP
and the AWS Board noting sepa~
rateiy. Passage of major campus
regulations would require en-

always walking in and out, and
tor another, the lounges are cer-
tainly not centrally located, Also,
a number of them serve as T.v,
rooms which excludes all other
activity. A solution to this lack
at places to talk could be the open-
ing of Gardner lounge to men.

A better solution to this prob-
lem would be having daily open
dorms, There are many pros and
coils concerning this issue which
I would rather not deal with now.
I would only like to try to correct
what seems to me an erroneous
view which thc (aculty and ad-
ministration hold, It is my im-
pression that the faculty and ad-
ministration leel that the students
want extended open dorms purely
for sex. This is not the case! Even
now, with our limited weekly open
dorms many of them are used for
parties of more than two people.
In tact, I would say that most at
them are used in this manner.
Daily open dorms would provide
a place where the students could
go and talk without being dis-
turbed.

The college must recognize that
it cannot lump all of its students
together in one group as “stu-
dents.” If the college provides
Iacillties for those who can study
with noise, then it must also pro-
vide facilities tor those who can't,
If the college provides facilities
for those who enjoy talking ahovo
noise, as in the North Lounge or
the Grill, then it must also provide
facilities for those who enjoy talka
ing in a more relaxed atmosphere.
Even if it doesn’t truly believe
that all the students are “respon.
sible adults," as it says it does, it
must still provide 101' those who
are.

Until the faculty and the admin-
istration lose their seemingly
basic disinterest of the students,
this will never be accomplished.

} Spirits
(Ctmlimml from PI 8)

spirits; they worship and tear
them. Even the Christians ivili
say, "I don’t believe in them, but
I’m afraid of them " The husband
of my Thai language teacher died
recently at age so. He and his
wiie were Christian, but his 1am.
iiy is Buddhist. His mother feared
that his spirit might need some»
thing. so she arranged a meeting
with a medium. near a waterfall
about twenty kilometers from
Chiengmai. The mother insisted
that the wife go, as she thought
that her son’s spirit would not re.
turn unless she were there. Out
oi fear, 1 think, the wife invited
several interested 'i‘arang‘ (for.
eign) Christians to attend the
meeting. She insisted she did not
believe in spirits, but neverthe
less, was very nervous.

We left Chiengmai around 8:30
am. tor what seemed to be a pie
nic. Everyone was in a gay mood.
and they had taken tood for a
lunch afterwards at the waterfall.
When we arrived at the home of
the medium, a typical Thai home
on stilts, we found that there was
a couple there ahead of us and
we were invited inside to witness
another spirit’s return. The me.
dium appeared to be a woman
around fiity years old. She had
on a cloth turban and a long Thai
pacin (skirt). She was supposed
to have the spirit of an old man
within her and was speaking to
the people in a deep, cracky voice.
After a short time, these people
ieit and the people in our group
began talking to the medium. The
tamily had brought many belong.
ings of the deceased, such as sev-
eral sets at clothing, and personal
articles. They also brought food
to feed his spirit if it appeared
and was hungry. They had ﬂow-
ers and joss sticks (incense) to
place on the spirit altar in the
room.

The medium began by asking
the tamily the deceased’s name.
She then took the elements of Buil-
dhist worship the yellow, round
piece of wax, candles, ﬂowers, and
'oss sticks, and held them in her

and. She prayed at the alter for
some time. Suddenly she gagged
and made strange noises. She then
turned to the group and said some
things. (She spoke in the north.
ern Thai dialect which 1 don't un-
derstand because 1 study the eerie
tral, ofﬁcial language.) As she
spoke, she wrote with one finger
in a handkerchief which she held
on her’ lap. She was now sitting
in the Buddha position. She
would often yawn, gag, and spit.
The tamily answered questions in
a misleading manner. in order to
test the reliability of the medium.
For instance, they gave the wrong
day and place ot death. After per.
haps thirty minutes had passed.
the woman sent her helper out to
buy candles for the altar. During
this waiting period we learned
that the medium was fiityefour
years old, and has been a medium

since the age of eighteen Dur-_

ing the intermission many in our
group walked around, ate truit or
iricd pork skin (our substitute for
potato chips), and talked. When
the candles were given to the me»
dium, we were told that they had
to be altered to the spirit of the
land, to request permission for
another spirit to be called there.
Once this was done the medium
again gagged and prostrated her
self before the altar, She then
selected a turban, pncin, and
scarf (ditferent from the oucs
worn lor the first client) and put
them on over her clothes. Then

Wins Even Record,

Wrestlers Are 4-4'

Griltnell evened its dual meet
record at 4-4 last Saturday with a
pair of victories over Knox and
Iowa Wesleyan. The gl'applers
whipped Knox 31711 and blanked
Wesleyan 530. Mike Mal‘tinson,
Joel Richman, John Sharpe, Ray
Mendel, and Jeff Patterson scored
wins with Sharpe and Patterson
pinning. Gary wilson drew with
his opponent while Bill Barnes and
Ken Strublel‘ won by forfeit.

The 53-0 score against lowa
Wesleyan was the highest ever Ill
Pioneer wrestling and only 2
points from a periect mark. The
results need some qualiilcation,
however. as Grinnell received six
forleits. Four of the other five
matches were pins by Barnes,
Strubler, Richman, and Sharpe;
Martinson won by a 5-2 decision.
Ricllman scored the quickest fall
oi the day in a time or 1:22. Also
recording tast pins were Sharpe in
his second match in 1:30 and Pat-
terson in 1:45 against his Knox op-
ponent.

Record-Breaking Ways

Frantz cracked the record early
in the second half, collecting points
number 1,104 and 1,105 on a 25sl00t
jump shot. He added 1|) more the
rest of the game.

With 11 games still to play this
campaign, the Pioneer cocaptain
should be able to raise the mark
to the vicinity of 1,350.

Earlier in his Seyear career
(freshmen do not compete in var-
sity sports), Jeff wrote school
records (or most points in a sea«
son (509), best season average
(23.1), most field goals in a season
(208), most points in a game (46),
and most field goals in a game
(22).

His 391 points as a sophomore
also established a new standard.

In addition to his prolific scor-
ing, Frantz ranks as one or Grin-
nell's all-time top l'ebounders, 512

trial for us."

The Pioneers used only two sub-
stitutes in the whole game and
neither or them scored. Along with
Frantz, three others reached dou-
ble figures. They were forwards
Ted Risser and Tom Hill and guard
Elliott Hibbs.

The leading scorers for Augus-
tana were Gordon Kinkead with 14
and freshman Steve Snow with 17.
Another freshman Bob Hogdon
notched 10 and barely missed a
last-second shot to tie the game.

Defense remains the Pioneers’
number one problem, according to
the coach,

“We didn’t play well defensively
against Augustana," he declared.
“We had too many lapses, includ-
ing a very bad one at the end.
Several times we got ahead by
six or seven points and then let
Augustana catch up because our
defense faltered."

Pfitsch will stick with the start-
ing lineup he has used the last
three games —- Ted Risser and
Tom Hill at forward, Frantz at
center, and Elliott Hibbs and Mike
Schwartz at guard.

All tive are averaging in double
