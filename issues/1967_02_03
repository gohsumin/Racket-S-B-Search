New Town Branch to Open

Mental Health Clinic Coming;
Will Serve Grinnell Students

By Paul Nachman

Establishment of a mental
health clinic in Griiinell awaits
only the hiring of personnel
to staif it, The new facility will
be available to students.

The Poweshiek County Men-
tal Health Clinic, to be located
in the Grinnell Community HDS~
pital, will be more accessible
[0 students than the Jasper
County Mental Health Center
in Newton, which currently
serves the college.

County otticiais are present-
ly seeking a fullntlnie psycholo-
gist and a halt-time social
worker for the new clinic, to
be a branch at the Jasper
County center, Di: Leroy K.
Bel‘i‘yhill, director and staff
psychiatrist in Newton, will head
the joint operation.

Associate Dean R i c h a r d
H. W i n t e r s explained
that Poweshiek County will not
get a fully-staffed mental health
center because the county's
19.000 population base is too
small to iinancially support
the necessary psychiatrist. in-
stead, the Gl'innell iacility will
be a inst-step clinic for stu-
dents and for county resrdetits.
Each patient will make at
least one trip to the Newton
center for consultation with Dr.
Berryhill, although protracted
treatment may be administered
by the Grinnell stuti after the
evaluative examination in New-
um.

Winters noted that the col-
lege has encouraged the estab-
lishment of a clinic in Grinnell
since 1963, when it helped pro-
vide ﬁnancial backing tor in-
itiation of the Newton center,
“There is increased incidence
of need among students for
psychological and psychiatric
care,” he continued,

Winters attributed this in-
creased incidence to the great»
er pressures on today’s stu«
dents, chieily grades, parental
expectations and worries about
graduate school, as well as
heightened popular awareness
or psychological problems

Winters commented that stu<
dents desiring psychological
consultation have the option or
going directly to the clinic it
they don't want the college
administration to know about
their problems, Most students,
though, are referred to the
clinic through the deans’ oi-
fice. "We don’t tell any stu-
dent he must go unless it is
a critical case," the dean em»
phasized. The college pays the
fees for a student's initial 3-6
Visits to the clinic.

Citing iigures tor the last
three and a halt school years,
Winters noted that approxi-
mately 40 students use the
Newton facilities each year,
each student averaging three
interviews. However, the num<
ber of staifrhours the Newton
center devoted to Grinnell stu-

dents jumped from about 140
in both 1963-64 and $64-65 to
190 in 196566

Twenty-nine students used the
Newton center during the fall
semester for a total of 98
staii-hours, indicating another
substantial increase for this
year, With the opening of the
new Grinnell clinic, Winters
anticipates increased student
use of mental health counsel-
ing “it (or no other reason
than greater convenience.”

At a Monday night meeting
in the Gi'innell Veteran Mem«
orial Center, Dr. Berryliill laud-
ed the Poweshiek County Men-
tal Health Association and the
county's Board oi Supervisors
tor the steps taken to initiate
the Poweshiek clinic. The su<
pervisors, at the urging of the
Mental Health Association,

Probable Hours Change Affirmed

Leggett Tells Committee Position;
Final Decision Comes in Spring

By Don Winney

In a formal statement to the senate Wednesday President Legs
gett announced the recommendation of the FCSA to abolish wom-
en's hours, The President said he and the trustees would consider
the proposal and that a decision on the matter would be made

public in the spring.

“1 have concerns about some
aspects oi the proposal,” the
Prestdent said. “but at the
minimum, I expect to take an
aiiil'mative attitude on the mat-
ter of some liberalization in
women's hours." Any new pol-
icy, he said, would take effect
next tall,

The President spoke inform-
ally of the college’s plans ior
the future, both academic and
physical. Mentioning the plans
for a recreational and service
complex. he said, “Darby Gym-
nasium would be redesigned
as a group recreational space
tor bowling, ping pong, and
other activities.”

A women's residence hall,
Leggett said, is being planned
for 150 students, 75 of whom
are now on campus. The hall
will be an extension of Loose
Hall, and the additional space
will provide tor new lounge
areas on South Campus. The
renovation of existing residence
halls is also under considera.
tion as is the construction of
a new men's hall sometime in
the future

The President announced a
proposed iive year program to
raise Ill-12 million dollars {or
the college. Half of the money
will be used for physical con-
struction, the other half for
faculty salaries, new depart-
ments such as an East Asian
one, and liberalized loan and
scholarship programs for stu-
dents

”As college costs rise," said
Mr. Leggett, “we must realize
the danger of attracting stu-
dents only irom the upper mid.
dle class. Grinnell has always
welcomed students from all
social backgrounds,"

The President said the fac-
ulty's educational policy com»
mittee will “hopefully” make
recommendations to him by
June on how to relate Grin-
nell's commitment to liberal
education to the need tor pre-
professional education.

Associate Dean Winters then

Winters also spoke frankly
about the tiring ot the house

The senate also appropriated
$50 to help tinance SGA Fresh
dent Steve Kent’s trip to Wasti-
ington to see Secretary of stats
Dean Rusk, The appropriation
was approved on the condition
that Kent give a public state-
ment on his trip when he re.

dent government presidents
expressing reservations on the
Vietnam War.

Progress —

Progress is a term hard to define and harder to apply. Never»
theless, several events of the past week have pointed to the
evolution of a climate more hospitable to the often agonizinz pro-
cess of student maturation. Certainly the initiation of community
action toward bettering the Grinnell environment represents pro-
grass.

The impending establishment of a Grinnell branch of the
Newton Mental Health clinic; the Faculty Committee on Student
‘Affairs’ recommendation for the elimination ot women’s hours;
lthe ad hoc committee’s suggestion for improving the mens’ resi-
\‘dence hall environment through room drawings for freshmen; and
[fir-ally, President Leggett’s position-and-progress report to the
‘Student Senate and his stated willingness to appear periodically
before that body will, when actualized, go far toward improving
ithe tenor of college life and, subsequently, that of its students.

—S. G.

The Case Against The P.E. Complex—

The administration admits to having "moved rapidly” on pre-
paring its proposal to get a federal grant for new physical education
facilities at Grinnell.

The elaborate plans for the RE. facilities were drawn up quick-
ly and quietly in a presidentially-appointed committee.

The announcement of the proposal came as a surprise to the
college community. Many students and iaculty did not ltnow how to
tvaluute the proposal.

No one seriously questions the need for better facilities at
Grinnell; the women’s gym being the outstanding ease in point. No
one questions the popularity of sports among some students at Grin~
men (70 per cent of the men students participate during any one
season). No one really even questions President Glenn Leggett's
contention that Grinnell students, usually immersed in study, prob-
ably don't get enough physical exercise.

The issue must be raised, however, whether the proposal is the
most sensible and economical way of meeting building needs

It is difﬁcult for a community to trust a decisron about its vital
concerns when it has been left so much in the dark. it is especially
diilicult when that decision appears so obviously extravagant.

President Leggett himself admitted that the new P.E. complex
is designed to be submerged below ground level so that it will not
appear out of proportion to the rest of the buildings on campus. But
one obviously cannot hide “33,463 gross square feet" of solid
masonry.

Now that it has been determined that the old Darby Gymna-
sium will probably continue to be used for recreation and physical
education, since other uses seem architecturally impractical, why
must new gym facilities be quite so extensive. For example, three
gyms are planned in the main rectangular structure (see ﬂoor
plans on next page). Wim the building of the new facilities there
will he a possible 6 basketball courts, 5 men's locker rooms, 10 ot-
fices, 3 “secretarial spaces,” and approximately 10 to 14 teaching
stations in the building (according to Mr. John Plitsch, Director of
Intercollegiate Athletics), These are all in addition to those facili-
ties already available in Darby.

The largest gym section in the proposed building will contain
facilities for basketball, volleyball, archery and badminton. It will
also have tennis courts, smooth falls for handball, and a “cage
suspended from the ceiling for use as a golf driving range.” But
another gym of almost comparable size in the building contains al-
most identical lacillties. Darby Gym could also be used in many
of the same ways.

Sauna baths and a swimming pool tour times as large as the
present one and with both olympic metric and standard American
lengths are also included.

Proponents of the proposal say that the new facilities are nec-
essary and swear to the fact that the new building does not indicate
an overemphasis on RE. The extra classrooms can be used by
other departments, they say, yet why are not these classrooms be-
ing built in, or near, nan,

Proponents also argue that the expenditure is not beyond
Grinnell’s means since the college may only be responSlble for 25
per cent of the 2 million. Yet there is a possibility that the school
may not receive the full grant. Future costs of upkeep must also be
considered.

As a college plans its total environment it must have in broad
vision to which it can continually refer. But is Grinnell planning for
the future with vision or is it acting piecemeal, haphazardly and he-
l‘iind closed doors?

How can the proper vision be created if vital student and fat;-
ulty concerns are represented only in closed and unknown com-
mittees. What kind of community is it that does not share decisionsr

The faculty is divided over the advisability of an elaborate RE.
complex. We would imagine that the faculty and students both have
doubts as to the emphasis this new building will assume over other
needs. None of the recent constructions on campus have been
valued so high financially. The RE. complex will cost $2 million
but the fine arts building (including Roberts Theater) cost $1,~
030,000; the library, $1,140,000; the Forum, $923,000.

The recent proposal could have been submitted for better

Rumblings . . . Student Revolt

By Dan Bucks

The sky fell again this week. Sleet and snow-
flakes spread across the Grinnell landscape.
Many of my fellow students greet such events
with joy. Despite the obstacles to human mobility
created by this white stuff, my friends get their
aesthetic ”kicks” from viewing the snowAladen
campus.

‘1, however, wish to dissent from any universal
declaration of joy over the falling of snow. True
enough, I ﬁnd the ﬂuffy white background a dis-
tinct improvement over Grinnell gray. But the
more the snow falls, the more ! long for sum-
mertime and for what I Wish to term the "Plea-
sures of the Plains."

It is my observation that those students who de-
light most in the snowfall are those whose aesthe-
tic sensitivities have been dulled by stark, cold,

and neonelit urban environments. They know not
ihe quiet joy to he experienced from planting a
kernel of corn, cultivating the tender green
plants, and watching the small sprouts grow to
heights of 10 to 12 feet. They know not the sense
of satisfaction (and power) from looking back on
the overturned tons of earth and saying, "I
plowed that furrow.” Hence, they do not share
the loneliness that agrarians feel in the winter.

Perhaps my plea for understanding will pm
voile, as a response from the campus, only a huge
yawn. My metropolitan contemporaries do not
share the spirit that rises from the soil. If Jef-
ferson's writings on the “noble farther" had been
included in the Historical Studies sequence, my
fellow students might have listened with greater
sympathy to agrarian rumblings. But alas, stu-
dents, given tbe present state f affairs, tail to
appreciate the virtues and qualities of this corn.

asking for better seminar rooms. The library is already over-
crowded with both students and books. Money should be reserved
for improving these conditions.

Expenditures for expansion of the faculty and for experimental
programs — both on campus and off — should have top priority.

President Leggett, we are sure, does have plans in the making
for meeting all the college’s building needs eventually. His ten year
fund drive assures further development. But hopetully the admin-
istration will not act alone in determining building policies in the
future.

in the meantime the college community as a whole can still
have a voice about the acceptance of the PE. proposal. If the pro—
posal is accepted by the government, but Grinnell does not act
upon it, the proposal will be withdrawn in a specified period of
time.
The entire community should evaluate the proposal. Should
Grinnell plan and build such extravagant P.E. facilities, or should
they be significantly modified.

Other building plans are in the making. it is up to the entire
community to evaluate what the tenor of life on the Grinnell cam-
pus should be now and in the future.

to he informed of and to understand as fully as

Ladies and gentlemen: I am
grateful to Mr. Faulwoll for
giving mo the opportunity to
speak to you, for I thought the
time had 00in when you would
like to hear from me directly
on matters that concern us all.
One of my purposes is a wish
to describe my attitude or posi-
tion on certain college prob-
lems which are of special con-
cern to you _ concerns such
asgwomen’s hours, open rooms,
in.general what we might call
the elements of student civili-
zafion. Another purpose is to
give you a progress report on
collage matters which are now
in preparation or conversation
at stages —— matters such as
building projects, curriculum
changes, and long-range goals
in general. The nice separation
between college plans and col-
lege problems is of Course arti-
ficial. The truth is that now
and tomorrow, you and I and
a number of other people are
involved in both matters to»
gether, and, ideally, our
rhetoric as well as our actions
ought to reflect the inseparable
feet.

Just: before Christmas vaca-
tion I addressed the faculty on
the state of the College, com-
menting on what 1 thought
were four major areas of con-
earn in a private, residential,
liberal arts college: (i) the
problem of increasing its fi-
nancial support; (2) the prob-
lem of improving the profes
sional life of its faculty; (3)

'the problem of relating our
commitment to general educa-
tion with the demands of pre
professional training; (4) tho
problem of maintaining and im-
proving the specinl educational
virtues of living in a residen-
tial college, Though I expect:

to touch at least indirectly on
all those matters tonight, I
want to begin with the ques»
tion of our residenceliall civil.
ization. and I think it would be
appropriate if 1 said to you
what 1 said to the faculty, and
then later, through the Alum-
ni 5&3, to alumni and parents.
You will agree at least with
the first sentence.

The events of the past oath
ple of weeks have been hard
on all of us, and it has been
difficult at times to keep our
humanity and humor ringing
clear . . .

The chief issue is whether
the college as an institution
has a right to judge whether
the ont-af-cllss behavior of
students is appropriate or in»
eppropriate to the education-
al mission the college sets
for itself. 1 think the college
does, and I am aware that it
is the president of the col-
lege who has to execute the
judgment . . .

1 am also aware that the
judgment should neflect an
institutional responsibility,
“that something it stands
for," which adheres to a col-
lege having a history and a
living purpose and as such
belongs not only to present
day students and faculty
but to generations of pre
vious students and faculty

\members.

Drlwlnﬂ of P. I, plan: by carol McConoohie

Representatives of this group met with
President Leggett Thursday to present and
discuss the following letter and its implica-
tions. The group will meet with Leggeti with-
in the next week and specific answers are
expected by the week’s end.

Dear President Leggett,

In order for there to be any chance of a mean-
ingful dialogue on the problems with which the
Griifnell community is presently faced, we feel
that the student body must be fully and frankly
informed on a number of specific areas of Con-
cern. We call on you to publicly answer, by
means of a published statement in the 5&3 or
address before the Senate, the following ques—
tions. It is extremely important that these ques-
tions be specifically and directly dealt with, and,
if there exists a sincere wish to discuss their
implications, there be a reply in the near future.

Our questions reflect a lack of student infor-
mation on campus issues which vitally affect us
and about which we feel we have a right to be
informed. We ask that you bridge the existing in-
formation gap which is causing students to ques-
tion the aims and motives of those who deter-
mine the direction of Grinnell life.

It, as you insist, this college is a community, it
follows that those who dwell in it have the right

possible the policies which govern the concern.
We present to you in this letter specific questions
covering Six major areas of student concern. We
ask that you reply to the following:

1. Question: What accounts for the extraordin-
orily large size of classes this semester? What
concrete plans are being made to remedy this
situation?

Comment: We deplore the existence of largo
classes which decrease the effectiveness of tin
struction by limiting instructional techniques to
lecture. thereby inhibiting open class discussion
that small classes encourage. We deliberately
chose to attend a small liberal arts college pro.
cisely to avoid the disadvantage of large, im-
personal classes.

2. Question: In your speech on Wednesday, and
in the report of the Faculty Committee on sm-
dent Affairs, the abolition of women's hours was
consistently related to the “problem” of open
dorms. How do you see the relationship between
these two issues?

Comment: There seems implicit in your state-
ment at philosophhy relating the women's hours
proposal to the issue of open dorms. Moreover,
there seems to be an explicit condition that any
change in women’s hours is contingent upon you!

Book Review — Part It

A Sociological Look at Sex

By Melinda Ward

Ira L. keiss, in Premarital Sexual Attitudes
in America, divides America's standards into four
major categories — the double standard, permis-
siveness without affection, permissiveness with
affection, and a single standard of abstinence.

Reiss deals with each standard separately and
outlines each at their negativesvalue consequences
(pregnancy, venereal disease, guilt) and positive-
value consequences (physical and psychic sati
faction, aid to marital adjustment).

The double standard “entails using one stand-
8rd to evaluate male behavior and another stand-
and to evaluate female behavior, making it pos<
sible for a man and a woman to be judged quite
differently on the identical sort of behavior."
According to Reiss, it is our dominant informal
sexual standard. He also found that many men
approving the double standard often held absti-
nence as their ideal standard. Reiss maintains
that the double standard consists of two types;
the orthodox (premarital sexual freedom for
men and abstinence for Women) and the iranSi-
tiorlal (leeway is given to the Woman who is one
gaged or “in love”). Reiss feels that this stand-
ard gives rise to more conflicts and contradic-
tions than any other standard.

“it is evident that the feminist movement
with its platform of equality, greatly week-
ened the double standard. Furthermore, the
development of contraception meant that the
fear of illegitimate offspring and venereal
disease was no longer applicable as a support
for female virginity. Romantic Love also he
voted, in its later stages, on equalifarlan atti-
tude towards women. Women were in be loved
psychlcolly as well as physically. Love nnd
sex could be joined according to the later
knmanticists; this was opposed to the double
standard. Finally, the Industrial Revolution
and urbanism gave women greater opportu-
nities to exercise their new found rights with-
out the restrictions of small town gossip and
social controls." Nevertheless, the double
standard seems most popular, especially in
the lower classes, and conflicts with the cul-
tural changes cited above.

Another contradictory and negative aspect of
his Standard is the labeling of “good" and “bad"
women (after all it is the “bad” women who
make this standard possible). Sexual adjustment
in marriage may be more difficult for the ad-
herents of this standard, say! Reiss, because
the male's learned behavior will tend to be body-
centered rather than personcentered. A certain

amount of guilt may also be associated with tho
male's sexual behavior because before marriage,
his partner had always been an unrespected
"bad" girl.

Permissiveness with affection is just a step
beyond the transitional double standard. This il
a single standard in that “it accepts coitus as
right for both men and women when a stable
affectionate relationship is involved. This Stamf-
ard implies personcenfered behavior, rather
than bodyrcentered, since strong affection or love
is a prerequisite to sexual intercourse. The affeov
fion involved also tends to make the person:
cautious about pregnancy and venereal disease.

Because of the growing popularity of this pen
missive standard and the accent on affection, the
guilt in this case is not associated with sex or
with a relationship in which sex is an integral
part. (Permissiveness with affection is not to be
confused with trial marriage.) Reiss notes, “Peoi
pie who accept permissiveness with affection do
not usually intend their behavior to be a trio]
marriage—in many cases, the people concerned
are not definitely interested in marriage. Sexual
intercourse is viewed as an expression of their
feelings for each other and not usually as a test
of their compatibility." There does seem reason
to believe, Reiss comments, that a person adher-
inging to this standard will have an easier, mot!
satisfactory sexual adjustment in marriage,

A third current sexual standard is permissivo<
ness without affection which consists, Reiss says,
of two main kinds: there is the orglastic, “those
who seek highly promiscuous coitus with precau.
tionary measures of secondary importance,” and
the sophisticated, “those who seek physical pleas
ure in a more controlled and careful way.” The
latter type seems to be more prevalent as u Sits
ciolcgical factor and the former more often than
not should be reserved for psychological study.
This standard flies against many of our Convic<
lions, religious beliefs being the oldest. As Reiss
explains, it emphasizes body-centered coitus and
most often does not lead to marriage, However,
it is a single standard and it. keeps one from
thinking his sexual partner is “bad”.

The last category that Reiss discusses is absti-
nence. Even this standard has undergone a
change in the last century. A Swedish student
interviewed by Reiss noted that although Ameri-
can women abstain from intercourse, they will
engage in all sorts of sexual behavror up to that
point. Although this behavior prevents pregnancy
and the spread of venereal disease, it also leads
to frustration and psychological problems, we
cording to Reiss,

in our stance toward the
civilization of our students we
cannot escape standing for
something, even if that some-
thing may turn out to lie
nothing. But we can take
some comfort in the fact that
on the problems of student
culture we are in the fore-
front, and that only first-
rate institutions appear to
share it with us. it speaks
to the essential quality of
our students and the faculty
that attracts them . . .

In this environment we
cannot say, as some academi-
cians do, that free experience
is a valuable educative pro-
cess and then lock ourselves
in our private studies.

Nor can we say, as some
outsiders do, that tougher
rules and stricter enforce-
ment will “straighten the lita
tle rascals out," to use the es.
pence of their words.

We live in an environment
that our attitude helps to
make, and its results are vie

New Environment

Effective ways of improving
the environment involve a
number of things. One neceSc
sity is to improve our inherited
physical structure — by reno-
vations, by new buildings. by
new arrangements. Another
necessity is to discuss and re-
fine or even change our pres-
ent rule structure against the
background of a rational and
philosophic position — a pro-
cess that cannot be accom-
plished overnight but must be
gin immediately if we are to
get ourselves out of this series
of constant emergencies and

confrontations. Still another is-

for all of us to admit that the
decision-making in any aca-
demic community will always
be a somewhat painful one for
all of us, but particularly so in
an institution like this one
where we cherish not a ma-
chine-like efficiency but the ed-
ucational virtues (and delays)
of discussion, consultation, con-
sensus, and process.

Let me speak more specifi-
cally, in late November of last
year, your Senators presented

SCARLET AND BLACK

 

a proposal on “women’s hours”
to the Facility Conuliittee on
Student Affairs. Within the
period of 30 academic days al-
loted to it, this committee has
reviewed the proposal, suggest-
ed certain changes, and for-
warded it to me. The conclud~
ing recommendation of the
committee is as follows:

The Committee is recom-
mending m the President of
the College that the College,
contingent on workable solu-
tions to the problems out-
lined above, require no he
deuce hall “hours" for wom-
en students. Because the
Committee feels some confi-
dence that the problems can
be met, or at least that rea-
sonable answers to the prob-
lems will be in sight by the
end of the second semester
of the 1966-67 academic year,
it proposes September of
1967 as the earliest realiza-
tion of the elimination of
women’s hours.

Submit to Trustee!

According to the Procedural
Regulations in the student
Handbook, 1 have all days in
which to make a recommenda-
tion about the proposal to the
Board of Trustees, which shall
take final action at its next
regularly scheduled meeting,
provided that notice of the pro.
gosed modification is received

y its members at least so
days prior to that meeting.

The aorday notification re-
quirement means that formal
action by the trustees on the
proposal will not be possible
until the spring meeting, which
is scheduled for late May. But
the trustees will be here this
weekend and i expect to dis-
cuss the proposal with them
and arrive at some informal de-
terminations. In keeping with a
practice 1 established last fall,
I shall ask several students (to
be recommended to me by Mr.
Kent) to lunch privately with
the trustees, ,the discussion
topic to be determined by the
students. i assume Mr, Kent
will nominate his most per-
suasive classmates and that the
matter of women’s hours will
be central to the discussion. In
the meantime, i expect to dis-
cuss the proposal with mem-
bers of the Faculty Executive
Council, to send copies to in-
dividual faculty members for
their comment, and to deter-
mine what recommendation
about the proposal i shall pre-
scnt to the trustees. Quite
frankly, my recommendation to

the trustees will be influenced
by what I hear from the E»
ecutive Council of the Faculty,
from the faculty at large, from
the deans and the members of
the Committee on Student Af<
fairs, and of course from stu-
dents themselves. The ami-
ability and constructive lia-
turc of the discussion will also
have their effect. At the ino-
ment, 1 have concerns about
some aspects of the proposal-
its range, its implementation,
and its implications for our
whole social structure, but at
the minimum, i expect to take
an affirmative attitude on the
matter of some liberalization
in women’s hours with the
trustees this weekend.

Workable System

In its proposal to me, the
Faculty Committee on student
Affairs speaks at some length
about the firm expectations
and conditions which the col-
lege believes to be prerequisites
to a successful realization of a
workable system of unrestrict-
ed hours for women. The pro-
posal remarks about privacy.
overcrowding, the need for
more recreation and lounge
space. It also remarks about
the need for a \velirunderstood
agreement on the role of resi-
dent advisers, house presidents
and house councils and how
they relate to one another in
the process of improving and
maintaining residence hall life
and dealing with the disruption
of it. The proposal also exA
presses a concern about the un-
resolved "open rooms" ques-
tion, saying as follows:

Perhaps most closely re
lated to the practical aspects
of thc elimination of wom-
en’s hours are the still un-
resolved differences of opin-
ion on coeducational use of
dormitory rooms. Only with
a careful review of our pres-
ent "open dorms" policy can
we hope to dispel the existing

atmosphere of contention
and distrust, and the Com-
mittee expects to have a full
discussion and rcview of the
entire "open dorms" question

and to make definite rec-
ommendations by the end of
this semester.

"Open Dorms" Question

Now, a full discussion of the
entire “open dorms" question
ought not to take place in an
adverse climate in which
either-or confrontations dic-
tale the strategy. This uneasy
climate is likely to continue
until we deal with the center of
it, not just the edges. It seems
to me that at the center are
some large, unresolved prob-
lems about fundamental college
positions _ specifically on sex
ual behavior, or drinking, or
the range and limits of student
government. As you will dia-
cover when you see the pro-
posal, this concern about ir-
resolutions on major issues is
reflected by the Faculty Com-
mittee on Student Affairs in
dealing with the matter of
women's hours, which in itself
seems the relatively simple
matter of recognizing that
women are as responsible as
men about the apportionment
of their time. In this instance,
the concern of the committee
does not prevent its recom.

mendation that, given certain
Conditions, the proposal of
women’s hours is workable.
But on the matter of “open
rooms,” the workability of any
proposal depends not simply
on the responsibility of indi-
vidual students but on (2
Whole milieu of student civili-
zation.

"Position" Papers

Accordingly, I wish you to
begin now to work out a sys-
tem of consultation with your-
selves, with representative fac—
ulty, and with the deans so
that we can develop what we
might call “position” papers on
the proper and realistic stance
of the College on the questions
of sexual behavior, on drink-
ing, and on student govern-
ment. We have the drug state»
ment of last year to provide us
with something of a model, Po-
sition papers, as I choose to
call them. do not of course
eliminate all problems; the hu-
man condition cannct be cir-
cumscribed by print, But posi-
tion papers. if they are honest
and dignified, can give all of
us the security of knowing
where individual rights end
and college concerns begin. 1
think we ought to begin this
process of consultation and
writing at once. i am not going
to ask the deans to call you to-
gether and provide the im<
petus. You have a consulta-
tive process of your own and i
am going to ask you to involve
the deans and faculty in it.
What comes out finally must
be the position of the College,
not just the point of view of
separate constituencies, Until
this is accomplished, i am per-
suaded that the matter of
"open rooms" should be kept
at the status quo; that is. open
houses Sunday afternoons, and
in connection with a limited
number of lounge and house
parties.

Pledge of Faith

I ask for your cooperation
and good faith on this matter,
and l pledge you mine. If you
will invite me, i would like to
return every two or three
weeks with comments and prog-
ress reports and listen, in
turn, to yours. 1 have no de-
sire to fasten an authoritative
code of behavior on the Col-
lege. I desire only that our ac-
tions reflect the moral values
the College believes inherent
in the study of the liberal arts.
These values are many, and in-
terpretations and definition of
them will vary, but those most
pertinent to this discussion are
selflessness, social responsibili»
ty, a preference for excellence
and quality in ideas. people
and actions and, much more
generally. the strength of char-
acter necessary to resist per-
sonal conduct which is destruc-
tive of any of the ideas which
study in the arts and sciences
demonstrate to be good. I re-
fer here to such things as hon-
esty (both public and private),
compassion, reverence for
life, an awareness of the gen.
eral advantages of order over
chaos and so on. There is not a
course of study in the College,
nor is there an extracurricular
activity, which does not try, in
some way or other, to demon-
strate the normative value of
these things and things like
them.

In saying this I don’t mean
to ignore or excuse the fact
that these values are some-

Indian Intonation

By Jane Geffken
anti
Bobbie Welser

South lndian Classical music,
as exemplified by Friday
night’s concert, Is like a psy-
chedelic experience without
psychedelics. It is hard to de»
scribe the essence of the
music: kaleidoscopic a p h r o
dislac? liberating? inebriating’i’
Truly, it had to be heard to
be described. However. the
group’s MC, Dr. Robert Brown,
ethnomusicologist at Wesleyan
University. did answer some
general questions about the
background of the music and
the training of the musicians.

South Indian classical music
ls essentially religious in char
acter. In India, the sacred is
not separate (tom the secular;
rather, both are part of a
religious sensibility which is a
way or llie. The text at indian
music is devotional, and some
Sanscrit texts originated with
the Vedas in 3000 EC. How-
ever the musical form I5 con-
stantly developing, and some
compositions are quite recent.

An Indian child. it chosen by
his parents to become a musi-
cian, begins studying at the
age at rive or six when he
goes to live with his teacher. .
It is the parents' responsibility
to select a good instructor; if
the Child fails. the parents
are blamed. The teacher sup-
ports the child, and the child
periorms menial labors in ad-
dition to his intensive study.

Females may also be chosen
for the profession; many he-
come singers or vena players.

Although there is no discern-
lble correlation between West-
em and Indian solieggio, (syl-
lahles applied to scale degrees),
it is possible that our western
solieggio was derived from the
lndian system. As Dr. Brown
explained, the Greeks claim
that their music comes from
India. Since we have derived
many oi our iundamentals or
music from Greek modes and
notation, it Is possible that our
system is in some way derived
trom lndian origins.

One of the components of the
ensemble consists of the tame
bore, or drone, which provides
a continuum ot underlying
tones; a relerenoe point, or, in
Dr. Brown's Words, "the cash
vas on which the picture is
painted." The other components
are the drum, which is largely
improvisational, the violin, and
the voice.

The revolutionary method is

Furthermore, Don’s “slap-
happy“ attitude toward last

sents the attitudo of a good
number of students on this
campus. That is, a lot of stu-
dents do not havo a serious at-
titude toward not only the i
sues or college policy and visi—
tation but also campus life in
general.

Doubting the honesty of the
revolutionaries rather than the

flaw in our attitude and also to
a basic strength in Roger's
revolutionary movement: the
determination that we lack.
Most of us on campus do not

“Grinnell As If Is"

To the Editor:

The general debate over tho
aims of campus lifc has become

stymied by two obstacles: ad.
ministrative caprico and our
own failure as students to clari-
fy our values and objectives.
We are therefore impelled to
examine our failure as a socio-
ty, the promises which remain
to be fulfilled, and the means
of their attainment. 1n facing
these problems with outspoken
clarity, we shall be better able
to press forward with the goals
of last fall's Encampment
First. North Campus is a
spurious community. We have
passively allowed a noisy but
insecure minority to impose
standards of abuse, banality,
and disrespect as the norms of
hall life — to subvert the very
notion of personality. To bols-
ter their sell-confidence and
remove status anxieties, many
students form tribal loyalties,
symbolized by Inrlokes, man.

and the scrupulous exclusion of

be “one hell of a man.” The
result is abdication of manli~
ness, the formation of a herd,
Where fellowship invites
variety, the pack appeals to the
least common denominator: the
cheap, the vulgar, and the ob-
scene. As in other primitive cul-
tures, the iolkways are enforced

News From Other Campuses

Kent in Vief Protest

(ACP) — Realizing that pub-
lic ridicule and a cold shoulder
from the Johnson administra-
lion have stifled the anti—Viet-
nam war movement, several
student leaders decided, last
summer, to adopt a soft-sell
approach.

The students decided to dis-
courage demonstration tactics
but rejuvenate the movement
by 1) mobilizing “moderate"
students who oppose the United
States policies in Vietnam but
who shy away from radical
tactics; 2) stimulating discus-
sion about the war; 3) dis-
pelling the notion that people
opposing the war are merely
unkempt heatnick radicals and
4) gaining the ear of the ad-
ministration by thoughtful pre-
sentation of the issues.

The first step in the new
approach was an open letter
to President Johnson. Student
leaders across the nation, in-

chlding Grinnell Student Gov-
ernment Association President,
Steve Kent, wrote President
Johnson that increasing num-
bers of students are deeply
troubled about the war and
urged him to clarify American
objectives in order to ease
doubts abouu U. s, policy.

Vietnamese Protest

Foreign Sshoois

(ACF) — South Vietnamese
students are protesting the ex~
istence of foreign schools in
South Vietnam. Saigon students
have formed the Committee
for the Use of Vietnamese at
University Level and Against
Foreign Schools in Vietnam to
close schools teaching in for-
eign la n g u a g e 5, especially
French. At a seminar held re-
cently in Saigon, a spokesman
said, “it is absurd that the
government does not control
the presence of foreign
cultures."

Credit For Work
Proposed of U. C. L A.

The U.C.L.A. “Dally Bruin”
has proposed a program pro
viding academic credit for field
work. The basis for granting
credit would be a realistic plan
for community service sponsorr
ed by a faculty member and
taken on a passrfail basis. Ex-
amination would be by oral dis-
cussion with the sponsoring pro-
fessor, supported by a short pa-
per. Credit would depend on the
amount of time and involvement
in the program ranging from
one-half course to one and one-
half courses for any given quar-
ler.

Projects it considerable dis-
tance from the campus could be
pursued during vacation periods.
The student would petition his
faculty sponsor for credit during
the quarter following his vaca-
tion project.

interpretation of the effectiveness of student rule
enforcement.

3. Question: Why was SGA granted less than
half its request for an activities fee increase?
(in what basis was this decision made, and what
financial priorities does it reflect?

Comment: The small increase in the activities
fee will seriously hamper such SEA-sponsored our
tivities as Nous, the radio station, and the number
of formal dances. It also prevents the creation of
a proposed student-financed speaker’s bureau. The
paucity of the increase ignores l) a tremendous
increase in entertainment costs 2) the fact that
our isolated environment necessitates an exclus-
ively college-based program of activities which is
dependent on adequate allotment for purchased
entertainment.

4. Question: How does the college justify aca-
demic punishment for social offenses?

Comment: The college’s continued dependence
upon separation as a punitive measure against the
individual cannot substitute for sanctions applied
within the college environment. Extreme punish-
ments intended to function as examples do not
serve a constructive purpose. The college system
of rules and punishment must realistically reflect
the community interest.

5. Questio Why does the college not consider
offrcampus living for men and women a legiti-
mate part of the resident system?

Comments: “Residential living” should not re—
strict the individual to four years of dormitory

life, The dormitory system can have values in
teaching the individual to live in a communal sit-
uation, However an institution like Grinncll must
accommodate individual differences and needs
in the determination of a living situation.

5. Question: To What extent and in what situa-
tions will the new resident advisors be responsi-
ble to the administration? Precisely what func-
tions will they assume from the hall presidents?

Comment: A statement is required of the ad-
minlstration‘s policy concerning the responsibil—
ities of the resrdent advisors. Student confidence
in the advisors can only be maintained by a
guarantee that discussions between a student and
an advisor remain striCtJy confidential, and fur-
ther, that consultation with the dean's office only
be taken with the consent of the student in-
volved.

Any duties assumed by the resident advisor
from the hall president must not jeopardize the
sovereignty of student rule enforcement.

7. Question: Finally, why is a letter such as this
necessary? Doesn’t the maintenance of a Grin-
nell College community necessitate communica-
tion between the administration and students on
vital issues?

Fulbright": Book
is PPPE Choice

Tile PPPE Political Book-Of-
the Month selection for Felr
wary-March, The Arrogance of
Power by Senator J. William
Fulbright, illustrates what one
reviewer has called “the alien-
ation of a great many thought-
ful citizens from their govem-
merit."

Fulbright, chairman of the
powerful Foreign Relatiom
committee of the U, S. Senate,
has long been a serious critic
of the Johnson administratioh
and its foreign policy. But in
this book, he goes beyond mere
criticism of U. S. policy in
Vietnam, the Dominican Re-
public or Cuba. He indicts the
American people for a collecta
ive arrogance, infecting both
our attitudes and our actions
with “an exaggerated sense of
power and an imaginary sense
of mission” that distorts not
only our national policies but
our national character as well.

The “arrogance of ower,"
says Fulbright, ls rel .ted in
the smug manners of the Arn-
erican tourist or the U.S. com
sultant to lnreign governments,
in the all too typical American
attitude of superiority to the
“underdeveloped” areas of the
world, and in an unwillingness
to understand and accept on
the part of young, emerging
nations the same revolution.

ism that accompanied the birth

North Campus Lite May Change;
"Quota" Room Drawing Considered

By Richard Schneirov

Modification of room assign-
ment procedure in the men's
residence hall system, recom-
mended by an ad hoc student-
iaculty committee on problems
in the hall system, was ap-
proved by President Leggett
this month, The change is now
being considered by the Execu-
tive Cabinet and the CoiHP,

The approved proposal calls
for a room drawing system for
male freshmen similar to that
now in use {or women. At the
close oi their first year, fresh-
men would participate in s
North Campus room drawing.

Numerically d e te rm i ned
choices would be limited by
eunsiderations of class balance,
Juniors and sophomores would
continue to choose rooms under
the existing framework

In its report in President
Leggett the ad hoc commits
tee stated, “The proposal pro-
vides for balancing classes
. . .. provides the men with
sophomore and Junior standing
free mobility within the halls,
hroadens opportunities for
close friendships in the first
two years, gives incentive to
p upperclassman-ireshman rela-
_ tionshlps, weakens the incen-
tives behind “prepping," pro-
vides the Dean of Men with
more practical means than he
now has to make changes in

room assignments which may
be necessary for the good at
individuals or halls, and will
have an effect upon the
closed-society aspects of some
of the men’s halls without de-
stroying their traditional in-
tegration and self-governing
independence."

Tentative date {or putting the
proposal into effect is 1968, ac-
cording to present plans. Thus,
the ﬁrst students who would
participate in room drawings
would be next semester’s in-
coming freshmen, The Execu-
tive Cabinet is now discussing
this room selection proposal with
the Deans’ Committee.

Proponents of the new system
admit that certain problems
may arise from it. A major
concern is the conﬂict in some
cases between individual mobil-
ity and class balance.

A conflict in scheduling may
occur because room drawings
take place shortly before the
end of the semester and the
college continues to make its
placement decisions well into
the summer. Another problem
concerns the possibility that u
narrow individual hall charac-
ter might emerge from a sys-
tem that would allow freshmen
to choose for themselves. Final-
ly, a class imbalance might
result from exempting sopho~
mores and juniors from quotasl

dividualism is constricting _ it
reduces others to objects, de-
nying the mutual regard which
is the basis of freedom. We
must restore a viable social
framework for personal expres»
sion.

cur seal-eh for community
leads us to the question of
Griilllell’s institutional integ-
rity, The President, the Deans,
and the members of the FCSA
are all qualified and dedicated
people; we do not question their
motives as individuals. But the
sum total of their collective de-
cisicns appear inconsistent, un-
alierable, and innnical to per»
sonal privacy,

If this interpretation is valid,
we must ask whether there is
hypocrisy within the structure
itself.

As s case in point, last De-
cember‘s suspensions reveal a
major distortion of moral is-
sues. All of us, in our myriad
personal relationships, are con
strained to one pattern of sex~
ual conduct: force makes right.
And the cost of ditference is
ruinous. Suspension does not
mean a simple change of resi-
dence or transfer at credits, but
the abrupt interruption of
friendships. It is exile — ex.
pulsion from home.

This instance is even more
pertinent when one recalls that
the Deans were informed about
the violation in order to assist
an ill student. When counseling
is made u method of rule en-
forcement, trust breaks down
and the genuine problems of
college life remain unresolved
Such irrelevance is demon-
sti-oted in diverse ways. For- ex-
ample; how have present re
strictions on open rooms and
drinking helped to break the
herd mentality on North Cam-
pusi

While the Hobbesian philos-
ophy of Burling Basement is
clearly a negative social iorce,
it also compromises the intellec-
tual pursuits of the liberal arts
college. Indeed, I believe this
aspect demands not only stu-
dent revolt, but faculty revolt.
The censorship of Ionesco’s
The Chairs, ordered through
fear of unfavorable alumni re
action, is the culmination of
many subtler administrative at.
tempts to regulate artistic ex-
pression Tile loss for our thea-
ter hns been evident to nil.

Thus we have seen that the
existing structure provides ar-
liitrary restraints, but fails to
solve corporate stress. Rather,

it intensiﬁes them by alienating
students from a system which
we did not design. The unfor-
tunate consequence is that
many or us live outside all sys‘
talus, dwelling in isolation or
joining the irresponsible aggro
gation of the tribe.

If their development is

tutional hypocrisy, the soul of
the scholarly fraternity must

these imperatives which have

Steve Kent's progressive admin-

like to propose some broad
ideas for the meaningful reali-
zatiolt of the S,G.A. programs.

The overriding goal of educa-
tion is the achievement of on
integrated life; one where in
tellectuel, social, and sexual
identity may be expressed
through respectful cooperation.
The framework for such n com-
munity must rest in a positive
student tradition, and cannot
be imposed by external authori-
ty. Therefore, we can reverse
the pattern of prolonged ado»
lesceuce only by a radical de-
termination to constructively
regulate ourselves. To imple-
ment this intention, student
government must be granted an

autonomy corresponding to that @——r 7 '

of the faculty. Given n free
hand and a responsible man-
date, capable leadership should
succeed in forming a new con-
sensus; one which will work to
improve the tone of social life.

Numerous practical steps
might be taken. he creation of
alternate men’s and women’s
halls and the practice of com-
mon dining would do much to
alleviate the barracks atmos~
