Student Counseling Available:
Broader Foriliiios Needed

By KRYS NEUMAN

Concern about the lack of ade-
quate counseling services at
Grinnell has prompted work
“toward the goal of a iull»time
counseling office." says Asso-
nlate Dealt Richard Winters.

At present, the college makes
available the proiessioual psy-
chological and psychiatric serv-
ices of the Jasper County Men<
tal Health Clinic at Newton, 17
miles aivay.

Winters feels that the New-
ton clinic has a “dedicated
team of Workers" and that
crlnnell is “fortunate to have
such a complete set-up nearby."
Although an inirequent bus
schedule makes a Newton trip
inconvenient, Winters says stu-
dents can easily get rides with
friends; housemothers and even
the deans themselves have
driven students in the past. Win-
ters believes the arrangement
is really much less complicated

than that involved in seeing a
psychiatrist in a large city

According to contract, the
college covers the cost of the
first three to five visits to New-
ton, although a student may
elect to seek help there inde-
pendent oi the college arrange-
ment.

Dean Winters reports that the
majority of student cases han<
dled at the clinic involve “acute
moments of anxiety" and are
resolved in five or six visits.

More serious cases, however,
require the student to assume
the continuing financial burden
and thereby sometimes necessi~
tate dropping out of school,
Some students have sought
therapy at the IowatCity Psy-
chopathic Outpatient Clinic, al-
though the College has no sup-
portive iinancial arrangement
there.

Jones: ‘Coﬂeellouse Mood‘ Prevails
University Oiiers Casual Intellectual, Social Life

“A casual coilecllouse mood," best describes
the atmosphere of the University of Sussex, ac
cording to Alan Jones, history. Housed in “a wing
of a secluded country manor," Jones spent last
year teaching and writing at the new English

university.

At Sussex, chartered in August 1961, Jones
taught a seminar on class in contemporary
America and supervised tutorials in American
history. Located near the “swinging” seacoast
resort of Brighton, the threeayeai', non-residen-
tial university, comments Jones, “attracts many
students who regard undergraduate education
as an end in itself," Hence, he remarks, Student
Intellectual and Social life is casual, not “die-

tated by proiessional ideas."

The nine new English universities, created in
response to the swelling student popularlon, have
been planned as a whole. and special attention
has been paid to their sites and archltecture.
“They’ve really caught on,” says Jones, “25 Slu‘

dents apply tor every one accepted,”

Jones noted that “Sussex students take the
initiative in managing their own education," an
opinion supported by the existence oi some so in.
dependent student intellectual Societies. Student
publications run the gamut from Sll'en (poetry)

there. But, hopefully, and only hopefully, more will

opefully, this encampment will serve as the germinal

event it was meant to her

In order for such a happy turn of events to occur, a
genuine effort must be made by the participants in the
encampment to arrive at some concrete, printable ideas,
ideas which can serve as a jumping off point in the
struggle to define the “Grinnell Idea."

These ideas must be more than just a few dry pages
of post office throwaway. A way must be found to pre-
serve the vitality of the encampment experience and
bring it back home to the “troops.”

lf this way is not found, encampment will remain the
irrelevant activity it has so far been — irrelevant in the
sense that the 1140 students and 100 faculty who aren’t
there never benefit froin it—irrelevant in the sense that it
smacks of the “splendid rhetoric” about which President

Leggett has warned us.

And when the task of making encampment relevant
begins to bog down amidst the apparent apathy of those
who stay home, we cannot throw up our hands and cry
defeat. The battle must be pressed or the Grinnell Idea
Isn’t worth the trouble and expense of going to Boone in

S&B Goals

To the Editor: The live or us
who prepared last week’s article
on our LeMoyne experience
would like to clarify some edi<
tonal errors and protest the
manner in which the Sari!
Sta.“ handled the article.

We realize that newspaper
articles seldom appear in print
exactly as written because the
mechanics ol journalism re-
quire some cutting and reword-
ing, But no editor should a)
insert things not included by the
authors, b) carelessly change
"wording” in such a way as to
render the author’s statements
incorrect or insulting. and c)
sublieadline the article With a
halfrtruth which will be seen
by many people who do not
read the entire article.

Although there are other er-
rors or lesser importance we
would like to straighten our two
in particular, for the beneﬁt
of Grinnell r e a d e r s and
iriends who may read the ar-
ticle. First, the exchange
teacher in the picture was from
the university or lowa, not
Southern Illinois University.
Second, the word “squalor" in
column two was definitely not
included in the original article

It “squalor" was observed
by membels of the SH? staff,
who we realize have also par»
ticipated in the LeMoyne pro-
gram, this and any other ob-

servation should be presented
in another article under their
own names—J. Poland, A. Rosr

Proiect Penelrates

To the Editor: In an age dom-
lnated by electrically Operated
devices, it seems only natural
that contemporary artistic cul-
ture should also experience
some degree of electrification.
Electric motors and lights have
unquestionably added the di-
mension of temporality to ma-
dcrn painting and sculpture.
Music, too, has thrived on elec-
tricity. Not only have radios and
phonographs inadc music gcn»
erally available, but musicians
have successfully employed
amplifiers and tape recorders lo
produce sounds, the likes of
which could never be made
without electrical assistance.

Milton Babbitt of Princeton
University has expressed the no-
tion that electronic music has
extended the bounds of music
writing. Whereas in the past,
composers were limited by the
physical capabilities of the per
farmers, the limits of electronic
music lie in the ability of the
human ear to pErceive.

At their recent concert in
Darby Gymnasium a group of
gay young men known as the
Blues project demonstrated that
Professor Babbitt had not been
entirely accurate, The sounds
produced electrically by this
group bypassed the listener's
our and penetrlted the Very
bowels of the man. whereupon
they turned his stomach. — D.

Tip Your Waitress?

Much as I hate to admit it,
the power or the press — at
least on the Grinnell campus -
is conﬁned to critical sugges-
tions. And irom there it is
generally up to the student
body of readers to take action
of one kind or another.

The 5&3 has in the past
proliererl a host at sugges-
tions for various improve-
ments on campus but all too
often what takes place is an
uniortunaie syndrome some-
thing like this: When editor-
ials are of a critical, some-
times even sarcastic nature,
we are applauded. “Did you
mad what the paper said a-
bout Saga? The 58.3 really
ripped it apart."

“Yeah,” says your friend,
“and I really do think Saga
workers should get more mon-
ey'n

But when criticism is of a
positive kind, interest all but
expires before the altar of ap-

Ed. mm The following
essay is the first installment
of what is hoped to be a cori-
linuing series in the 5&3. The
5&8 welcomes responsible ex-
pressions of opinion from
members at the student body
in the form of short (400-501)
words) essays of this type.
Subject matter is unimportant
as long as the subject is
somehow relevant to Student
life. Any student wishing to
submit such an essay should
ﬁrst query the editor of the
5&3.

Perhaps one or the most
tragic outcomes of Mr. John-
son’s consensus — ridden “Great
Society” is the nearly total ab-
sence of serious discussion on
the ’66 Election‘s most crucial
issue —— the war in Viet Nam.
With only a low exceptions _-
Hatfield in Oregon being the
most outstanding — the Viet
Nam issue has been silenced
in electoral compaiyls throng
out the country. it there is i
deed is substantial portion of
the electorate opposed to our
Vietnamese policy, it appears
that it will have little chance
to express itself in November.

The candidacy of Urban-
thlc High School science
teacher Charles Day for the
[1.5. Senate is one 0! the few
exception to an otherwise
gloomy political picture. Mr.
Day is winning squarely on
a peace ticket, and his pre-
sence in the election gives
Iowa voters, at least, a real
opportunity to express lhem-
selves on Viet Nam. Unfor-
tunately, Mr. Day‘s pros-
pects tor subsmntiai success
are about as depl'essin" as
the political context in which
he finds hinis’elfr Mr. Day
himself freely admits tl "t his
chances- or being ciccm c
ahout one hundred to one.”
ll this amblllous electoral ei-

athetic languor. This time I
have some constructive criti<
cism, and I’m hoping you will
take the appropriate positive ac-
tion.

Each of your Saga wait.
resses and busboys has no
wait on an average of live
tables at sitdown dinner, and
oven so the service -— if
nothing else — is usually
pretty liiir. And tor their
trouble or veritably whizziiig
back and forth between five
tabla, these hardy souls are
-— as previously noted — paid
the fantastic sum of eighty«
eight cents.

Two Ihings are obvious about
this situation. The ﬁrst, point<
ed out in our September 16
issue, is that it is insuiierahle.
The second, obvious to all who
luave ever tried to fight the
mess at city hall or the ex-
isting administrative order, is
that Saga is not going to do
anything about it.

Guest Column

So id like you to do
something about it: Tip your
waitress. it each at the pa:
sons at sitdown dinner would
tip his waitress in nickle, the
Wages or these suttcring Saga
servants would be more than
doubled. Now I doubt it you
would even notice that nick-
1e, but — as sure as Saga
Chuck smiles a lot —- your
waitress and hushoy will no-
tice its
we might as well tip as we
do in a real restaurant where
real Waitresses serve real food.
A good nile tor tipping, I am
told, is fifteen per .it at the
total value ot the meal.
While I realize that a nick-
ie is u good deal more than
fifteen perc-t in this case,
I hope that you will have the
pathos to leave a tip at sit-
down tonight. rd like to see
you make this tipping a
tradition. I’d like to see you
lake 3 little action.

ay's Daylight

fort falls to bear any real
imit, it will not be as much
due to weaknesses in the can-
didate’s image and delivery
(and indeed these are numer-
ous — Mr. Day is bookish,
quiet, occasionally given to
glaring grammatical errors,
and about as inspiring a speak-
el' as President Johnson him-
self) as it will be due to weak-
nesses in the candidate’s pock-
et book. While there may be
many voters ill Iowa who
would gladly vole for just a-
bout anybody who is willing to
take a stand in opposition to
the war, Mr. Day’s resources
are so severely limited that it
seems unlikely Lhat he will be
able to reach most of them.
His organization, Peace In-
dependents, just does nut have
the capital needed to [mid the
kind of media » saturation Cam-
paign required to overcome
the large leads held by wellr
founded and well»publlcized
Democratic and Republican can-
didates. Thus, it is not unlikely
that in the final tallies this

Will be only an un atement
or his potential support. Mr,
Day and his backess are well
aware of this, and console
themselves with the statement
that they are “building for ’68"
~ but for what? A lot can hap-
pen ln two years, and at the
rate we are escalating, one
wonders if it will be possible
for anyone to advocate peace
the next time around. The iS-
sue (7i Viet Nam isvhere and

It IS hard not to admire Mr...
Day — as outwardly unimpres-
Sive as he is — for he is a
man who is Willing to take his

a greater than average amount
of personal sacriﬁce to carry
these convictions to the public.
AS an out - of - state voter one
can only stand on the sidelines
and Wish him well, for he is,
in his own small way, serving
more than the voters of Iowa—
he is serving the electorate oi

As ROTC Falls Tolls Knees

By ANNE FARRER

As has been frequently
the bureaucratic structure of

noted by those engaged in
the armed services, there is

duality inherent in the adaption of the military to their
social situation, Because of its mobility, service life is not
conducive to becoming integrated into the community
where the family is stationed; yet the services command
facilities and experience unique to the average Citizen and
which may benefit the community.

To counteract alienation and
develop a social consciousness,
and ioilowing the example at
military who act as good will
ambassadors to foreign commu-
nities, the AFROTC Cadet Corps
is presently on its knees in the

utters of Gl'innell, painting ad-
dress numbers on the curbs of
the 2,000 houses in town,

Utilizing their unique re.
sources, experience and mus-
cles, the cadets have thus far
painted 15o house numbers.
The project Is “the first of this
scope and about which we are
quite optimistic.” according
to Major Albert Omer. As well
as developing in these young
men a social conscience, the
project is of merit to the
cadets in an additional re-
spect — money.

Although it might violate
their budding socialawareness
to charge for their services,
the cadets ask for voluntary
contributions — to date 3130,

cadet being Ba per curb. As
Major Omer noted, this is
roughly concomitant with col-
lege wages, but “dues provide
the cadet with the oppor-
tunity or earning an additional
stipend towards the cost of
education.” lieierring to sen-
ior Jeffrey Cook’s s15 gain,
the implication is that the
cadet now has at his disposal
the means to consume [50 ice
cream cones.

The end, in short, of thls mas-
sive undertaking is that the

may be, or Grinnell will no long—

from the woods and poured
through the gate. Bolts were
removed; the object was head
all its platform. The cars
backed onto the field and the
object was loaded. Mission ac—
complished, the party escaped
back to Grinnell. Art 800 pound
Cornell victory bell had been
liberated.

The group had planned to re.
paint the bell red and black,
with “Grinneli” on one side
and the Smith Hail seal on the
other. The hell would be dis-
played at this week's game and
at the Cornell basketball game

But by 11:00 Monday mom-

will be returned unpainted be-
fore this weekend.

having guessed where the
bell was by early Monday morn-

asked about it, Thompson was
then inlormed where the bell
was by 3&5 and instructed

The Grinnell student courts
anticipate a revision or the coi<
lege handbook and the judicial
system by next spring. They
will spend this year in export
mentation with new policies.

According to Tlm Dailey,
Chief Magistrate of the Men’s
Court, “The court system has
been viewed in Ihe past as too
formal and bogged down in
red Iape." Both representa-
tives of the court and the ad-
ministration agree that sec-
tions at the handbook pertain
ing to court jurisdiction and
penalties are often unneces-
sary and ambiguous. The
courts, consequently, it a v u
been forced, in many cases,
to create a legislative philos-
ophy from case to case.

Barriers between the courts
and the Dean's Committee and
the Faculty Committee on Stu-
dent Allairs have complicated
the problems. Several years
ago, the Chiet Magistrate ot the
Men’s Court resigned, stating
that the “itncalledrfor over<
stepping ol jurisdictional lines
by the administration and fac-
uity" toroed his job and respon-
sibility into “obsolescence."

Linda Neal, Chief Magistrate
or the present Women's Court,
says that court members, the
Faculty Committee tor Student
Affairs and the Deans' Com-
mittee are all working Closely
together this year to try to

The Women‘s Court has vira
tually eliminated hall contine-
ment as a penalty. Failure to
sign in and out is no longer a
court onense; responsibility for
women students who go out at
town is being shifted from the
college back to the student her-
sell. (Under 21 women must
have a blanket permission from
their parents, however.)

Men's court will increase
its eitlclency by eliminating
most iinlng penalties (the we
vious ruling in the frequent
cases of men lacked in the
women‘s loggia after hours).
Hereafter, violations or such
rules will be handled primar-
lly in the halls through warns

Neal, the probation penalty
is intended by the court to he

Sussex students arrive at the

American contemporaries.

"Sussex," states J o n e s,

“An American student attend-

form as "relevant to some oi

in Practical Political Education
(PPPE) announced this week.

Driiry is the author of the
earlier bestseller Advise and
Consent, which was the first
PPPE Political Book- of - the—
Month selection six years ago.
C, Edwin Gilmour, PPPE Di-
rector, noted.

Copies oi‘the new selection,
with two-week circulation privi-
leges, are available at hurling
Library and in the Caucus
Room or Carnegie Hall.

Drury opts with those who
argue that the best answer to
international Communism is the
responsible use or military
strength and force, rather than
through military restraint and
diplomatic negotiations When,
during a revolution in an emerg-
ing African nation, the insur~
gents kill iiity Americans and
destroy American oil facilities,
President Hudson sends planes
and troops to the area,

The incident triggers wide-
spread outcry and opposition
all over the us, led by a Ia-
mous columnist, Walter Dubius,
Whose influence over the entire
communications industry ap-
pears unchallenged. Dobius ai-
tempts to build California Gov-
ernor Jason as an opponent to
the President, in a campaign

that culminates or a rousing,
rowdy political convention in
the Cow Palace in San Fran-
cisco.

“Although cast in a time a
decade or two hence. the novel
finds many parallels today,
both in the central characters
and dominant theme," Gilmour
said.

Spencer Raises Coin

Three members of the Board
of Religion presented a dramat-
ic reading of "The Brothers” in

The reading, given by Dennis
Spencer, .ieII Patterson and
Robert Kinsey, is irom “Come
Sweet Death: A Quartet from
Genesis" by E. Davies Napier,
Dean ol the Chapel at Stanford
University.

“The Brothers” places Cain
In a number or contemporary
occupations. Each oi the mod-
em Cains interprets God’s m-
junction to “do well” as mean-
ing “be successful.” In the
end, Cain kills Abel by his indif-
ference, rationalizing, “Am I

Coach Obermiller was former-

catagorized other student prob»
lems as social, ethical and mor-
al. He stated his opinion that
Gl‘innell has more diiiicnlty in
meeting student need in this
area than in dealing wuh the
less common acute emotional

disturbances. Both Eldridge and
Winters expressed concern for
the student who largely avoids
much social contact during his
stay at Grinnell.

Winters stated that some stu<
dents come to Grinnell “as
naive 17-year-olds and leave
without ever having batted
brains together." The Dean sug-
gested the establishment or a
continuing committee on cam~
pus to deal with improvements
in Grinnell environment.

Eldridge suggests an increase
in small group activity to pro«
Vide better opportunities to: ex—
change between both male and
female students and between
students and faculty. He stated
his belief that the College should
take "a more aggressive role"
in encouraging such activity.

Vcred the idea of the hiring of
an activities counselor.

really surprised anybody, but
they are showing signs they
might. well, maybe next year.

The second half at the sea
son is just getting started and
the surprises are not over.
Smith may have found them-
selves in their win over Clark
and they have yet to play East.
Clark and Gates also meet the
leader in the second half so
plenty can still happen. Dibble
is probably in the best shape,
with Clark as its only tough op-
ponent leit.

My predictions for today and @-

next week are:
Smith over Gates
Dibble over Rawson
Clark over Langan
Dibble over Clark
West nver CDvIles
Smith over Langao
East over Smith
Gates over North
Rawson over Cowles
Dibble and Langan. tossrup

back, a sophomore. is at least
as good or better than their
starter. This is generally re-
ﬂected in their whole line—up.
Moore added that Ripon was
only ahead 10-0 at half-time but
their superior depth lead to the
35 point barrage in the second
half.

The Redmen mix their plays
well although they still love to
throw the ball. Against Knox
they tried 29 passes. The whole
Pioneer secondary will have to

back, and to the hallback in

Coach Bowers considers the
Pioneers underdogs in this
battle but it is not willing to
concede anything. He said
that the Pioneers have a dell-
nite chance in the game for
victory with a great team er.

practices have been spirited
and the squad seems eager
to show that they have the
ability to he a giant-killer.

Last week the Pioneers were
alighny less than giant killers.
Due mainly to the strong run-
ning of Bob Watt. John Eus—
well, Dick Lamb, and Rick
Weeks the Pioneers carried a
23-21 lead late in the fourth
quarter. Watt returned a kickoff
in the second quarter ninety
yards to give the Pioneers an
8-7 lead. Weeks scored two
touchdowns on quarter-
back sneaks, and Lamb and
Eusweii were grounding out
yardage tor the Pioneers all
day.

With about nine minutes left
in the game the Pioneers were
driving, with the two point lead,
toward a clinching touchdown.

The intramural season ls half
over, and the standings are just
about what was expected. In
first place is East Norris with a
5—0 record, Dibble, the early
season pick as probable cham-
pion, is now in second place
with a 51 record, having lost
only to East during the first
week of play. In third place is
Smith, which recovered from an

opening loss to Dibble to win
five games; a tie with Cowles
is the only other blot on their
record.

Surprisingly, Clark swept
through the first three games
handily. suffered a letdown in a
tie with Rawson, and then got
