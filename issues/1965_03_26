In Statement Released by Stauss

Acting President of the College James H. Stauss issued a state-
ment Wednesday designed to settle the lollgrdlscussed problems oi juris-
diction and due process in matters of student misconducli

in a preiace to the Huge statement he wrote, “The tollowing regu-
lations do not represent unanimous agreement at all points among

those who were concerned with these matters, However, they do ,Vol. LXXll

represent substantial and prepon-
derant agreement, some compro~
mise, and a settlement ot issues
which l support."

On the problem oi jurisdiction,
three kiirds ot cases are distin-
giusheu: "cases oi alleged mls~
conduct apprehended by student
Uillccrs," “cases of alleged mis-
conduct brought l0,llle attention oil
student deans, but not appl’e-i
hrndtd by student otiiccrs," and
-~cascs oi alleged misconduct both:
apprehended i student Dlilcers
and lilac, irily brought to tho
uttelitlan at student deans.”

in each instance, the pursue-
non of tire student courts, the
Dozills' Commlllce, and the cul-
ty committee on Student Ali-airs
is outlined. Special cases are also

Senate Goes Out w

ith Whimper, Bang,

Also Speeches, Budgets, Committees

The Student Senate met for its
final session Wednesday evening
and cleared up obstacles in the
path ot its dissolution in commend-
able fashion.

Final reports were heard train
the several student officials and
the Senate ioculty adviser. Ron-
ald Kurtz (anthropology). Kurtz
commended the Senate for several
areas at advancement, including
the achievement of a Successful
student “pressure group.”

In regards to student relations
with college administrators, nuts
going sen President Phil Johnson
said, “Pressure must he used with
caution, and ill the proper form,
but it must be consciously main
tained as a legitimate function” of
student government. _

On the subject of the 5&8, John-
son said. “I suggest that it might
be useful tor the 5&3 to report the
news, instead of always looking
for something to attack, and that
student olticials might try to see
the editor and reporters in a dif-
ferent light than they might View
the Maiia or Typhoid Mary."

Johnson declared, “The north
campus hall system must be
junkedo The present system has in»
bred to culture which is antirintelr
lectual and lacking iir respect tor
individuals."

Proctors might help, Johnson
said, "but the problem Will not
really be solved until it becomes
regular practice to move from one
hall to another each year and the
present inbred cultures are de-
strayed."

Pete Read

An exhibition of over 100
photographs taken recently in
Selma, Alabama, by 5&3 pho-
tographers John Phillips and
Henry withelm is now on dis-
play in the Forum lobby.

 

closed his career by saying, “Stir-
dent government is tinally realiz-
ing that its role as a political pres
sure group is negligible. We must
represent student opinion, but we
shouldn't degrade it‘by tlaunting a
pride-filled, nonexistent force in
the taces or those who sincerely
wish to work with us in creating
the best education for Grinnell
students."

The admissions committee of the
Senate made a tinal report in
which it urged that a permanent
committee be set up by the ad-
Visory council to seek out Out-
standing students “who, though in-
terested in a school like Grinnell,
may not be acquainted with Grin-
nell because of its isolation and
very recent emergence as a lead-
ing college."

The finance committee made
several recommendations t h a t
called tor no major increases in
financing tor the publications and
SGA but asked substantial in-
creases for the social fund.

The report oi the foreign stua
dents board showed that the board
spent about 5700 last year and
earned about 54500.

The Senate next defeated two
resolutions that would appropriate
$300 tor the Military Ball and $100
for the 5&3 from the General Bud-
get arid Reserve Fund. The Sen-
ate then passed a motion that pro-
vided $150 for the Military Ball
from GBKtR.

Additional money necessary for
the dance will come from social
funds, The 5&3 has no means for
recouping most of the loss in-
curred in the recent eight per cent
budget cut, nearly halt of which

 

i would have been restored by pass-
lage oi the resolution.

' As its final act, the Senate
passed a motion to establish a stu-
dent committeemi faculty afiairs.

Faculty Members
Discuss Viet Mom

“The reason the problem in
South Viet Nam is so complicated
is because it cannot be considered
in isolation," James Magee (poli-
tical science) stressed in discuss-
ing the complexity ot the Soutlla
east Asian situation at a coilea
hour sponsored by the Grinnell
Committee on Viet Nam in the
South Lounge Monday.

0n the panel with Magee were
Alan Jones (history), Harold
Fletcher (political science), Ray
mond Betts (history), and Robert
Voertman (economics),

Fletcher stated that the United
States, with its puppet regime,
is fighting a war against the civ-
ilian population of Viet Nam and
described the US. as “hell-bent"
on making a local incident an in-
ternational one. He later said he

Suggestions to Group:

All Issues Important

To the Editor:

I was somewhat dismayed by
the letter in last week’s 5&3 in
which live Grinnellians advocated
that the issue concerning civil

rights in this country was not as
pressing as the United States’ po-
lition in South Viet Nam.

I would like to point out to these
five (unless i misunderstood the
tenor of their letter) that both me
civil rights movement in this
country and the situation in South
Viet Nam should be given equal
attention and not he pitted against
each other in order to determine
which has precedence over the
other. Both issues are vital in their
respective concerns, and hence we
at Grinnell should refrain from
overemphasizing one issue at the
expense of neglecting the other.

does not advocate immediate with
drawal.

Betts questioned one point, say-
ing that the implications of the
situation make this more than a
“local war.” He viewed the US.
failure as resulting from incon—
sistent foreign policy and said that
this policy may prove instrument-
al in forcing the U.S. to extricate
itself from the confusion of the
situation.

Jones termed President John-
son’s bombing raids “understand-
able” despite realistic evaluations
of American success. “Everybody
realizes we will have to get out.
Nobody in Washington believes we

‘ can make South Viet Nam demo-
cratic,” he said. Because of the
political and prestige defeat which
would follow withdrawal, Jones
said he hopes the us. can nego:
tiate a withdrawal under terms
such that Viet Nam would remain
neutral, if only temporarily,

Views of these four panelists
were reflected by Voertman, who
agreed that the Us. is at war
with the Civilians and that our
foreign policy is at fault.

 

Viei Nam Headline
Angers Committee

To the Editorr

Jeremy Wilson’s letter is based
on a misunderstanding created by
the erroneous headline placed
over our letter of last week. A
close reading of our letter will re-
veal that we applaud President
Johnson’s action in Ala ama and
see expanding possib ties for
progress. We hardly advocate
“forgetting civil rights” or even
subordinating that struggle to the
task of making public our criti-
cism of present Viet Nam policy.
It goes without saying that the
struggle is not over; in fact, it has
hardly begun,

Rather, we stated that "there is
another issue present today that
looms over the domestic ﬁght for
civil rights and social equality and
threatens to hinder its progress."
This point was brought up at
Monday‘s faculty-student coffee
hour on Viet Nam. Let me spell
out three dangers that today’s
wrungrheaded pulley poses to prog-
ress at home,

First is the possibility of escala-
tion into thermonuclear war. Then
there is the disastrous effect of a
limited general war in Southeast
Asia. Civil rights are forgotten
during war emergencies. Remem-
ber World War ll?

Finally. if destructive bombing,
gas, and whatever the Joint Chiefs
of Staff have left in their arsenal
don‘t somehow get us to the bar-
gaining table with what is left of
North Viet Nam, then we may
have to pull out — because we will
be forced out. Such a fiasco —- to-
ward which we seem to be headed
— would render great damage to
the President's support at home
and his chances for two terms in
office during which to continue the
drive toward a Great Society.

We hope that all these dangers
will be kept in mind by students
as they also consider the civil
rights struggle. International poli-

tics does have a strong impact on'

domestic policy.

School for Young Apes

(Continued from last week)

For a time things became peaceful again and
faculty and students returned to more mundane af-
fairs such as classes. informal games, and so on.
The underlying tension created by the conflict, how-
ever, did not disappear.

The matter came to a head two weeks later,
during mating season. During this time, according
to tradition, the female apes were locked in their
compound earlier than usual at night, and a heavy
faculty guard stood watch in the surrounding jungle.
(These precautions were not taken to keep the
male apes out so much as they were taken to
keep the females in for everyone knows that dur-
ing this time, no female ape can he held responsible
for her Virtue.) However, one intrepid coed suc-
ceeded in scaling the compound wall and success
fully evaded three faculty members. Stealthily, she
made her way to the male compound, where she
attacked the first ape to come along, dragging
him into the bushes and having her way with him
in spite of his shrill Cries.

Within the week she was brought before the tri-
burial, fined twenty conch shells, and sentenced to
not less than three weeks of social approbation
However, the FTS was again unsatisfied. The coed
was not responsible for her actions, they said, and
they expelled the male ape. This blew the lid off the
kettle, so to speak, and the more militant members
of the student body, who had been crying for DEFIN-
ITlVE ACTION. began to make their influence felt.
Under extreme pressure, the AST Tribal Committee
issued a directive calling for unified student censure
of the faculty, including a boycott of all classes.
The FTS, speaking for the entire faculty, retaliated
by cancelling all classes.‘

After this. blows and counterblows came with

terrifying swlltness. A student demonstration pro-
testing the faculty's refusal to Conduct classes was
broken up by the Goon Squad, a subcommittee of
the FTS. A subsequent faculty demonstration, pro<
testing against students who wanted to come or
classes, was dispersed by the SPG (Student Peace
Group). The tribal chief, still convinced of the POW-
ER 0F REASON. submitted a bitter protest to both
sides against interference with the right of lawful
assembly. The FTS and see countered by selling
him to the Bronx zoo.

The last voice of reason in the student body
having been carted away. screaming in a cage, the
militants took complete control of the AST. Thalr
first move was to seize all of the slingshots and
polished coconut husks which belonged to the ballis—
tical sciences department.

Thus armed, they marched en masse in the di-
rection of the faculty compound, some five hundred
yards northwest of the campus. The Truth Squad,
however, was not caught napping. Arming the facul-
ty wid1 clubs and rocks, they began a flanking move-
ment, hoping to catch the students by surprise be-
fore they reached the compound. An advanced guard
of the AST discovered this move, and the students
spread out in order to counter it. Their strategy hav-
ing failed, the faculty resolved to face the students
ape to ape. As the two dark lines of grim-aced
primates approached each other, lit only by a few
torches, one young ape jumped forward from the
student lines and cried to both sides, “Waitl What
are we doing? This is an enlightened academic
community, not the junglel Aren't we forgetting its

» real purpose?”

“YES I” screamed both sides,

Commencement exercises were indefinitely post-
poned that year.

'loolr Back In Anger' Competent,
Kurascli Says in Review of Play

By Don Kurasch

This week's performance of
John Osbome’s “Look Back In
Anger” was adequately dramatic,
occasionally convincing, but a
had choice of plays to present. The
three actors and two actresses in
this Donahoerdirected drama were
always at least competent, and
occasionally bordered on th e
excellent.

The play was obviously directed
toward an English audience. as it
dealt with certain frustrating con-
ﬂicts regarding class conscious-
nessr The plot revolved around
Jimmy Porter, 3 man from the
lower Classes, an educated man
who married into a higher class,
yet who feels more comfortable
in the presence of Cliff, a close
friend of his Own social stratum.
A rather complete knowledge of
English society and education
would have been necessary to ap-
preciate the impact of this par.
ticular play.

Mike Arnow played Jimmy. Ar-
now’s difficult task was to por-
tray 3. sadistic, frustrated. angry
young man without numbing his
audience to the effect of his con-
stant, often drone~like invective.
This he accomplished through his
actions, as when he was playing
his little games with Cliff, when
climbing various pieces of fumi-

ture, or when walking into the
area of the audience to stare
through an imaginary window.
Though occasionally the staging of
his antics was too obvious, the
overall effect of maintaining the
audience's attention was achieved.

“Lovely" was Lucia Lynner’s
nickname in the play, and as Jim<
my’s wife she was indeed that.
The attractive actress had merely
to be there in the presence of
Jimmy's vituperation to evoke the
audience’s sympathy. And in the
first act, with her often-weak de-
liverance of lines and unmotivated
outbursts, this was the only basis
for that sympathy.

A slightly stronger version of
Lovely was evident in the second
act Miss Lynner's return to the
scene of her best friend embrac—
ing her spouse was powerful, and

the climactic follow-up, when she
crawled in anguish into the arms
of her husband, was the highlight
both of the play and or Miss Lyn-
ner‘s own pedormance.

Deb Bernstine‘s portrayal of
Helena was adequate, though she
never quite proved to be the
“bitch" Jimmy called her before
her arrival. To act convincingly as
one capable ot controlling the
separation and reunion of Jimmy
and Allison, 115 she did, a slightly
5 t r o n g e r characterization was
called for.

As the third corner of an un-
usual triangle, Max Helfgott, in
the role of CH“, did a good job.
Though he occasionally tell prey
to such sluw scenes, as when he
bandaged Allison's arm and was
nearly impossible to hear, Helfgott
convinced the audience of his

“Look Back In Anger” was a

lighting were simple, but apropos
to the stark, simple reality of Os-

so much of plot, but of ideas and
characterization — and at least in
terms of characterization. the ac-
tors and actresses did pull it off.

By Steve nosey

The Pioneer basketball team finished in a tie for last place in
the Midwest conference with Monmouth this year with o poor 513
conference recard~7-15 overall—despite a flock of new scoring records
by Jeff Frantz and the team as a whole.

The most interesting record is the 7M iield goals the Pioneers
made to beat the record Df 703 set by last year's team, which had a 12-
10 record. What happened? This year’s team gave tip 739 field goals and
was outrebounded 994-357 while last year’s team outscored its op.
ponents and set a rebounding record oi1,184.

The most points scored by a Gl'innell opponent until this year
was 102 by Drake, which is a member of one of the toughest basket-,
ball conferences in the country, This year two teams beat that record'
and three others came very close. They were 99 by Bolton, 100 by’
Coe, 101 by Knox, 107 by Beloit again, and 108 by Ripon. ‘

Lack of height docs liui‘L rebounding and defense, of course, but'
lriany small teams make up for that deficiency wuh a scrappy and,
tenacious defense that forces the opponents to take poor and hurricd‘
shots. This keeps the Opponents off balance and allows the defensive
team to grill: rebounds more on y.

hinder tile opponent scoring. It seemed that a disproportionate num-
ber in teams had l‘.0l ll‘ghls against the Pioneers.

Of tlic three teams that tied for first place (Cox’tlcll, St. Olaf, and
Ripon), Olaf Emil Ripon finished fitst and second ill the league in
team dclense, Corncll had such a powerinl scot'lllg und rebounding
corps, led by Jack Grams and Rich Glaslel‘, that they could slack‘
off a little on defense, but they were still sixth iii the league, I

where were the Pioneers in league defense? Buried in last place
75.6 points a game behind Monmouth, 10.1 points behind Coincll. and
a whopping 15.7 and 16A points a game behind cDrCliamplons Ripon andl
St. Olaf.

We also find that Olaf and Ripon are in seventh and eighth re-
spectively in team offense. The Pioneers were way up in third place,
behind only Beloit and Cornell.

The big question lor next year's team is not whether they can
Score —- for [liEy have already shown this ability, and four of the
five iop scorers from this year are returning ~ but whether the team
c'an develop a consistently stronger delense and add to it some tough
rebounders to help Jeff Frantz, who was the only Pioneer at all effective
on the boards. If this happens, Grinnell will be a respected power
in the league and could battle for the Conlerence crown.
