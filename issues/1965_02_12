Knopf Discusses Elimination of Interim,
Cites Need for More Independent Study

By Alan Axelrod

"The faculty generally
agreed that the interim wasn’t
doing the job and that we need
to get at other ways of inde-
pendent study," said Kenyon
Knopt (economics), chairman

' of the faculty, when asked
about the faculty decision to
’ discontinue the interim session.

Knopf observed that “the stu»
dents' educational process has
been developed in terms of
formal structure—credits, as-
signments and grades. To slip
that little bit of time in and
expect very much in the way
of independent study is unreal<
istic."

He felt that a college needs
to build gradually into its stu-
dents the ability and desire to
pursue knowledge for its own
sake. ”I think we can do a lot
more in the way of encourag<
ing students to undertake inde<

 

pendent study, but there are
no formulas to get the job
done,"

Knopf pointed out that there
is much more work outside of
class now than there was ten
years ago. He felt. however,
that students need to be en-
couraged to broaden mem-
selves by doing reading out:
side of their major areas.

“One test of a good college
education would be to inter-
view people 15 years after they
graduate and see if they have
done much reading outside of
their professions To develop
the kind of desire needed for
this sort of reading is, of course,
one of the fundamental pur-
poses of a liberal arts educa-
tion," he said.

Knopf recalled that the in-

568 of the students answering had

were opposed to such a proposal.

member saw varying weaknesseu
in the college makeup

Moderated by Reginald Archam-
bault (education), the panel sought
to explore his assumption, ”What
we have is very good; how do we
make it excellent?”

Cleaver opened the discussion by
pointing to the distinction between
saying, “that unless we experience
knowledge in more than a cerebral
sense, it is not very good knowl-
edge."

He said, “The passion at Grin-
nell for learning is at somewhat
less than a screaming pitch.”

Cleaver advised more seminar
work and more involved participa-
tion in place of detached apprecia-
tion, particularly in the fine arts.

Agreeing with Cleaver, Fletcher
blamed the lack of depth in leam-
ing on the racetrack aspect of the
curriculum. He said students and
professors alike are hurried and
regimented.

“The atmosphere is one of great
pressure, and this situation is gen-
eraily unsatisfactory," said Fletch-
er.

The solution, he said, was in I

tion at Swarthmore Where the num-
ber of courses during the last two
years of study is reduced from

Fletcher Said these classes of not

with much of the initiative com-
ing from the students themselves.

Many oi the present mid-term
and final examinations would b0
eliminated under this system, ad-
ded Fletcherl He also observed
that such a system would “assum'
considerable maturity on the part
of the student.”

Fletcher noted that he was cau<
tiously optimistic about this ma-
turity despite the mass exodus
from campus during the interim
period

Archambault characterized and,

divided college life into day-time
and night-time activity. He said
that during the day the student
crosses into central campus and
becomes a student, but when he re-
turns at night he changes into a

The ln’rerim Poll

The 5&3 poll on the interim taken last Tuesday
in the lunch lines was fairly successful in terms of the
number of students answering and in terms of infor—
mation gleaned. Fifty»seven per \cent of the student
body is a good representation, and an examination of
the result yields some worthwhile information and
leads to several suggestions

A strong majority agreed with the decision to do
away with the three—year—old interim experiment. And,
indeed, the poll did indicate that the lectures were
poorly attended and that over half the students left
campus for more than a day during the interim. ,

Nonetheless, the results of several questions in-
dicated that the interim was not such a terrible flop
and that much independent study was undertaken.

Over 60 per cent of those answering felt that they had‘

benefited intellectually from the interim, and 87 per
cent read at least one book during that time.

It appears that a period of independent study does
benefit a large portion of the students We would hope
that the statement by Chairman of the Faculty Kenyon
Knopf printed in this issue of the SSzB is followed up
and that other arrangements for independent study are
tried,

Other questions on the poll concerned the use
of interim for studying for the Junior Liberal Arts
Exam and senior comprehensives. Juniors and seniors,
by a Z»l margin, felt that the interim offered a good
opportunity to study for their respective tests The
same people, by almost the same margin, did not
eel that they could have studied as well over the
Christmas vacation.

Although the people who made the decision to
drop interim have pointed out that the lengthened
Christmas vacation of three weeks should provide
enough time for juniors and seniors to prepare for their
tests, there is also a feeling, as expressed in a letter to
the editor this week, that it is often impossible to study
at home. In many cases the research facilities just
aren‘t available, and in other cases it is simply incon-
venient to study at home.

Juniors and seniors ought to be allowed to return
to campus before second semester classes begin to
study for their tests

The results of this poll and the proposals made
above should be considered seriously. Some time should

be allotted' for independent study in the new calendar,
and juniors and seniors should be allowed to return to
Grinnell early to study for JLA and comps. . . ' _

' Shades of Gray
What The New World Halh Wroughl

By Carl Otis Gray

She stands as a symbol for all that is pure
and noble, for all that is good and kind, for
that certain superiority that marks our civili-
zation. She is the physical embodiment of
Florence Nightingale, Cleopatra, The Virgin
Mary, Brigette Bardot, and Queen Victoria
all rolled into one. She possesses that hybrid
vigor, that “melting-pot" essence that de-
scribes our society. She is, of course, the
American White Woman.

Indeed, she is the shining example of
American civilization from her Revlon lac-
quered toenails to her lpana brightened
smile to her dazzling Lady Clairol hair ~—
all that and only her hairdresser knows for
sure. Truly she has only one life and she
chooses to live it as a blonde. Though nature
had designs to have her pursue her destiny
as a raven haired beauty, it denied the Anglo-
Saxon in her; the Mediterranean strains were
forced to surrender to the overwhelming
forces of hydrogen peroxide Now with the
help of a skilled lens grinder she can have
eyes as blue as the Baltic. And Helena Ruben-
steili has seen to it that her dark olive com-
plexion need no longer be mistaken as He-
braic or something even worse; she can go
from Florida tan to city white in less time
than it takes to powder her nose.

To the American White Male she repre-
sents the American Dream 7 straight from

Scandinavia. Like her male counterparts she
is concerned with the great social problems
that dominate her generation and although
her concern never reaches the limits of in-
volvement she prides herself ‘on her aware-
ness and duty as an American. Thus, she has
all the potentials for the American Wifea
beauty, and awareness.

Most important, to the American Nonrwhite
Male she is that unattainable superiority,
that forbidden delicacy, possessor of that
contraband kissi Inviolable she is the thing
that he spends his whole life lusting after,
grabbing for, worshipping, molesting. He,
the sexually superior brute that he is, will
go to any extreme to procure from her just
one taste of that ultimate intimacy. Thus,
she must be protected, sheltered, hidden, iso-
lated from the ugly forces of interracial love.
Though her brother, American White Man,
may indulge in such indiscretions provided
there is a cash and carry relationship, Amer-
ican White Woman is denied the degradation
regardless of the financial propositions put
forth.

From May Britt to Little Eva she is that
which must be protected as we protect the
rights of the individual. She must be idolized
as we idolize the flag that represents a nation
under God. She must be free to realize her
potential just as much as every oth er
American with its ideals of God, country and
motherhood.

I would like to express an opinion

tainly in favor at having examina-

because I have long telt the futility
of attempting to study at home
during Christmas vacation. From
past experience, i have round that
students arrive home tor the holi-

physically and mentally. than at

it has always seemed to be quite
unrealistic tor the faculty to as-
sign papers during this convales-
cent period.

I am disturbed about classes
beginning September 6, Labor Day.
It had never dawned on me that
Grinnell College would ever begin
classes on a national holiday when
it is practically a national habit to
begin the academic year after this
date. As a result, in applying for
summer jobs. l committed myselr
to staying through Labor Day. I
have applied to summer resorts.
It seems to me that I can correctly
say that most summer jobs expect
college students to arrive the sec.
ond week in June and to stay
through Labor Day. This is par
ticularly the case with national
park and resort jobs. For example,
Glacier National Park requires
its employees to work irom June
15 to September 15. And I would
be willing to say that many Grin-
nell students work in jobs which
have these stipulations. Therefore,
I do not understand Dean Stauss'
statement, as reported in the 5&3,
that employment would be easier
if school were to and earlier. I
rattler think that the reverse is
true.

I think that it would be a good
idea if students whose summer
employment is affected by the new
calendar proposal would write to
Mr. Siauss. After all, most of us
do help finance our education
through summer employment.

adults and institutions must set

Robert Bendiner blames the

for the frustration of the public

Archamhault posed the question
of which of the two cultures should
move toward the other. His an-

should move more in the direction
of the Scholar’s style

He noted that faculty-student
bull sessions on "the existential
me" would not do the job.

Erickson shifted the focus to the
conflict between professional pre-
paration and a liberal education.
He said, “The proper iunotion of
a liberal arts college is to de-

the problem of scholarship and
teaching. He deﬁned a scholar as

Grinneil should be both teacher and

of the villagers belong to the

the bulk of the army of Shivaji, the
Hindu rebel»hero, in his revolt
against the Moghul rule during the
17th and 18th Centuries. After the
consolidation of British mle, they
took up farming where they have

the actual organization of the labor
is done by the villagers themselves
through the traditional leadership
patterns. in adition to these activi-
ties, the Project works closely with
the Zilia Parishad, Government,
rural community level agency for
the improvement of agricultural
production and village weliare.
Students at the college who elect
a major in Economics or Sociology
have the opportunity to participate
in the Rural Life project in order
to gain practical experience with
rural social and economic condia
tlons. Because this work requires
long hours spent in villages and
occasional manual labor which is
associated with low caste jobs and
socially distasteful to some, not as
many participate in the Project
as might be hoped. Nonetheless,
in the three years of the Project's
existence rather astonishing re-
sults have been achieved. It must
be remembered that the Village
population is deeply rooted in their
traditional way of life and there-
iore somewhat suspicious of mod-
ernization because it brings with
it social changes to which the
traditional pattern cannot adjust
itself. The fear of social chaos as
a result of economic betterment is
in the backs of these people's
minds. The first things that must
he done is to convince them that
poverty is not an unalterable con-
dition in their lives, a better life is
not only possible, but Within their
reach. When they are willing to
listen, they must be shown how
this can be done. in response to
this challenge, the Project has un-
dertaken certain experiments to

 

demonstrate what is possible. in

 

 

 

 

 

PATILS of four village: consider the project.

Neighbors Inc. Under the able
leadership of Prof. S. K. Hulbe and
a faculty of four economics pro—
Iessors, the project is presently di-
recting work in land reclamation,
village housing construction, im«
provement of farming methods,
and education, Although much of
the leadership work is handled
through the Rural Life Project,

one village, as an example, they
provided the necessary 'materials
for the construction of a medical
clinic. The village Patil, or head-
man, organized the village into
constniction teams. After the clinic
was built and they saw what they
had done, the villagers were so
pleased with themselves that they
carried on and built a community

h,all library and an addition to the
village school which doubled its
capacity.

In the case of the village of Kol-
hewadi, the college’s Work there
to date has centered in two main
areas: land reclamation and housA
ing construction. The land around
the village is rocky and dry, re-
ceiving only some eighteen inches
of rainfall which is dumped on the
land during the June to September
monsoon. If the rains come too
late, the seed will not sprout due
to the dryness of the soil; if they
come too early, it means a longer
dry season and the risk of a poor
yield. In the files of the Govern-
main: office, Kolhewadi i listed
under the heading, ‘ Famine

Area ” To the human beings who
spend their lives in this village, it
means uncertainty, and in a dry
year, hardship and starvation.
Under the leadership of Prof.

.I-lulbe and the staff of the Rural

Life Development and Research
Project, extra land has been pro-
cured from the Government. The
students and village men and wom-
en work together to clear rocks
from the heretofore uncultivated
slopes. it is a slow process, each
rock must be lifted by hand and
each iurrow must be plowed by
oxen. it is a slow process, but it
means the difference between
enough food for these 375 people
and malnutrition and despair.

created to accommodate the
kind of incentive that would
lead to independent study.

"A time for studying for the

“Furthermore. the Rosent‘eld

Knopf believes that the at-

be maintained, “but with a dif-

for example, people who find
certain lectures relate to ma-

Five seniors from seminaries
of several different tradition:
will be on campus from Sun-

the Board of Religion.

The seminarians will stay
in residence halls on North

ing With students and faculty
in discussions and conversa-
tions.

A panel considering the ques-
tion “ls Religion Going to
Church?” will be held Sunday
night at 8:00 in the South
Lounge of the Forum. The
panel will consist of the five
seminarians with a student
moderator and it will kick of!
three days of more informal
discussions.

T h a following seminarians

general topic of civil rights.

 

As the seminarians are from
schools of widely varying tra-
ditions. a broad range of outa
look is expected by the Board

'of Religion.

Two general meanings of the
question under consideration
are “Is the religious life con-
stituted in attendance at wor-
ship services?” and “Is res
gious concern becoming trapped
or stratified in 8nd identifiable
only with a sterile institution?"

Other questions under con-
sideration, and related areas
will be “What constitutes re-
ligious life?” “How important
are formal religious observ~
ances?" “What, exactly, is the
nature of religious observance
in the various traditions of
faith?" “What relevance has
institutional religion to the life
of the college student?" and
"What are the goals of the in-
stitutional ministry and the na-
ture and worth of seminary
education?"

T h e seminarians will be
staying in college dormitories
and dining with students while
they are here. In addition. gen-
erous opportunities will be
available for individual confer-
ences with interested students,
as well as informal conversa<
tion.

Schedules will be posted in
the halls, and there will be a
student in each hall who will

Jim Young to Teach Karate Class.
Encourages Sport as Carry-over

By Kris Nash

One of Grinnell's thorniest
problems in recent years has
been the physical education res
quirement—but Jim Young has
the answer. His karate class
provides a swift, agile; and
healthful solution for students
who are stumped over the se-
lection of a worthwhile carry-

»over sport. Karate is a practi-
cal means of self—defense for
both men and women, as well
as supplying an interesting
means of earning either a ma~
jar or a minor in physical edu»
cation.

Young began teaching this
particular brand of self-defense
during his freshman year, when
he teamed with a jujitsu in-
structor to give lessons to bond
students and local residents.
Young, a “brVWn belt” then,
has advanced to "black-belt,"
which is the highest color-rank
which a karate man may
achieve. There are six progres
sive levels of skill in the “black
belt" classification, each of
which requires about four
years of active training and
preparation before advance-
ment.

Participation in
has been rewarding, with
Young’s dropout percentage
running far below the adver-
tised national percentage. Cur-
rently there are four students
who have fulfilled the require-
ments for a karate major and
are taking even further instruc-
tion —— Steve Chandler, Don
Dietrich, Jim Fox, and Peggy
Gerber. Although the karate
students often are regarded as‘
a group who are being taught
rough, dirty tactics, Young
stresses that this is not the
case.

He points out that half of his
beginning class is usually made
up of girls. Though many of
them drop out before Complet—
ing any requirement, Miss Ger-
ber is an example of what can
he achieved. Young emphasizes,
for students who are leery, that
there are surprisingly few ser--
ious injuries suffered in the
sport. The Grinnell karate class
has never had a serious injury.

The origin of karate was
based in China, at least 600
years ago. It is thought to have
been developed by a group of
itinerant Buddhist monks as a
means of protection against
robbers who frequented the

the class'

 

roads in those days. The study

of karate next grew widespread
in Okinawa, following the de-
cree of an Okinawan warlord
that people were to be forbid—
den the use of weapons. There
are some styles of karate exist-
ing in Which the barehanded
practitioners train to take on
armed opponents

Although most uninformed
people automatically associate
karate with Japan, the Japan
ese did not practice it until
1917r It was in Japan, however,
that karate first began acquir
ing the sporting characteristics
which distinguish it today.
The Japanese were the first to
practice together; previously,
karate had been something at
w hi c 11 individual devotees
trained alone. Japan put karate
on a generally more scientiﬁc
basis, and Korea and China
have followed its lead.

Karate places its emphasis
on the use of punches and kicks
as the means of defense. Most
other forms of the weaponless
self-defense arts stress throw-
ing an adversary, such as in
"aikido," where maneuvers
cannot be executed without use
of the opponent’s momentum.
Jujitsu also relies chiefly on
throwing the competitor, as
does judo, which is the sport-
ing modification of original
jujitsu. .

Th e style which Young
teaches is that of the Japan
Karate Association, a style
which he is convinced is the
best. Having observed aikldo'
judo, Korean karate, and prac~
thlEd them to an extent, the
slight senior expresses definite
preference for the I. K. A.
brand of defense. The Japan
Karate Association is one of
the largest organizations in Jar
pan, and the only group sanc—
tioned by the Japan Ministry of
Education to teach karate in
foreign lands. Japan Karate
Association style of defense
employs linear blocking and!
punching movements, and is‘
based upon “kime,” which is
the precise focusing of a per»
son's entire strength into one
small striking a'rea.

Young first began his train-
ing in Hawaii, where he was a
pupil of Kanazawa, twice the
all-Japan champion in both the.
“forms" and iree~combat d1"
visions of competition karate.
He was initially forced to e -

enrolled in a class of 200, To-
day there are ten times as
many people studying karate
in Hawaii. After working .up to
the "brown belt“ level in the
islands, Young trained for an
additional one and one-half
years before achieving “black
belt“ standing. He qualified as
a first-level “black belt“ in
Philadelphia during Christmas
vacation of his sophomore year,
though he did not actually re-
ceive the belt until the follow—
ing summeri

The blond senior plans to do
graduate study in electrical en-
gineering at the University of
Arizona or the University of
Michigan, then perhaps acquire
3 Ph. D. after working a year.
He eventually hopes to return
to Hawaii to work. There he
will be able to continue his
training in karate, as well as
in Japanese archery, in which
he holds a “brown belt” equiv-
alent.

For his final semester at
Grinnell, Young has planned a
training schedule which will
provide helpful intermingling of
advanced, intermediate, and
beginning Classes while at the
same time allowing adequate

Pioneers Fall to Cellar with Losses
To Coe and Beloii Over Weekend

By Steve Casey

The Grinnell basketball team
lost two important ball games last
weekend and were dumped into
last place in the Midwest confer-
ence. Poor shooting and rebound-
ing were directly responsible for
the defeats in both contests.

Against Coe the Pioneers were
thoroughly outclassed by the husta
llng Kohawks. The Pioneers tried
the 1-3-1 zone defense that was ef-
fective against Augustana, but
sharp quick passes by Coo solved
that defense. Coe then spurred to
a 22-11 lead

After Coe scored on several easy
lay ups, Grinnell shifted into a
man-to-rnan defense which was a
little more effective. The Pioneers
cut their deficit to five points with
six minutes left but could get no
closer, Coe came back and took
‘ 39-30 halftime lead.

Coe took complete command in
the second half. The Kohawks'
leading scorer, Skip Swan, and
guard Mike Collis started scoring
and Coe pulled away to a Sixteen
point lead with twelve minutes 1‘8-
mainingl Then in these last twelve

 

minutes while Gi‘innell could only
manage to score nine points, Coe
Scored freely and eventually won
80-53.

Frigid shooting by Grinnell and
hot shooting by Coe was the differ»
ence. Grinnell could only hit on
30% of their shots, including 26%
in the second half, while Coe netted
51% of their shots. Coe also took
command of the backboards by
nut-rebounding Grinnell 45-26.

The Beloit game completed the
disastrous weekend, This game was
similar to the cue game except that
Beloit clinched the game by half-

time when it held a nearly incur:

mountable 54-36 lead. The second
half saw the second stringers getr
ting plenty of action with twelve
different Pioneers and eleven dif-
ferent Buccaneers eventually scor»
ing.

Grinnell’s shooting improved ov-
er the previous night, but unfnr~
tunately Eeloit had a hot night to
easily overcome Grinnell’s im-
provement. The Pioneers connected
on 42% of their shots but the Buc-
caneers hit 55% of their shots. Be-
loit also humbled the Pioneers in
rebounds 49-30.

SCARLET AND BLACK

By Paul Trigg

Although I have promised the editor that I would not resort to the
Clark nail level of discussing intramural sports, last week's Animal
Life column and Mr. Haveman’s allegation at last Tuesday night's
coffee hour that there is a lack at student incentive in scholarly pur-
suits have triggered me into prognosticating the Women’s intramural
basketball race. i attempt this analysis with two goals: to prove that
the writers of that column were in error when they predicted Loose
hall would Win tile championship, and to do this in such a fashion as
to assure its comprehension even by sportswriters who seem to have
trouble reading. 1 also attempt this under what i thought was an ob-
vlous assumption a that Loose hall is only eligible for the 1M league
on south Campus.

in picking Loose hall to win the basketball championship, my car
horts neglected the fact that lowa is the only state in the midwesi,
and one of the few states in the country, in which girl’s high School
basketball is played. Therefore, Iowa is the primary “recruiting
ground" of the midwest. Because of this factor, it. is not the hall with
the most out of state talent, but rather the hall with the most Iowa-bred
personelle which has the best chance of securing first place. Thus,
the obvious choice for the 1M championship is Cleveland hall which
houses 18 healthy, intellectual, corn—fed iowa girls.

Speaking of basketball, 1 promised three weeks ago that after the
University of lowa played U.C.L.A. and Michigan 1 would discuss
their situation again. i must confess that the Hawks fared somewhat
better than I thought they would. i did not see the U.c.L.A, game.
but from all accounts they beat the Bruins thoroughly with a very
strong game. I did see the Michigan game, however, which unfortu-
nately became a debacle. It must be a real nightmare to turn over
the ball seven straight times without a shot, or to watch your opponent
score 19 points in a row, but these things as well as the entire game
can be explained by three factors. First, and most obviously, the Hawks
played a poor game. Secondly, they lack experience which showed up
when faced by Michigan's awesome power and talent. Thirdly, Iowa
has no depth. Most of the time they have only four first rate players
on the noon As 1 stated earlier, they are a year away from having an
excellent team. With the addition of a few junior college transfers or
members of this year’s trosh team, they could win the title next year.
