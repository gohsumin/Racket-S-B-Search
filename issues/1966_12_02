Sludenl Leaders Commenl
On Goals. Plans for Future

By SUZANNE GELBER

"Progress, thus far, has been
more superficial than real," ree
marked SGA President Steve
Kent, expressing the opinions or
the SGA Executive Cabinet on
the administration reaction to
rules protest during a noon
meeting Wednesday with 5&3
reporters. Karen Lauterbach,
AWS Board president, added
that “most significant campus
reform during the past four
years — te, pass-tail, and the
reinstitution Di interim — has
come about only through Slii<
dent initiative and agitation.”

The student government of-
ficials feel that the focus of
activity is once again wom-
en’s hours, which will most
lutely not be instituted until
next tall because some people
feel counseling lacilities must
be expanded, “We believe
that the provision or more
adequate counseling services
is a legitimate concern or the
administration in this case,”
commented Karen.

“Student protest." said Bob
Foote. “did not accomplish its
basic purpose re the illcgal vie
itatioil case a to change Presi»
dent Leggett’s decision about
suspension. However, it did
open the door {or administra-
tion clarification of its rules
policy and this is at least a
limited victory." Tile student
courts are now considering the
significance of morality as a
relevant factor in judicial hears
lugs.

SGA President Steve Kent

offered the following state<
merit:

“I have a conception of
Grinnell. or, more accurately,
— oi what Grlnneil was and
wants Io be, as a tnily liberal,
radical, innovative and assert-
ive place. It’s not on original
idea but one I’ve acquired
since coming to Grlnnell and
one which i think a lot oi
Grinnellians hold.

“The decision to suspend
the three students for the rest
or the academic year and the
trepidations involved hi the
whole process that led up to
that decision, I think raise
some doubts as to the validity
of my conception The cir-

Courts Hear Violators'
“Concern for Community"

By HAROLD FUSON

In a tense atmosphere clouded by unfriendly silences and
bitter glares, the Faculty Committee on Student Attairs and the
deans sat along with the student primary courts in hearing the

cases of 19 AWS Board and
CoiHP members who de-
liberately broke the College's
visitation rule last week.

Women's court chief magis
irate, Linda Neal, opened the
Sunday aiternoon session in
Gardner Lounge with a brief
discussion 01‘ the student courts'
approach to violations. Miss
Neal noted that evidence of a

Leggeii Rejects
Siudenis' Appeal

By HENRY WlLHELM
Last Sunday President Glenn
Leggett rejected the final ap-
peal of Robert Hanenberg,
Michele Anderson and Frank
Knowltori to reduce the suspena
siorl penalties given them by
the Faculty Committee on Stu-
dent. Affairs.

Leggett said: “I lelt physi-
cal separation from the cam<
pus was the proper choice
considering all the available
alternatives.” He said that
the students would be per-
mitted to take their final
exams for this semester “in
nbsentls." They will also be
allowed to enroll as Gﬁnnell
students in another college or
university, or in any of Grin-
nell’s off-campus programs
for which they may be eli-
gible, Credits earned will be
lransferred to and accepted
by Grinnell College."
when the case was reviewed
by the Committee on Student
Affairs Leggett was out or town.
He said, however, that he had

the problem" and within the
discussion to realize a “resulth
tion of the Conflict." While this
case constituted an “expanded
court session,” the procedure
would remain the same, “Still

volved."

AWS Board President Karen
Lauterbach opened the delensu
followed by Coil-KP President
Robert Foote.

Miss Lauterbech stressed
that at no time was the vio-
lation “the result of either
isolated or impulsive acllon
on onyone‘s part.” There

(ion was conceived as a “rep-
resentative action by a rep
resentative group intended to
express the concern of these

The violation according to
Miss Lauterbach was something

Miss Lauterbach stressed that

Trouble Ahead

Last week’s “illegal visitation” by members of the AWS Board
of the Com? will apparently bring about a clarification oi the col-
lege’s policy relating to violatlons of visitations rules and premari-
tal sex among students.

This week President Leggett told the 5&3: “On this matter of
Illegal Visitation which extends overnight, I just don’t have an open
mind on this . . Leggett observed that within the last genera-
tion of college students there has been a marked change of attitude
toward premarital sex; “it used to be that ii a boy spent the night
with a girl they would be immediately expelled and no questions
would be asked” But now, as evidenced by the demonstratiomlast
week, some students are taking a diiierent attitude about it. Leg-
gett said "Maybe the time has come that we must put some sort
oi statement on premarital sex in the catalog. Maybe the time has
come that the small college must say this is the climate of opinion
and values we have here."

Leggett has, by his own admission, changed his mind about
his ptevrous statement on in loco paientis, (“I don’t believe in the in
loco parentis concept The time is gone when the administration of
a college can regulate student morality. . . son September 10,
1965). .

For his current view oi in loco parentis Leggett pointed to a
recent magazine article on small colleges ln which he was quoted:
“All societies are founded on the idea of in loco parentis. . . . It
depends on what kind of parent you're talking about. We don’t be-
lieve in tyrannical control, but neither do we believe in abdication."
.(Ltulk, October 4, 1966).

Leggett says he sees the function and nature of the small col-
lege as very much dillerent titan the large university and gave the
opinion that die small college cannot encompass the variety of
geople and behaviors that the university can, “What you want is

omogeneity in academic and r i i in moral standards."

Leggett indicated that it was a function of the college to estab-
lish the “proper environment” ior students to live in and be rightly
recognizes the interrelationship ot academic and non-academic life.

But as recent statements from Leggett (see article on page 1,
"Leggett Rejects Students’ Appeal”), the administration's “advis-
ing" oi the Faculty Committee on Student Aliens in their decision
X0 suspend three students and the administration’s inﬂuence which
prompted the censorship of “The Chairs” (see 5&8, October 7 and
14) all indicate, Leggett and the deans intend to not only decide
What sort of “environment” the Grinnell student should have but
also what sort or penalties will be given to violators.

We think this is a matter or concern for students and faculty
alike. We think the inclusion of “moral guidelines”, defined by the
administration, on matters or student conduct has very serious and
very negative implications, We think the administration may he on
the verge of taking a major step backwards in its quest for the
“homogeneous moral and academic community.”

. Because of the current trend toward liberalization of rules in
most schools across the country, Grinnell and other small schools
like it may soon find themselves to be rather alone with rule Struc-
tures that Eliseo vivas recently termed "vestiges of the 19th Cen-
tum”

In a recent New York Times survey of eastern college rules
(April 25, 1966 page 1:7) Ruth Darling, assistant dean for residence
halls at Cornell (New York), where junior and senior girls have to
check into their dorms only once a day, said: We don’t ask what
they do and we don’t want to know, We don’t ask because the girls
are presumed to be responsible.”

The article commented: “Not one university official inter-
viewed expressed dissatisfaction wiih the results of the liberalized
rules — although several said they expected serious trouble." Co-
lumhia, Cornell. Fordham, New York University. Princeton and
yaie were included in the survey; almost all have legal visitation
hours that vastly exceed Grinnell’s three hours per week. We would
rather not believe Grinnell is really that different or that the stu-
dents are significantly less mature than their eastern counterparts.

We commend the efforts this year of student government to
bring the relevant issues up for discussion and we commend the en-
lightened attitude oi the student courts in taking a constructive
counseling approach to student problems. We compare this with the
administration's seemingly hysterical need to “separate ironi the
campus" violators of an antiquated sexual ethic,

We think the idea of the “community court” is a good one;
whether or not it will work depends largely on the attitude of the ad-
ministration. It would appear that the gulf between the administra-
uon's “separation is necessary" and the student courts' “a severe
warning the first time” attitudes may be too much [0 breach

. We also see serious difficulties facing SGA in their attempts to
bring the college more in line with the reality of the present student
generation. in a speech given at Parents Weekend last year (0ctn~
her is, 1965) Leggett said:

. . our colleges are managed by students, but I hope
only in the sense that their welfare, not their voles, decide
what lS_ to be done, Surely mdent government exists because
it provides an arena of trai rig and a way of communication
between faculty and students, not because ot any genuine
political necessrty. what it comes down to is that neither
college otncials our parents want to find themselves in a
KYstem where the political and social rights of students are
confused with their academic welfare and allowed to warp
it on the grounds that a Student cannot be denied in college
all the freedoms he has in his outside society. Students
should not be encumbered with rules. Their society in the
long‘run probably needs to be self regulating; but. college
officials,_ not students have to define the environment in
which this seltreguialing society is to operate, and it students

Valid Generalizations

i suppose that in writing a
column, 1 take on a responsibil-
ity. In analyzing the word "re»
Sponsibility,” I find that it
breaks down into the ability to
respond, which, it Antigone is
right, i must do if I can. 1 do
believe in Antigone.

The questions, then, are,
“What do I respond to?" and
“How do I respond?" i could re-
spond to my internal reﬂection,
write a monologue, a stream“-
consciousness nonsense story.
but that just doesn't seem right.
I mean right in any way you
want to conceive or it: morally
right, pragmatically, or purely
emotionally right. You can
choose of these because I feel
that I ought to respond to exter-
nal stimuli (the school) rather
than internal stimuli (myself);
it would be better, for the news-
paper and the school, if the col-
umn were relevant; and, by
God, I just want to talk about
what is going on.

Now, how dol respond? First,
there has to be a reason to re-
spond, a point to make, a rele-
vant comment. Up until this
point, i have been writing with
one principle in mind: go to

the extreme to get the point
across. It’s just like teaching it
small Child not. to take cookies
from Lhe cookie jar; to make
your point, you don’t say, “No,
no, bad, bad." You give him
a solid smack on the rear end.
Sn 1 have attempted to go in
an extreme with points, hoping
that students, intelligent enough
and, therefore, indignant
enough to tone down the ex-
rremism, would happen upon
exactly the point I was trying
to make. In some cases, it
worked.

But, lo and behold, as some»
one very gently pointed out to
me, there is a large dinerence
between the extreme and the ir-
rational. One doesn't make any
point by being irrational except
the point that he is irrational,
And perhaps this mistake oi
confusion and extreme, as a
method of making a point, with
the irrational, or beyond reason,
was committed this past week
by the student leaders of the
College. In thinking that the
protest was merely going to am
extreme to make a point, per-
haps they slipped into the ir-
rational by not exhausting all

possible means within the sys-
tem before going outside of it in
committing an illegal act.

It would be unfortunate if
they thought that they were ny-
ing to elicit a "flexible policy"
of handling student violations,
while actually, that is just what
they were combatting: a “tiexa
ible policy” is a contradiction
in terms, besides being a great
danger to justice it merely by
the fact that the extreme limit
use of the word ”flexibility” is
“whim". On whose whims do
you wish to depend? Do you
want whim or do you want a
more liberal policy, on “ameli-
oration” of the punitive mettle
ods used with regard to rule
violators? Do you want whim
or do you want a definite, struc-
tured guideline upon which to
base a legal system?

P e r h a p 5 these questions
should have been answered be
fore you protested; and if you,
the student leaders, have an-
swered them, why didn’t you
give the student body a chance
to see and perhaps amend your
conception of the student body's
desires? Perhaps you acted too
hastily. —Paul R. Jones

 

Letters . . .

To the Editor:

The recent suspension of
three Griniiell students has
served to highlight three cen-
tral issues, the clarification
and analysis of which are long
overdue by both faculty and
students. The most pervasive
and tundamental issue concerns
the role of Grinnell College in
US. society at this time. is
the College to be dominantly an
encuiturator or received ideas,
teelings, and patterns of be-
havior or is it to be dominant
ly a place where the received is
critically scrutinized and the
new totmulated and tested? is
Grinncli College to be a center

tor dissent and radical innoya»
tion or for the turtherance of,
at best, a discriminatingly slits
ed status quo? Answers to these
questions have implications ior
the type of student the College
admits, the type of faculty it
attracts, the amount and source
of tinancial support available
to it, and the types of “aca-
demic“ programs it offers

A second pervasive issue, one
closely related to the iirst is,
what shall Grinncll College
mean by "education"? Does
"education” refer to gaining
familiarity with and verbal
fluency in the conceptual cate-
gories and frameworks that have
dominated western and eastern
thought in the past and cur-
rently without attending expli—
citly to the relevance or these

 

do not find this environment to their taste, then the adjust
ment is theirs, not the college’s to make. and it is a matter

of honesty to announce it.”

We think the administration is a little confused about what
Dean S. Eugene Thompson recently referred to as “. . . the line
between caring about young people and caring ior young people."

We are worried about the kind of student who will come to a
school that takes the condescending views of students' ability to
run their own personal lives that Grinnell does.

Henry Steele Comniager, writing in the Saturday Review (Aug-
ust 27, 1%6) on “The Nature 01 Academic Freedom" said:

“The notion that the University should act "in loco pai‘entis"
to its students is a relatively new and Limited one: to this
day it. is confined pretty much to the Englishrspeakiug coun-
tries, and unknown elsewhere. The principle 01 “in loco
parenus" was doubtless suitable enough in an earlier era,
when boys went to college at the age of thirteen or fourteen;
if is a bit ridiculous in a society where most students are
mature enough to marry and raise families.”

We Suggest that the administration and faculty especially, take

a long hard look into the current trend oi administrative policy,
especially the educational implications oi the idea that students
should all accept a uniiorin “moral code ot behavior" which must

also be the administration's.

We suggest that die administration study the recommendations

set forth in the American Association of University Professors'
“Statement on the Academic Freedom of Students" (December 1965
AAUF Bulletin) which outline a just procedure for handling student
“violations"i

And this week Leggetl. observed: “There is a fundamental dis-
agreement With students on this matter of the moral question." We
agree. —n. w.

Supports Disseniers

To the Editor:

One of the arguments cur-
rcntly being used by students
who do not.wish to sign the
various statements expressing
reservations about the demon-
stration made by the Cofl-l'P
and the aws Board last week
is this: there is no need to ex-
press reservations since nothing
bad has happened.

1 think it should be pointed
out to these students that the
bad results of the demonstre.
tion are real and permanent
even though not immediately
visible. Prospective donors to
the College come, for the most
part, ti-om social and economic
classes who embrace a morality
opposed to such demonstrations.
The publicity attendant on the

and acting, as well as the di-
rection, are completely nunrpl'oA

With the mourning remem~

carried through a series at

around boui the girl and on

Finally the boy is delivered to

in which black and while are
reversed, works superbly to
embody the irashnass and
beauty of the inception at tho

tmm slipping into either insipid

fusion ls the Camera work. The
delicacy and precision of the
cimematography are in diam.
selves enough to recommend
the ﬁlm

port to the attempts of the

Executive Cabinet and Joint
House Presidents to respond

to it.

By “inconsistencies," Balikov
said he meant the punishment
or a social ottenss by academic
penalties. Speaking tor the reso
lution, he said, “Ever since I’ve
been here, the primary tactic
of the administration has been
to talk _ to talk and talk and
talk.” Only through action by
students, he said, has a par-
ticular Student issue been re<
Solved.

Speaking against the resolu-
tion, Sandy Hesselink said, “Too
many broad general conCEms
were involved in the protest.
The faculty and administration
is now aware of these concerns
and further action might an-
tagonize them and is unwar-
ranted.”

Most senators agreed that, in
light of a petition now circulat«
ing among the student body ex-
pressing rcservalion about the
action, the Senate should reaf-
tirm it by expressing iormal
approved-tent.

On a point of iniormation,
Bob Foote stated his belief that
any future illegal visitations ap<
prehended by student leaders
and taken to student court
would result in a serious Wam-
ing, For any illegal visitation
apprehended by the FSA Com-
mittee, he Said, “I wouldn't
want to be one of the students.

Aiicr the Senate passed the
resolution, Karen Lauterhacll
said she thought students in
the last few days had been
too preoccupied with the
propriety or impropriety of
the action, with repercus-
sions of the action, and were
forgetting about the purpose
or the protest. She said com-
munication between students
and faculty had never been a
problem in the aiiair and that
sud] communication had dou-
bled since the protest.

Before the resolution was in-
troduced, lion Johnston, retir—
ing social coordinator, gave a
few “tearsoakcd” comments of
rarewell. l-la encouraged the
new social coordinator to in-
troduce people to new ideas and
to new things. The budgeting of
entertainment, he said, should
be thought oi not only in terms
of cost but also in terms of
worth to the Student body, in
terms or campus reaction and
whether the event Will con-
tribute to the campus. Because
of the coordinator’s freedom
and budgetary control, Johnston
Said, the coordinator is in a
unique position to bring in out<
side people like Pike or Car-
michal to stir up the campus.
He urged that this and other in-
novations be enacted.

Carletonians Demand Resignations

A statement recently an
pcared in the Carleton College
student newspaper calling tor
the resignation of the college
president, the dean of women,
and the men's dean. The stato-
merit, written by Carleton Stu<
dent Association President Pete
Iverson a nd Men's League
PIESldent Bob Masur, resulted
in the administration's firing of
IversOn from his proctorship.

The Iversorbli’lasur statement

dents should have nothing to do -
with such a structure. We
cannot cooperate with a body

which we believe to be invalid."

Iverson was dismissed bcr

(Continued trom Page 1)

"asked by many students and
faculty members,"

More broadly the violation
was an expression of “com-
mittnient to the concept or
community not only in an
ideal sense but in a practical
sense.” Moreover, the viola-
tion was made necessary out
of a personal feeling on our
part that this decision (to sus-
pend three students) had
brought to our attention a
problem that needed immedi-
ate attention.” -

“Mainly what needs to be re-
emphasized," Miss Lauterbach
said, “is the committment to
the concept and process of com-
munity."

Foote opened his part of the
defense with an attempt to tell
"why I have ielt as strongly as
l have.”

Foote quoted two sections
from the college catalog. The
first was number seven of the
nine “objectives of the col-
lege”:

To help him acquire an
understanding of himself —
of his talenu, his limitations,
his needs, and his aspirations
—so that he may make wise
decisions regarding his voca»
tion, his choice or a mate, and
his way of Life.

“The whole process is an edu-
eative one,” Foote said. “The
Student makes mistakes and
the college should help without
terminating its relationship
with him.”

He then referred to the de-
lcriptiun of conduct probation
given in the catalog (pp. 55-56):

Conduct probation is a re-
cognition or general lack of
cooperation in citizenship, or
01 the breaking of some speci~
fic rule. The terms of this
probation are defined in each
case by the administrative ofr
ﬂcials imposing the probation
penalty.

This probation is a warn~
ing that severe discipline will

be imposed ii the strident on
probation is again reported
tor a similar lock oi coopera-
tion or tor violation at a so-
cial rule of the college.

in light oi this statement,
Foote called for a clariﬁcation
of the college’s disciplinary
policy.

Furthermore, Foote said, “I
think this case is an indicta-
tion that student government
as it now stands is ineffective
and has no purpose.“ Foote
said that in his four years at
Grinnell there had been no
progress toward any oi the
student’s goals for social
rules changes.
instead, the three factions,
administration, faculty and stu-
dents simply ‘butt their heads
together} “I don’t think I would
encourage anybody to spend
four years under it system like
this,” he said.

Specifically, Foote Called tor
changes in two critical areas,
the role at the Faculty Commit-
tee on Student Affairs and the
college’s counseling program.
he pointed to the dual role of
the Faculty Committee as both
a policy making and a judiciary
body. ‘If this Committee does
have two roles, diey should be
deﬁned," Foote said, and per~
haps twu committees are used
ed to replace the present one.

Both committees, Footo
said, should involve as voting
members all three [actions of
the community. “I think they

(the students) have a definite
right to be represented,"
Foote said.

“Students feel a very definite
concern,” Fnote continued, for

a “separate counseling system”
divorced from disciplinary
bodies. Presently, Foote said,
"Students may hesitate in get-
ing help irom the deans” be-
cause at the possibility oi disc
plinary action.

The possibility ot obtaining
these changes are, Footc said,

Need for Community Court Seen

By KRYS NEUMAN

The Student Court's decision
to issue a severe warning.
rather than a penalty, to the 19
house presidents who publicly
participated in illegal visita-
tions last week was characten
istic ot the change in emphasis
oi the Student Court this year.
The present court philosophy
stresses personal responsibility
rather than external punish-
ment.

Along with the change in phil-
osophy, Student Court members
had hoped to improve the en-
tire judicial system at Grinnell.
A community court system was
being discussed as a means of
solving the problem at commu«
nlcation breakdown between stu-
dents, taculty and administra-
tion over judicial issues.

The Men's and Women’s Pri-
mary Courts have already taken
a step in this direction by re-
cently combining efforts. Tim
Dailey, Chief Magistrate. re-
ports that the move has been
quite successful.

Since the breakdown in com-
munication alter the suspension
case, a committee has been ep<
pointed to structure a total com-
munity court.

in the meantime, the Student
Court plans to initiate a com—
munity court system on a trial
basis. “We will invite The Fac-

"The only reason i am staying
on in this system. There is
hope.”

After a brief questioning ses-
sion, the courts adjourned into
private session with the deans
and the faculty. The cotirts’
statement of their decision is
to the right.

Viet Speaker Coming

Slides and a lecture on Viet
Nam are slated for 8 pm. Wed-
nesday in the South Lounge of
the Forum. The speaker will be
Dr. Christopher Koch of Ben-
ningtcn College, pennington,
Vermont. A coitee hour, spon~
sored by IRC, will follow an in-
formal discussion.

ture, Dr. Koch toured North

thority to resist aggression in

ulty Committee on Student Ai-
lairs and the deans to our Court
when any signilicant case arises
that we are designated to han-
dle,” Said Bailey and the other
Chiei Magistrate. Linda Neal.
“We would hope to discuss cases
in community as we did on Sun-
day. The Court’s procedure is
to discuss a case, first of all
With the defendant himself. Di-
len the defendant is asked to
consider and suggest his own
penalty. Depending on the needs
oi the defendant, the Court may
act in an advisory, rather than
legislative capacity.

Under the present structure,
when The Committee and The
Deans sit in on a case there will
be unlimited discussion, but
only Student Cnurt members ac<
tually vote. This was true on
Sunday when the house presi-
dents’ case came before the
Court.

The two Magistrates iurther
Commented, “We would, in tact,
like to see on campus. all tur-
ther cases of rule infraction
handled by the discussion meth-
od."

Court Statement

We see the court not merely
as a body to mete out penalties.
Rather we see violations of col.
lege regulations as indicative of
contlict or tensions within the
environment. We then try to
respond to those contlicts with
appropriate solutions. it we feel
these solutions include tradi-
tional penalties, then penalties
are prescribed. it, however, we
feel the solution to a particular
coniiict does not reside in pen-
alty, we then seek an answer to
the problems raised by con»
suiting all or the members of
the community involved in the
specitic action.

The particular- occasion for
which we have met is the viola
tion of the visitation regula-
tion by to students on Wednes-
day, November 23, 1966 We
feel that there are tivo ways
in which to view the violation.
First, the action can be seen as
a protest, raising questions re
garding the speciﬁc decision of
suspension tor a previous case
of illegal visitation questions
involving the lack o clear com-
niunity policies regarding such
violations, the penalties imposed
tor such violations, and the ad-
ministration's position on ques-
tions oi premarital sexual rela-
tions. implicit in these prob
lems are additional questions
of the stildenls' role in deter-

mining these policies and par-
tiCipating in those decisions,

To these goals at which the
protest was aimed, the court
can only agree.

They are valid and in need
of imnlctliute attention. How-
ever, given the contusion
which rcsullietl from much
broader concerns being at-
tached to the speciﬁc issue
being protested, the unfortun-
ate misinterpretatinns that
have bocn made by various
elements of the community
regarding the purpose ot the
actions, and the personal 11':-
pcrcussiuns that have ensued,
We would deeply question the
method used to bring these
issues forcefully to the com-
muity’s attention. The court
cannot convey the p o i n t
strongly enough that further
actions of this nature at this
time by any group would be
viewed by us as superfluous
and hence irresponsible con-
duct on the part of those iii-
volved.

Whatever the method, sig-
nificant problems hate been
raised. Because these problems
were seen as total community
concerns and because of our
philosophy of consulting Ill in-
volved parties, illl elements or
the Community were invited to
participate in the discussions
attempting to find the appropri-
ate solutions. The faculty was
represented by its chairman,
Mr. Wall, and the Faculty Come
mittee on Student Affairs; the
administration by the student
deans; and the students by the
A,W.S. Board, the Council of
House President, the executive
cabinet and the Primary Court.

Out of this discussion cams

representing all elements of the
community in decisions to be
implemented. A mechanism tor
continuing discussion on ques-
tions that could not be suffi-
ciently discussed (luring the
first meeting was of primary
concern to the court and the
mechanism has been established.

The second Way in which the
action in question can be Viewed
is as an ordinary student Viola-
tion of a college regulation.
One of the recognized aims of
this college is to Encourage per-
sonal decision and confronta»
tion with one’s environment
during the four-year educational
process. In line with this aim,
the court seeks to give suflici—
ent opportunity for this self-
examination. A first violation
of a college regulation is an
opportunity for a student viola-
tor to be made fully aware of
his existence in b larger enr
Vironment and the requirement
placed upon him to live within
that trameuork. A proper Court
response then should be a War
ing, to give the student an op.
portunity tor a period of Sci!-
appraisal. Theretore, the court’s
policy has been that in most
cases of first offense. 3 Serious
warning is issued to the Student
violator that additional viola-
tions may result in more serious
penalties such as conduct pro-
bution or suspension.

LeMoyne Program Needs Overhaul

By KRYS NEUMAN

Ed. Note: The following
article about the LeMoyne—
Grinneii exchange program is
based on a questionnaire
sent to students who have
participated in the program
and those iacnlty and adminis-
tration members who have
been in some way involved
wilh it.

Last Week the 5&3 printed
the first part ot the article
which dealt with criteria for
selectlng a good exchange
student.

Although LeMoyne College re—
spondents drew a picture of the
ideal exchange student similar
[0 that oi crinnellions, some of
them were quite openly critical
or previous Grinnell representa-
lives on the exchange.

LeMoyne faculty would re-
quire a student to be first and
loremost “open, honest and
direct" In manner and motia
vated primarily by the sincere
desire to understand and con-
tribute to a different environ-
ment. One participant required
that exchange students from
both schools “restrain their
parochialism and pride."

The tendency toward coit-
structive community involve—
ment was emphasized in the
choosing of applicants, far
and above the consideration
of grades. “Students should be
selected for the program who
have indicated in past actions
(not 1qu in writing) that they
can participate constructive-
ly in community pursuits.
This criterion should not be
come a means of rejecting
students whose action has of-
tended some members of the
college but it sho‘uld he used
to eliminate any applicants
who have little or no actual
experience in communal ac-
“on.”

Another response called for
the Student who would “get
something started” and sug-
gested possibilities "n musici—
an,_ actor, political activist,
photographer, club organizer,
journalist or unorthodox thinks
er.” A third response listed
ways in which Grinnell students
had already contributed effec-
tively on a "give-and-taxe in-

volvement” in academics too,
noting that there has been
"conspicuously less success in
this area." in fact. it was re—

ported that some Grinnell stu-
dents lnsulted LeMoyne by the
condescending attitude that they
displayed toward Classwol’k and
even toward other students at
LcMoyne.

This particular response went
on to say that a cooperative at<
titude in the classroom was pal"
ticularly important at the pres-
ent time since LeMoyne stu-
dents. in increasing numbers,
are striving toward acceptance
at Northern graduate schools
where much competition will be
in the form of Northern white
students. Grinnell students —-
Vain or otherwise — nuw rep-
resent the measure of competi-
tion.

“The Grinnell representative
to Leivloyne must be a good
student, but the kind ui good
student who is able to share
knowledge rather than pontiii-
cafe on it."

The answers of the Leiloyne
faculty to the questionnaire
pointed out that Grinnell stu-
dents should be prepared for
the fact that they affect the en-
tire Leivloyne community even
by their unintentional actions
it was reported, tor instance,
that previous exchange students
seriously decreased the quality
oi academic life at LeMoyne
by effecting a too great in-
crease in the social life.

Further, instead of chang-
ing stereotype race concepts
about white students they re-
portedly reintorced them (al-
though only among those who
did not know them personal-
ly). “For example, it was
quite widely believed, espe-
cially among women students,
that Grinnell students came
to LeMoyne lor one reason,
sex; or, by those more in-
clined to be charitable, for a
good time; and/or because
they were looking for an easy
academic load (this last View
was contirmed by some crin-
nellians themselves)"

Both LeMoyne and Grinnell
participants in the survey sug~
gested expansion of the pros
gram beyond the basis of the
present student exchange.

They all reacted enthusiastic-
ally to the idea oi faculty ex-
changes, although only one pro
fessor has participated in such
an exchange since [he incep-
tion or the program several
years ago ‘The Leivloyne-Grin-
nell exchange was originally
seen as a studentrfaculty pro

gram for which it was assumed
[here would he a Substantial
interest," said Registrar Dale
Terry who is the former ad-
ministrator of the program at
Grinnell. The present admin'
trator of the program here,
Richard H. Winters (Associate
Dean of the College) now com-
plains about insuiiicient appli-
cants.

Ned Donuhoe (theater) is
the one proiessor who has
participated in the exchange.
(He is now on a leave of ab-
sence to San Francisco State
College in California). “Dona.
hoe‘s visit was a great boon
to the drama program at Le-
Moyne as well as a great
stimulation to the campus in
general and a wonderiul ex-
perience inr Donahoe him-
seli. i think more opportunity
should be made available for
this type or program it it is
a desire on the part oi the
faculty,” Wrote one of the ex-
change students.

Faculty exchanges were men-
tioned as a means of strength-
ening specific departments and

of providing courses that could
not otherwise be offered. One
exchange student used the ex-
amples of art and psychology
at LeMoyne; these are not yet
major iields of study there and
could easily use an added boost.

Joseph a. Wall, Chairman of
the Faculty at Grinnell, noted

 

LeMOVNE COLLEGE i! concentrated in
aeveral blocks, isolated romewhst from
the surrounding city. but adiaeant to the
predominantly lower»clasa

campus it a

that his own department (his-
tory), for example, would bene-
fit by a special seminar on the
LeMoyne course “Civil War and
Reconstniction."

Wall was or the opinion that
the exchange program has been
“too much for the individual
and not for the community” and
that “Grinnell has not taken as
great advantage of the program
as has LeMoyne.” He felt that
faculty exchanges would more
eitectiveiy serve the entire
community.

Wall pointed out the reason
[or hesltnncy of Grinnell fac-
ulty in the past and a likely
solution: “There has to be
general agreement that a fac-
ulty exchange to LeMoyne
does not irnpiy giving up a
leave of absence or affect a
sabbatical leave —- being part
of the LeMoyne community is
still being part of Grinnell’st"

Commenting on the total pro-
gram Well said: “We haven’t
begun to touch the question of
exchanges. Maybe we have
been too formal in our think»
lng, not experimental enoughl"
Certainly the questionnaire re-
spondents had a wide variety of
ideas of an experimental nature.
Telephonic lectures were sug—
gested along with visiting lec-
tureships. o ther suggestions
were the trading of art exhibits
and basketball teams and re-
ciprocal visits to special events
and conferences, such as “The
Grinnell Weekend." One parti —
pant thought communication
would be greatly improved by
exchange columns in the school
newspapers.

“The most creative and in-
terest-arousing Grimlell et-
lorts on the LeMoyne campus
were the production of Sar-
tre‘s The Flies, supervised by
Mr. Donahue but acted by
LeMoyme students, and Rev-
erend Dewey’s talk on exis-
tentialism and three-hour long
discussion with interested stu-
dents. The exportation of in-
dividual singers and jazz
groups from LeMoy to
Grinnell has good possib es,
as do sports team exchanges.
Lectures alone don’t hold
much interest (for one thing,
the contact is too transitory
to be very elfective)."

Many questionnaire partici»
pants were excited about the
visit to LeMoyne by Grinnell’s
student drama production of
“Slow Dance on the Killing
Gruund‘K But finding financial
support for this production was

hauling area, The Grinnell student going

a great difficulty of the produc-
tion staff. The theater depart-
ment has no funds allotted for
road tours and the budget for
the LeMoyne program makes no
allowance for such special proj-
eels.

The questionnaires brought
out the fact that there is a lack
of available funds for experi-
mental exchanges between Le-
Moyne and Grinnell and, in fact,
student exchanges anywhere.
James H. Stauss, Dean of the
College, said that if such pro-
grams are to be instituted soon,
recommendations must be sub-
mitted to the 1967158 budget.

Both Grinnell and LeMoyno
participants expressed the de-,
sire to continue reciprocal
programs but agreed that ma-
jor changes are needed.

A LeMoyne professor sug-
gested that an orientation pro-
gram "should give the students
an informed awareness of the
novel aspects of the commu»
nity they will be entering, so
that they will be able to dis-
tinguish between ‘special reac-
tions‘ and 'personal reactions’,
both in themselves and in oth-
ers." The example given was
that of the hostility with which
students were forced to deal
when four Grinnell women en-
tered the LeMoyne environ-
ment, creating a greater imbal-
ance to the already predomi-
nantly female environment.

Many participants complained
about the lack of knowledge at
Grinnell about the exchange
program and the subsequent
lack of enthusiasm. The sugs
gestion was made that the col-
lege inform students sooner and
more thoroughly about the pro-
grams Some felt that a variety
oi limited exchange programs
would increase applications tor
the full semester at LeMoyne.
Others Said that a better organ-
ized welcoming program for Le-
Moyne students and iollownp
program for returning Grinnell
students was a necessity. Slides
or motion pictures were sug-
gested for the followup coffee-
hour.

Finally, some questionnaires
stressed a need for expansion
at the program into two semes-
ters. Some LeMoyne faculty ielt
the interruption of a full se<
mester to be very detrimental,
The suggestion was made that,
during times when LeMoyne is
overcrowded, Grinnell Students
could still participate in the ex-
change as housing could be
found for them in town.

Smylie also said the 1966 elec-

solidate the gains which the na-
tion has made and pericct the
administrative techniques by
which those gains will be pre-
served.

Because of the lack of indi-
v‘d 1, local, and state respon-
s ty, Smylie said, there has
been a great administrative
shift to the lederal government
tor solving social problems The
elecliun shows, however, that
“the American people are will<
ing to measure up to the re
sponsibility at doing things ror
themselves.” Rejecting the
view that states are archaic, he
said, “the preservation of that
system or checks and balances
between hometown and national
capital is ﬁnally and under-
standably important to the
preservation of individual hu-
man rights.”

"The existing areas oi po<
litical aciion,” Smylie said,
“with great new opportunities
ior boldness and creativity
and innovation, will be found
more and more at the state
level. The question heiore us
is whether or not stale and
local governments can keep
abreast of the changing times
and take Ihe lead in solving
these problems.”

That the states have not done
so in the past, Smylie said, is
partly because of malappor-
.ioned legislatures, a problem
idat is currently being solved
.n the courts. it is also because
or the state's inabi 'ty to raise

revenue. The expenditures of
state and local government, he
said, were six tima greater in
’65 Lhan in '47, but the inability
to raise the required revenue
has created a squeeze Federal
grants in aid have too oiten
wasted money on outdated op-
erations. Smylie hoped that the
problem would be solved by a
plan to tunnel iederal iunds in-
to the states With no strings al-
iached.

Finally, Smylie hoped tor the
Republican party to revitalize
the federal system. He warned
the party not “to interpret the
election as a mandate to turn
backward . . . The Republican
opportunity now is to seize the
initiative in structural political
thinking and build a positive
image of periormance {or the
party.

"The election was very ob<
viously an endorsement of a
greater and more positive role
ior stats and local governments
and for private enterprise in
combating the country’s ills."

“Under present policies or the
Board of Publications (corrr
posed oi live faculty and tour

York Steiner, Chairman) I find
it impossible to iulilll both my
responsibilities as an editor and
as a student.” Morton said she
had been working on getting
some sort of a system of in—
dependent academic credit set
up that could work in cunjllnc~
tion with the yearbook editor-
ship so as to reduce the numv
her of courses she would have
to take while working on the
book. She told the 58d}: “1
brought the subject up (at the
Board meeting) about a month
ago, but Steiner tabled it until
a committee could he formed
to study the problem (a com-
mittee has not yet been estab-
lished). if a system were to be
instituted i might consider tak-
ing the job on again.”

Morton commented that “The

To the Editor:

Last year i spent my junior
year abroad studying in an

nglish university and since my
return i have maintained a
correspondence with many oi
the iriends that 1 made, both
students and iacnlty. Today I
was thinking how 1 could possia
bly explain to them the rsti n.
ale employed in the suspending
oi three students for “illegal
visitation" or the action that
the Coin? and AWS Boards
were iorccd to take.

1 decided that my task was
an impossible one, since the
rules at the university i at
tended were conspicuous only
by their absence. it is my lirm
heliel that this is the most
successiul system for o coni-
miiiiily oi the Grinnell type to
emulate (i. c, ii it must emur
late and not lead). with a one
hesive community oi our type
the sole ‘rulc’ that must be
kept in mind is that one in-
dividual has no right to in-

ft
that money will be reiunded to
those who have bought subscrip-
tions to the cook. The other ﬁ-
nancial losses incurred this year
will be coveied by a “sinking
iund” made up oi previous
yearbooks’ profits and by the lst
semester contribution from
SGA. Any losses that remain
will be covered by profits from
the ’66 yearbook alter it is is-
suedi Sales for the ’65 yearbook
will be reopened in January's
The Board also approved
Suzanne Gelber as editor of the
5&3 tor the term beginning
next semester. Ameil Fisher
also applied for editor. Henry
Wilhelm, who had previously
applied [or the 5&8 editorship,
was judged “acceptable” by the
Board but was not approved
because oi a ruling or “aca»
demic ineligibility” by Tile Com—
mittee on Academic Standing.
Gelher told the Board she
wants to make the 58:3 “more
oi a journal” with an increase
or “in-depth“ reporting. Slie air
so plans to reorganize the staii
to Create a wider distribution at

The role punishment that t a

when an individual is negligent
in respecting the basic rights
or another.

it seems to me that under
this basic type oi system no
restrictions can be justiiied on
such things as women’s hours,
visitation, etc Restrictions such
as these indicate that the col-

able at regulating their own
lives. This is t talse presump-

chaos nor to anarchy.

What 1 am advocating should
not be constmed as complete
indiiierences by the college to
the nonacademic weliare of the
student. on the contrary, I
think that the college has a
very valid role to play here,
but it is a role that the col-
lege has been lax in periorming.
The college should oiler moral

I believe that the student

but as mature, intelligent indi-

delves into matters that ariect

Pioneer Swim Team Will Open Season at Knox

The Pioneer varsity swim-
mlng team will open the sea-
lon tomorrow at the Knox Re-
lays with almost double the
number of team members it
had last year, This year rookio
coach Roy Obermiller will be
able to count on a ”large"
squad of thirteen members that
will surely give the Pioneers
more strength.

of the thirteen, Obermiller
has four that have prDVEd their
ability already. Another two
have had varsity experience
while the other seven will be
new to the varsity

Ken Adelman will be the
leader of the six returnees. An
excellent butterfly specialist, he
holds all the school records and
was second in the conference

last year after setting a con-
lerence record in the prelimi-
naries.

Steve Holtze, Hill Lontz, and
Rich Lance are other veterans.
All have the ability to be con»
sisLerlt winners for the Pioneers
this yeari Lontz specializes in
the sprints and ﬁnished second
in the conference in the 60-yard
freestyle two years ago Holtze
specializes in the individual
medley and holds the school
record in it. He finished fourth
in the conference last year.
Lance missed last year as he
spent a semester at LeMoyne
but had a successful sophomore
year as a diver, finishing ﬁfth
in the conference.

Other holdovers are Bob Wells

ly, Leggett said: “The only pos-
SIblo alternative would be to let
them come back under conduct
probation, My notion is that
conduct probation wasn't severe
enough in this case, This (Con-
duct probation) would indicate
that the college took on indif-
ferent attitude toward this sort
of behavior (students spending
the night together) and I did
not want to give students or
parents this idea. And (their)
being away does serve as
a reminder (to those still on

were guilly of misbehavior.”
Leggelt went on to say, "On
this matter of illegal visitation

just don’t have an open mind

Cagers Begin Season Against Luther

The Pioneer basketball team
will be relying on improved
speed, shooting, and depth
when they begin their season
tomorrow night at 7:30 against
Luther in Darby.

Coach Pfitsch this year has
ten players who he thinks will
be able to play a great deal. on
his current first team he lists
three sophomores, one junior,
and one senior, With a team of
four juniors and a senior back»
ing them up.

Expected to be in the starting
lineup tomorrow are Henry
Wingate and Mike Schwartz at
guards, Elliott Hibbs and Thor
Evenson at forwards, and Sam

Coach Pfltsch mentioned his
first team is very quick and all
five members are good jumpers
although they are small, “This
team plays best when they are
pressing full-court all the time,
but when they start to set up
the offense they do not pro-
duce as Well.”

doesn‘t stand for premarital

that we are a small middle-

ample"

Leggett commented that he
would like to see greater flex-
ibility in the rule structure: “ll-
legal visitation is a matter of
degrees—a young lady sitting
in a man’s room until 8:00 RM,
is different than overnight. I
don't think our present rule sys-

The Pioneer front line with
its quickness and jumping abili-
ty will probably be able to cov.
er the big men of the other
team better than in the two
previous years. '

They will have a chance to
see how they can cover big men
as Luther comes here. Ptltsch
thinks this will be the best
team the Pioneers will face this
year. Luther is big and last and
has many returnees from the
team that humbled the Pio-
neers at Luther last year.
