On Fifth Year Program

Grinnellian Reports from Thailand

Ed. Note: The lollowlng re-
port is by Ginny Harford,
’65, who is presently teaching
English in Chiengmal, Than
land. she is a participant In
the Grlnneil fifth-year abroad
program.

I guess first in better throw
in some of the facts about my
job~hern which i found rather
inaccessible when trying to dis-
cover what the program in-
Volved.

As i am doing. most of tho
Grinnellians who come to Thai-
land with the Fifth Year
Abroad Program have taught in
Chiengmai, This is the second
(but by fat the second) largest
city in Thailand and is about
sou miles north of Bangkok.
Some of us have taught at
Prince Royal's College (primar-
ily a boys’ school except lor the
last two years of high school)
and some have taught here at
Dara Academy (girls' school).
Both of these schools include
students from kindergarten age
through high school. Dara has
about 1,700 students. About 90
of these girls live on campus
in a dorm.

Both Prince Royal's and Dara
are mission schools — original»
1y begun by the Presbyterians
but now under the Church of
Christ in Thailand. This natu-
rally puts us closer to the Amer-
ican religious society here than
to the American military society
(which is increasing rapidly).
But there is not a great pres-
sure toward nny kind of reli-
gious activity although I can
imagine that someone who ac-
tively and loudly disagrees
with the Christian religion
would find it difficult to Work
within the framework of the
school.

what I am trying to say is
that there has been trouble I.“
the past with the religious con-
victions (or lack of) of some
Grinnell volunteers. Many or
the restrictions (such as re-
quired chapel) have not been
lifted, but anyone who comes
must be aware that to work
with people most cirectively
in lhis framework, there will
have to he at least a toler-
ance of such things as pray-
ers at teachers' meeting, etc.
Beyond that nothing is re.
quired.

As a Grinneil volunteer you
would probably live on campus,
either in a house with other
Thai teachers or perhaps in the.
dorm with teachers and stu4
dents. i am living in a room
above the'l-iome Ec room. 0n
the same floor are about four
other Thai teachers, Darlene
Keeier, another Grinnellian, and
assorted others. The room re-
minds me very much of a room
I had at camp oncer So, come
with the idea that you won’t
be living in luxury out not with
the idea that you will be living
in the wilds of the jungle — as
I admit I had pictured at
times. Meals can be either Thai
or foreign — both of which are
provided at the school. The
Thai food is prepared in the
norm, the foreign food at the
home oi a missionary who lives
on campus.

I am teaching English only 14
hours a week (15 is the normal
load) but will be teaching 18
hours when Dar leaves in No
vember. I teach the best Eng-
lish sections in the 10th, 11th.

SCARLET AND BLACK

 

Editorial .

Last week’s editorial pointed to the need for a "con-
text of understanding” on the part of the alumni and par-
ents toward the Grinnell educational experience.

One means of providing such a context is wholly
lacking: that is a high quality periodical alumni publica-
tion which acts as more than a class newsletter.

The present Alumni Scarlet and Black needs to
be scrapped in favor of a publication, preferably a
“slick" lei-monthly, which would offer not only alumni
news but would tell in words and pictures something
about the ongoing changes in Grinnell life.

Articles by faculty about their own research and
work as well as articles about all phases of student life
would be appropriate for inclusion.

Must colleges of Grinuell’s stature have such a pull-
lication, though hopefully Grinnell could improve on the
quality of the vast majority of these.

The need for such a publication seems apparent to
the administration, but shortages of money and time
have so far held up concrete steps toward its realization.
From this viewpoint it looks as though we’ve stalled long
enough. As each issue of the AS&B loses itself in innocu<
ous announcements, another opportunity is lost for im-
proving the “context of understanding” and consequently
the college‘s support in the outside world.

Train
To the Editor:

Homecoming visitors and stu-

dents were treated to an unex-
pected thrill last Saturday when
their attention was grasped by
a train passing north to south
just east or Ward Field.
_ Spectators enjoyed views of
natcars, oil cars and several
boxears hearing such rnottns as
“Railway Express," “Go Great
Northern” and other similar
inspirational messages.

The train was reported to
have contained more than one

Hovering Skephcrsm
To the Editor:

Skepticism seems to hover in
the air of this campus, especial-
ly concerning unrestricted wo<
men’s hours. Snickers about
"discussions" at a quarter to
twelve tend to have a sarcastic,
1 - know . what - you - really »
mean flavor to them. But allow
me to relate an event which no-
tually took place this last Sun-
day night:

’1\vo close friends of mine
were talking on the phone at
11:45 pm. So far, so good. But
tragedy creeps into the drama.
tic situation: one iriend lives
on North Campus, the other on
South. AS the conversation pro-
ceeds, past midnight, past the
hewitching hour when all Cin-
derellas are turned into King
Kongs — to be locked up, she
learns that he is deeply upset
and wants to talk to her about
it. Well, they’re on the phone,
right? And everybody and his
cousin George can walk by and
talk to them, ask them to keep
their voices down 7 it’s quiet
hours, you know — or to get off
the phone, they’re expecting a
call. So what do you do’! He
could meet her at one or the
court yards and pretend he was
the pizza man until the night
watchman came along — per-
haps luteen minutes. but not
long enough to handle a prob-
em.

So what do you do at a time
like this? The opportunity to
help someone has arisen, Not a
Des Moiues project, not a Bel—
mond project. This is someone
you kuowl Someone in whom
you have a vested interest. You
could help him, talk to him, lis-
ten, understand, empathize . . .
if only you could be with him,
Is this such a crime? Problems
don’t run on a schedule coinci-
dent with the Cinderella hours.

louder and Funnier

By JAMES KISSANE, English

Three Ugly Years, by L. K.
Hanson.

Like most Grimellians who
never checked it with Protes-
sor Erickson, l have always re—
garded St. Olaf as the braided
and buxom Nordic Frau among
our sister colleges, high—minded
enough tor anything but like as
not a touch on the stodgy side.
So I was surprised and envious
to discover that Notthiield’s
other campus has spawned a
really iirstrate piece of college
humor.

I can understand that on this
particular subject no one is in a
hurry tn take a college protes-
sor’s word for it. and I felt the
same way when as dean of men
(of all people) touted me on to
this collection of campus car-
toons. But Thompson was right;
Three Ugly Years, by 1.. K.
Hanson, for three years the
stair cartoonist on the St. Olaf
student newspaper, captures in
its “Wiggly lines and squiggly
letters" a very funny and gen-
uinely distinctive glimpse oi the
college scene.

During his ugly years at Olaf,
Hanson must have made that
taculty forget all about tally-
ing up the misspellings, gram-
matical atromties, and offenses
against logic and human decerb
cy that appeared in the college
paper. The “Uglies.” as the
comic strips collected in the
book are called, run the full
gamut of campus situations -—
from the frustrations of peace

marchers to the ignominy of
clean sneakers and Lhe living
death of the Studentrlaculty cof-
tee hour — without striking a
Single false note. Even the refs
erellces to purely local preoc-
cupations only heighten the
authenticity and bite of Han-
son’s comic portrayal. It is the
drawing, however, that makes
the cleverness and the ac-
curacy oi the “Uglies” jell into
a grand piece of campus satire.
Hanson’s pictures are about as
primitive as Virgil Partch’s or
Jules Feiffer’s, and his att' ~
tic unskill is even more at a Vir-
tue than theirs. These sublimely
awiul drawings are the perfect
vehicle for expressing the
grubby and extravagant disen-
chautment that makes the
"Uglies" so enchxnu'rlg.
Hanson's cartoons don’t give,
it hardly need be said, a public
relations man‘s view or college
llfe: but somebody at St. Olaf
knew what he was doing to see
to it that so iresh and zany a
manifestation of irreverence and
wit was called to people‘s at:
tention. Some years ago a stu-
dent Showed me what purported
to be a reproduction of Alan
Jones' blackboard illustrations
through an entire hisoory
course, accompanied by appro-
priately bewildering captions.
I thought they were terribly fun-
ny, and if someone had printed
them up as a hook, Grinnell
might have stolen a march on
St. Olal’s Three llgly Years.
And this takes me to Lha

question why current efforts at
humor on our campus should
be so consistently feeble or
gauche and why student criti-
cism should be so lacking in the
comic spirit. Maybe I just don’t
see the good stun people turn
out, but examples or the oppo-
Slte kind are not far to seek.
One would get the impression
from last week’s 5&3, tor in-
stance, that our idea oi kicks
here is to zap classics protes-
sols and to ilail away at tradi-
tional and largely moribund at-
titudes tow a rd Homecoming
with a sarcasm so inert and
heavy handed as to make the
proverbial lead balloon seem
like Halley’s Comet by Com-
parison. I believe it Was John
Dryden who said that a sloven-
ly butchering is a poor excuse
for satire. What one admires
especially about Hanson‘s “Ugo
lies” is that they do the job‘
with a ﬂair. Paradoxically,
think “urbanity” would have to
be the word for the quality that
comes through the spectacular
crudeness or the "Uglies"; and
that is exactly what one misses
in the irritable, joyless carping
that seems our style.

'ntree Ugly Years convinces
me that St. Olaf must have
more going for it than its own
herd of mllch cows and some
mighty fine hymn singers. As
for Grinnell, I have not lost
hope that its student culture
will some day serve up some-
thing a bit more piquant than
unadulterated animus and uhr
leavened angst.

 

twelve and on again at logsin
opening the following morning.
You can’t pretend that people
stop thinking, feeling, crying,
laughing alter twelve, as if they
were mar-ionettes set aside. Yes,
Women can Visit between their
own halls, as can men. But what
happens when the person(s)
closest to you live on the other
side of the tracks?

A college should give its stu-
dents the opportunity to experi-
ment, to make mistakes in a spe~
cial environment, less harsh
and severe, but equally as real
as that of the unsheltered
world. Now, while you are
somewhat isolated from the city
police, the church, your par.
ents, you can develop your-
self, see what you are really
like inside. Try things —— try to
console a heartbroken friend a
TRY, you may fail, but what do
you gain it you don’t make the
chart? But you’d better watch
out — you might learn some-
thing. Live and learn; learn and
live. Watch your step, please.

Discussions are being held at
Beloil: concerning the role
of the college in the life
oi a student. Symposiums,
called “convo clusters," have
been held entitled “The College
as a Community." Beloit has
concentrated on trying to bring
student and faculty groups
closer togeuier.

Controversy has also arisen
over the issue of whether or not
Beloit should call itself a
Christian institution. No deii<
nite concepLs have been estab-
lished yet, but three proposals
have received more support ac-
cording to the Christian College
Committee One plan gives
complete freedom at thought,
one accepts Christianity as an
important part of its heritage
and the third plan combine:
these two Views. Under the
third plan Beioit would tenta-

Provided there are no diffi-

for an across—the-board pay

Muzolini said, “is desperately

Robert W. McMillan, art, direc-
tor oi the gallery.

The prints display the health
or a Polish tradition in graphie
expression that arose from the
early 20th-century European re-
surgence oi printmaking. rho
posters, by leading Polish prac-
titioners of an art form utilized
tor more commercial objectives
in Western Europe and Amer-
ica, are bold, assertive, and
gay, lunctioning like decorative
banners.

“Evidence of a continuing ei-
liance with Western European
thought and reeling could not

McMillan stated.

The exhibition, which was ses
cured through the Smithsonian
Institution In Washington, D.C.,‘
will continue through Nov. 9.

Even When She Answers, He Still Gets the Busy Signal.

DEAR REE:

lately, every time i call my girl, she's either ”not in" or "not inter-
ested." Last week I called her 23iimes and couldn't even make a
coﬂee dale. The trouble started when she started dating a guy
who owns a Dodge Coronet. Now she goes to parties with him,
dances, football games, etc. Do you think i should call her again,
or should i iorgei her and break her heart?
BAD CONNECTIONS

DEAR BAD CONNECTIONS:
lihink your next call should be to your Dodge Dealer. Then make
a date to see the '67 Coronet, the cor that's breaking heoris all
over America. You‘ll find that its good looks are pretty hard to
resist. Now, beiore you break your girl's heart, give her another
break. Ask her to go for t: ride in your new Coronet. i think she'll

growl‘l'ze,

get the signal.

 

 

Here's the heuribreoker . . .'67 Dodge Coronet 500. A campus iavoriie with its great new looks, ride,
and list oi extras that are standard. Like bucket seats with either a companion seat in the middle or a
center console. Plush carpeting, Padded instrument panel. Padded sun visors. Sect bells, iront and
rear. A choice at Six or V8 models. And lots more. So get With '67 Dodge Coronet and get busy.

By ELLIOTT HIBBS

Football is over and the
bruises are healed and what
came 01 it? A repeat champion
Dibble. Dibble lost to East Nor-
ris in their third game but went
undefeated the rest of the way.

Gates also came on strong at
the end or the year and tnplr
sole possession or second place.
Smith and Clark tied for third
and East rounded out the tOlJ
spots in him place

North’s strong tennis team
easily won that trophy. East
and Smith were tied tor a dis-
tant secondl South was fourth
and Clark edged Dibble and
Rawson for the fifth spoil

Dibble leads in the Truesdale
Trophy race due to a pair of
innovations put into the I.M.

years Ten points are given to
each ball for every man that
hall has participating in on in-
tercollegiate sporL Dibble col-
lected 150 polnts irom this sys~
18111.

An innovation this year is
that a hall loses ten points if
their referee does not show up
to a game he is assigned to.
Dibble was the only hall not to
lose points. Clark lost or) points
and dropped from third to
fourth in Truesdale standings.

These new innovations are
good. Yet» as far as I can tell
they have not been voted upon
by the 1M. chairmen. and is
it not here that all new inno-
vations should be discussed and
voted on? It is my feeling that
the l.M. chairmen should be
the only ones to change any
part or the intramural system.
All recent changes have come
from Mr. Plitsch’s office or
irom the halls' representative.

Their pass ptiense is strong
though and the Pioneers will
have to improve their defense
against it if they hope to win.

Coach Bowers noted that
Lawrence has its strongest
team in many years and the
Pioneers will need a near per—
lect game to beat them. Last

week the Vikings only lost to
Ripon 1&7 when the Redmen
scored a touchdown in the last
quarter. Besides that their rec-

Leading the Vikings is their

ing he also paces them in rush-
ing and is the punter. He also
leads the league in scoring with

The Lawrence defense» which
held the league’s top offensive

will also be tough for the Pio-
