Senators for the 1970-71 academic
year. In addition, 479 of those stu~
dents volcddn favor of the estah~

Academic Affairs Committee.
There were 177 abstentioos, and
only 101 students voted against
the proposal.

Eight ot tlte Senators etnerged
lrom Monday's balloting. but a
rtinott was necessary to till the
last two seats. Alan Cohen, Kit
Gage, Ida Gudema, Erie Jahn,
Bill Killpati‘iek, Laurie Levatin,
John Onslad. and Barry Zigas
were llle firSI~rnund winners. and
Mike Breed and Golda Dwass
defealed Mark Allen for the final

Two interesting laets emerged
from tlle results of the election,

&G Goes Out On Strike

Beginning Monday morning
the Grinllell College Build-

went on strike against the Col-
lege. The 5&3 has interviewed
a number of B&G workers to
discover their reasons (or

we heard centered around the
policies and personality oi
Dale Hawn, Director of the
Physical Plant.

cases, workers interviewed said
they would rather not be dis

The greatest single concern
of the workers interviewed ap-
peared to be job security.
Many men asserted that Mr.
l-lawn hires and fires men, not
according to qualifications or
seniority, but according to
whether they are his friends
or not. For example, one man
was allegedly ﬁred recently

The Buildings and Grounds workers have gone
on sti'i c. The Tcamsters’ Union and the College
have been unable to agree on a contract for these
employees. The College argues that its proposal is
lair within the bounds of its financial resources and
the current labor market. The Union argues that the
College can allol'd more and that the employees de-
serve more money and benefits. Student and fac-
ulty support for the strike has ranged from benign
sympathy to active participation in picketing and,
in several instances, to boycotting of classes.

The matters of the College’s financial resources
and financial commitments are complex ones. No
one, we believe, can make a decision on the justncss
of the position of either side without a thorough
examination of these. This week we have attended
both student and faculty meetings at which the
question of the strike was considered. It is pain-
fully obvious that a number of people are perfectly
willing to support the Buildings and Grounds work-
ers with little or no knowledge of the facts. At
neither of these meetings was the possibility serious-
ly considered that the Union is making unjust and
unreasonable demands. This is surely an example
of a degenerate kind of liberalism. It is compassion

without thought.

We do not categorically support either the Col-
lege or the Union in this matter. By the time this
editorial appears, some settlement may be reached.
We believe, however, activists to the contrary not-
withstanding, that the proper position for students
and faculty to take is one of respectful silence. As
for those faculty members who have refused to hold
Classes in support of the strike, we accuse them of
intolerable professional incompetence. A riLuTiber of
students and faculty have shown that their capacity
for righteous indignation far exceeds their desire

for reasoned action.

New Senate Calls Self
'The Student Vanguard"

by Toni th-contieiit

The New Senate. consisting
mostly of nervous ircshmeii and
jaded sophomores, was
predictably siiy and coiitrite at
the opening of their first meeting
Aiter two hours had elapsed.
however, the Senators realized
tiiat iiiey had not only shot one
whole evening down the tubes,
but also missed a Humphrey
Bogart ilick on TV
t“CaSablanca" constars
Claude Raiiies and Ingrid
Bergman) By two, they were
visibly irritated The color had
drained out oi Kit Cage's com-
plexion, Bill Kilpatrick was
suffering writer’s cramp, and
Golda Mass was on the verge
of collapse from underexcite-
inent. At the risk of appearing
to be under the sponsorship of
one of our rival publications 1
can only say: “Free the Student
Senate."

Mary Brooner brought up the
subject of proposed eon
educational iiall changes. Mary
said that one program called for
educational living by rooms.
tTiiis shall be known as the Loose
proposal.) There is also another
proposal in exislance which
suggests coeducational living by
floors. tThis shall be known as
the NotrSonLoose proposal 1

Mary then coniirmed the
rumor that the studentrwide
questionnaire on hetero»~ual
living was poorly administered
and. lurihermore, the
questionaire that had been
returned had not been tabulated,

The Senate moved to make a
resolution in iavor of the Loose
proposal John Onstead cons
tended that the Senate should not
make such a proposal now.
because tiic untabulated
questionnaires were meant to
assess tiic student's opinion on
the subject, John was countered
by AI Cohen. “That doesn't
matter We're not representing
anything " Amen,

Belorc the gathered throng
launched a discussion on the B&G
strike, Greg Vraniear bestowed
a new epithet upon the Senate

MikePenziier rose to say that
the Vanguard of Student Opinion
had asked for donations to a
strike fund and no one was giving
any money. A] Cohen rose to say
that the Vanguard oi Student
Opinion had asked students to
join picket lines, and that there
was only ‘\‘a‘ trickle”. of par-
tictpation.

Mike Peiizner, who has con-
ducted a zealous fund raising
drive lor the strike fund,
suggested that Thursday’s allr
campus meeting be held at 3:00
AM, in the James third john.
Tiiat way, not only can the
stiidcnls discuss the issues, bul
the strike fund people can line
everyone five bucks a piece for
quiet hours. The Senate
dismissed this motion however,
because there is no john on
J'dn‘icsthlrd.

Chuck Garman wanted the
Senate to put the squeeze on the
initiative lurid for it “Macrobiotic
Dinner" to be cooked by one John
Larsen on April 23. When asked
how macrobiotic food differed
from tlle lood that would be
served at Saga that night, Chuck
said that Macrobiotic iood has
no preservatives The Senate
pointed out that Saga food doesn't
have preservatives either,‘ but
Chlick and Ron Stclnllorn went
onto explain that iood is organic,
and therciore. its preparation
and consumption are not
disruptive to the natural enr
\iil‘onment

President Loewi used his
discriminatory powers and asked
for a hand VDIC instead of a votce
vote on the issue of the
macrobiotic dinner. Locwi said
later that a voice vote was imr

SCARLET AND BLACK

The Hisl'ory of Henry Wilhelm and
Krystyna Neuman a+ Grinnell College

Part Three

The litestyle that Henry and
Krys pursue is certainly quite
dlflel'enl from that of most
people, it is perhaps the primary
thing which distinguishes them
trom the rest of society and
makes them, in the town of
Grinnell at least, stand out The
5815 asked Henry Wilhelm and
Krystyna Neuman Just how they
would characterize the way they
live.

First, they emphasized that
mammgm acquisition oi wealth
was not a value to them, as they
tclt ii is to much ol society, They
are not really interested in ace
cumulating a great number of
material posessions, intact, they
have already gotten rid oi or sold
many of the “middle class
clothes” that they had in college,

Second, they said that they do
nol believe in the institution oi
marriage, “especially as the
woman is seen as an extension
of her husband and not in her
own right." perhaps, they teel,
it is too exclusive, and the two
people begin to depend on each
other too much tor their basic
needs.

Work is not as important to
Henry and Krys as it is to most
people in society: neither of them
has a “straight“ job, and they
are content with a relatively low
standard of living. “We won't
give up our ideals to earn a lot
of money,“ Wilhelm said,

They mention that they do not
have any children, and that they
do not plan to have any. One
reason, Krystyna Neuman said.
is that She doesn't feel tllat she
has a “good enough biological
makeup to pass on lo another
generaiion" tshe has diabetes),
Another is tllat they [eel that not
everyone has to have children.
and possibly there is too much
oxctusiveness m a iamily.

"We totally reject mysticism,
religion, or any irrational
lhoughl," Wilhelm mentioned,
and he later added philosophy to
this list.

Conccrning drugs. they said
that they thought that marijuana
was probably sater than alcohol;
however, they don’t use any
drugsat home because ”tile legal
risks are loo great " It is in-
teresting that ole taculty

member told the scan that many
people in the iaeulty have in the
past identitied the Easl street
Gallery with all the drug trailic
on campus Police Chief Bill
Peters. when asked about this,
said lhat he never had any in.
dtcation that there were drugs
in the Gallery

An important part of their lite
style, Henry and Krys said, is
recreation, which to them is
"doing something creative,”
They are only interested in
recreation which is “participant
typc"ratherthanpassive

As it to complete their
characterization of their life
style, Krystyna Neuman said,
“Scx7Welikesex,”

They both emphasized, though,
that although these are their
attitudes now, they may change.
According to Krystyna Neuman,
“this is the way we live now, but
we’re not convinced it is the
ultimate way We’d like to ex-
perimentandlindotherways.”

ln tact, they are actively
planning on establishing a
commune which will emphasize
this experimentation with dif—
ierent ways of living. They hope
to find an alternative life style
within a commune oi the type
patterned alter that outlined in
the book Walden Two by B.‘ F.
Skinner. They would like to form
a commune which would be
organized to a greater extent
than most, and they are willing
to experiment to find the best
way to organize it, in tact, the

main feature of their commune
will be its emphasis on ex-
perimentation, They will try to
work towards a system which
will Value all humans alike no
matter what their skills, alld one
which would be adaptable to
large groups at people.

They have already sent out
some applications, and feel that
it they can attract many young
people to join them, later maybe
some will leave and start their
communes. ln/iact, they think ot
iheir commune, with it's “ex-
perimental attitudeitowards
change" and where the “normal
mode or doing things will be
experimental" as a model for
other people,

They think it Will be
distinguished trom many oi thc
communes that are being
established today by its attitude
towards technology Although
they tool that there has been a
misapplication oi technology in
present day society, ”where the
sole goal at technology is to
create material abundance with
only a small attention on human
welfare," they hope to put it to
good use in their own commune.

When their commune is
established, it will use the
manufacture oi the photographic
print alld Iilm washers that
Wilhelm designed as its economic
base These washers, which are
patented by East Street Gallery,

the grounds crew.

When a job opens up it has
been the policy to let present
Boo employees apply tor the
job. Qualified men have olten
been iound from among these
employees. For example, the
three people in the paint shop
and the Storekeeper came from
the custodial force, and the
second electrician and a car»
penter were hired from the
grounds crew. The College has
hired people from outside,*in
order to get skills they couldn’t
get from among the present
force, but Hawn indicated that
a qualified present employee is
given first preference.

Many other complaints were
stated by the workers inter-
viewed. Hawn was said to feel
that he never makes a mistake.
to be unable to work with
people, to act in a way that
puts him above his employees,
so that they cannot talk to him.
The general feeling was that
l-lawn appeared to have no re
spec: for B&G employees.

Mr. Donald Lambie, College
Treasurer, disagreed. Accord-
ing to Lambie, Mr. Hawn tries
to relate on the judgment of
employees more than his prede-
cessor. “Under Mr. Walden,
employees were to do nothing
without a written work order,
but Mr. Hawn insisted from the
beginning that employees be
allowed to use their own judg-
ment in man matters.” The

Page Five

old procedure. which made use
of work orders, is a very com—
mon procedure in American
colleges.

Regardless of this there is a
sincere distrust at Mr. llawn
among the lzxc employees who
were interviewed. llawn is
known to be blunt, and occa-
sionally, perhaps, he is not stil-
ttCiently Senslliye to the leele
ings pi those [U whom he is
talking. “l'll b0 the first one
to admit that I lack tact, but
the record shows that while i
have been here there have
been no things, the work at em-
ployees has been or good qual-
ity, the wages of employees
has increased, and the Physi-
cal Plant and its employees
ill’e more respected in the Col-
lege community than they were
helorc."

llawn also added that lit
would “navel reprimand a man
loi- making a mistake if he is
working. I believe that any
tindesmnii, espeCially With the
complex trades today, is going
to make errors in the course oi
ll normal day. Alter all, a man
who does no work makes no
errors."

interestingly enough, Hawn
had attempted to set tip a
channel through which he could
learn oi grievances among,
B&G employees. Hawii's pro»
ccdurc was, lrom time to time,
to call the working ioremeii
into the oilice to discuss areas
of concern to the employees.

washers are designed as imr
provements on conventional
ones, The East Street Gallery

The print washers are oi a

Photography magazine
described the East Street Gallery
print washer in a recent issue
as “a beautifully finished rec-
tangular prism oi gleaming
Plexiglass. an ingenious

reaction oi tlicir triends and
associates towards them, No one.
needless to say, was without an
opinion

ltir. lrving It, Howell, owner
oi Bates Flowers in Grinnell, told
the Stu; tllzil he thought his
opinions and the opinions oi most
townspeople towards Wilhelm
could be summarized very easily.
“He ought to leave town," Mr.
Howell said; “He causes nothing
but problems.” Wilhelm, Mr.
Howell indicated, is a serious
problem to town businesses “we
can’t even identiiy ourselves with

tor each print to he Washed in r. the College any more because oi

Henﬁy wllhelm and his type," he
explained, Howell also pointed to
a problem which others had
mentioned: the activities oi
Wilhelm and others make the
money raising task or people in

.the College’s development otiice

much more diiiicult. “We just
can’t understand why kids act
this way. we just can’t unr
derstand it,” he concluded,

liir. Paul Brink. a local
businessman and a long time
resident of Grinnell said that he
is not iamiliar with the con-
troversy as it surrounds Wilhelm
and the college. He said that his
ideas and attitudes have changed
as he has noticed that “many at
the townspeople who are shocked
thy Wilhelm) seem to he the
same people who aren’t shocked
by our activity in Vietnam, and
who are not concerned with our
racial problems.” Mr. Brink said
that relatively low townspeople
do actually know willielin, their
knmi ledge is what they hear ot
him and what they read in his

/.

SCARLET AND BLACK

paper. According to Mr, Brink,
the issues or t>tcrotiactyl which
he saw were ”quite boring." “We
are in a strange soctcly," he
continued. “We get uptight about
minor or superiicial things, but
we let the important issues slide
by.”

One local resident. who has
been in several businesses in
Grinnell and did not wish to be
quoted by name, expressed a
view which was iairly typical oi
those people contacted by the
5&8. He said that he thinks
Wllhelm‘s thinking must be “kind
oisic l' and that “everybody tin
townt that knows something

that it was not an effort for
them to talk about their griev-
:tnces before me. l am in favor
of the grievance procedure es
tablished in the College’s last
contract proposal. It is one oi
the best things that will come
out oi the strike." It has been
the policy of the College in the
past “not to prohibit the right
of any employee to consult dis
rectly on matters oi labor re
lations with any ember oi
the College adm' istration.”
Tllis statement appeared in a
memo sent from the Adminisn
tratlon to employees last Nor
Vember. The memo outlined
the altcmativcs employees had
just beiore they petitioned the
College to hold a referendum
to determine whether they
wished to he represented by
the Teamsters.

Some striking B&G workers
believed that they were and
are in danger oi being fired
because of their recent activ7
ities. The College has stated in
official memorandums to the
B8tG workers that, “Whatever
your own views about unioni—
zation are, the College assures
you that you will not be penal-
ized it you wish to join a union,
that you will not be rewarded
it you do not wish to join a

union; in short. you are free to
take any position yoti wish on
the matter."

l-las Mr, llziwii himself been
guilty or threatening workers
with loss of Job or of promotion
because oi their union activ-
ities? Mary Andes, linen super-
visor {or South Campus, said
she believed not. “In fact, Mr,
Hawn lias leaned over back-
wards." Site pointed out that
much time on the job has been
spent talking about the union
and the strike, rather than
working. it Mr. Hawn were out
in get those who were partici-
pating, shc teels he would have
told her to watch (or and re-
port people who were wasting
time. Mr. Hawn did not. do this.
She feels there may have been
some legitimate grievances. but
that these have been blown
largely out or proportion, partr
ly, she thought, because oi
agitation by students. She was
not approached to join the
union, since she is a supervisor,
but she would not have joined
it she had been approached.
“Compared to other jobs in the
community, this one pays well
both in wages and in fringe
benefits."

Some 3&0 workers, again,
seem to believe that Mr. Hawn
is or was planning to remove
or had threatened to remove
certain fringe benefits which
the workers have been receiv-

mg. The greatest of these is the
provision which allows the chilr
dren oi those who have been
employed by the College for 3
years or more to attend Grin-
iiell College tuition tree. This,
and other lringe benelits, are
set tlowii in the College’s em
ployee guidebook. It should be
noted that lltiwn himself has
not the power to change any
lienciits granted in this book
He is not ever consulted on
such questions.

Another complaint about Mr.
llawn arises from the tact that
in some job classifications,
people doing the same job are
receiving a different wage.
Some workers see this as a way
[or Mr. Hawn to reward iavor-
lies. According to Mr. l-lawn.
when the current wage sched-
ule was about to go into eitect,
he worked out the general
wage structure and then sub-
mitted these guidelines to the
working toremen for their rec-
ommendations. “I wanted the
employees to have a say in
this, I took their recommenda-
tions," Hawn pointed out that
the discrepancy between high-
est and lowest wage within a
class is not more than 15c exr
cept in the cases at mechanics.

Most, but not all, of the in»
mdrs about Mr. Hawn appear
groundless, but it is perahps
understandable why they arose.

A Grinnell business man, Mr,
Chuck DeLong, of tile Grinnell
class of 193i, who feels that he
may represent the establishment
in Grinnell fairly well, said that
Wilhelm’s actions fascmate him.
Looking at Wilhelm from a kind
at psychoanalytical viewpoint, he
sees wilhclm, who came irorn a
broken home, as “probably
venting hostility on the world."
Wilhelm, Mr DeLong said, is
upsetting many things 7 for
example, the relationship be
tween the college and alumni who
are potential donors. “Very
possibly, his actions could be
construed as a cry for help," Mr.
DeLong said, “and I just wish
someone was smart enough to
give us an answer." Mr, DeLong
added that he takes his hat ott
to most of the young people who
are rebelling at the hypocrisy
of the establishmenl, and he
thinks that “these youngsters
have a great chance to prove that
bigotry and ignorance are
synonymous.”

Furthermore, the tltings which a
