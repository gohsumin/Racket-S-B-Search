Causes and Solutions to Poverty

Symposium Calls for Construoiive hadicalism

Power Politics
Only Way

SAUL ALINSKY talks with interested
students on organizing for change.

“College today ls like a stagecoach
on the highway” said Saul Alinsky. “Col-
lege should be the training ground for
nrganizers." Organized power for re-
iorm. not idealistic daydreaming, is the
only way to construct a better world.

Community Organization was the topic
of “Prnfessional radical" Saul Aliusky.
Wednesday afternoon to the student
Symposium oi Poverty.

The veteran organizer stressed the
need for organization in order to obtain
the necessary power required to affect
change. “Unless you have the power,
everything else is rhetorici Power is pos-
rible through organizing. Organizing
should be done around issues which are
specific immediate, and realizablei An
issue is what you can do something
about,"

In talking about the Black Power
movement, he stressed the need for or-
ganized power along with the gaining oi
black identity. “Black Culture is esssen-
tial," but he warned. “One does not get
identity without power," “No number of
Dashikies, naturals, sunglasses or soul
food is power."

“if you want to change the world to
what you'd like it to be you must start
irom where you are," He suggested that
those interested in change “must get
with the world as it is." “There are
three things one must know about what
is,

1. people act in sell interest.

2. right things get done for the wrong

reason.

' 3. never make value judgments on the
basis or what is right but on the
basis of alternatives"

He stressed that i: any change is to
occur, elements at the middle class
whito society must also be included as
power allies. it all minority groups were
to become united they would still he in
the minority, requiring the aid at middle
L whites. He further commented that
“basically any people can be organ-
izer ."

Iiiter the lecture Mt: Alinsky answer-
ed questions and discussed student par-
ticipation in change at an iniormai ses-
sion at Conference House, He also pals
ticipated in the attarnoon panel on “The
Role of Community Acts in Reducing
Poverty.”

Keynote ~
Rational Action

By MICHAEL BRANDON

“! think we owe it to Ourselves to lis-
ten to student pmtestors to see what
they're saying," Dr. Robert Coles, a
Harvard University research psychia-
trist, said here Tuesday nighti

“It is not enough to decry the tactics
oi some students who take it upon them—
selves to occupy buildings when protest-
ing and demonstrating," Coles said. ”We
need to use all the understanding, com<
passion, and sensitivity We can mobilize
e—mt hysteria, not labeling, not name
Calling."

Coles, who is a contributing editor for
New Republic magazine. delivered his
remarks in a keynote address during
Grinneli's Student Symposium on Pov-
erty.

Coles told an audience of some 250
persons in Herrick Chapel that his gener-
ation uses young ‘demolistrators as
"scapegoats" when it criticizes them.
“We rail against them, rather than
rail against our own weakness and
failure."

“I love this country and I consider
myseli loyal,” Coles continued, “but 1
also realize that America has serious
problems that must be tackled and not
glossed overt"

Coles criticized the United States for
spending billions or dollars on space
exploration and the Vietnam War while

aiternoon's ilag demonstration,
protesting the Vietnam war, will
appear in next week's Scarlet and
Black.

millions of Americans “are on the edge
or severe hunger, living the kind ot life
that can only be described as desperate,
painiul. and lacking sell-respect."

He also criticxzed those who tell the
needy “to Wait a little longer” and have
patience. “We owe it to ourselves to
realize that we suiler as others Stiller
and that when others don’t have, We
lack," he said,

Speaking or the recent disruptions at
Harvard, Coles said that he thought
some of the protesters acted “rudely and
maliciously," but that the disruptive
actions forced the administration to pay
heed to various demands.

“Rudeness is a bad sin,’ he added,
“but so is the rudeness of sellesatisfac-
tion, complacency, aild the contentment
of a Brooks Brothers suit and a Harvard
degree."

He said that the dissident students
“made the Harvard Corporation realize
that restructuring (the University) is an
important goal that has to be met."

Coles said that he found some of the
protesters to be “as nasty and arrogant
as some DI the Harvard administrators.

“However, i don’t think the students
were being purely distructive,” he ex-
plained. “A large number or them were
ethically concerned young Americans.”

Labels and names such as “the genera
ation gap” or “slits.” are not important
issues, Coles Said “The real issue isl
l-low yielding will we be to the cry ior
justice, we who have so much},

PTERO. Home for Now

A U.S. District Court judge last Wed-
nesday ordered iowa Attorney General
Richard Turner to return copy and photo
graphs his agents illegally seized irorn
Pterodactyl, Grinnell's underground
paper.

Judge Roy L. Stepheson ruled that the
confiscation oi the allegedly obscene ma-
terial at a Wilton Junction printing shop
on Mar. 13 was illegal because “no War-
rant tor the seizure of the materials We!
ever sought or issued"

Stephenson, however, denied a request
by Pterndactyl staff members for $11,000
in damages from the attorney general’s
oilice and an injunction to prevent lure
ther seizure of Pterodactyl materials,

The suit was tried by Grinnell phot0<
grapher Henry Wilhelm and Grinnell
junior Lawrence Frank, who were both
present at the SR Printers shop when
the material was seized. Attorney Clark
Holmes oi the Iowa Civil Liberties Union
handled the case for Pterodactyl.

Named as derendants in the suit along
with iurner were Asst, Atty. Gen. Doug-
las Carlson, Robert C. Blair, Director
of the Bureau of Criminal investigation,
and BC] agents Daniel Mayer and Terry
C. Johnson.

Stephenson ruled that the law enforce-
ment officials were immune irom civil
damages because they were acting with
in their oiiicial jurisdiction as agents or
the attorney general’s office

Although Turner testified that the ma-
terial was obscene, Stephenson ruled
that his testimony to that etlect had no
bearing on the Case.

“It is not the purpose or the law to
permit the dissemination of obscene ma-
terials but to prevent the abridgement
ot the right in a free society to un-
obstructed circulation ot non-obscene
materials,” Stephenson said in his rul-
mg.

Wilhelm, who went to Des Moines
Thursday to recover the material, told
the 5&3 he was not pleased with the
court’s actions.

“The court order to return the material
was much too long in coming." Wilhelm
said, reierring to the lact that Ptero-
dactyl was deprived of the right to pub-
lish the material for almost six weeks

Wilhelm also said that he and Frank
will appeal their request for damages
iron. Turner and the other agents. “It
public officials cannot be held respon—
sible for their actions it gives them a
free license to harass anyone they want,”
he said.

Wilhelm said that he is “working to
find a printer" and that he expects to
publish the seized material plus tour ad-
ditlonal pages about the seizure in an
issue of Plerodactyl that would be dis-
tributed next week.

Wilhelm said that he and his lawyer
expect Turner to ﬁle obscenity charges
when Pterodactyl is published, but that
they are confident that the courts would
not find Pterodactyl obscene.

S udenl Harassed
Racist Arrested

Last week, Roy Walker '69, a black
student, tiled charges in Justice of the
Peace Court in Grinnell against a man
who he identified as having passed him
in a car and shouted racial slurs at him.
Vernon Schooley of Grinnell pleaded
guilty to the charge of disturbance of the
peace and was fined $25.

Schooley was in a car with three or
four others when they passed Walker
last Thursday and shouted racial slurs,
such as “nigger", at him. when the car
passed, Walker tried to get the license
number, but the car was too dirty for
him to read it. Knowing from past ev-
perience that they would probably be
back, he waited, and when they ape
peared again, he copied the license num-
her from the front of the car. He then
gave this iniormation to the Grinnell
Police Department, and Schooley was
picked up within a half hour.

Although others in the car, construe
tion workers in their early twenties,
had also shouted these slurs at him,
Walker could only positively identify
Schooley, so he only tried one complaint.
This was the first time, however, that a
complaint had been tried, although this
harassment “is not unusual at all,” ac~
cording to Walker.

Walker said that incidents like this one
occur “constantly," and there have been
cases involving visiting black dignitaries,
as well as black students Usually, how-
ever, the students are unable to get the
license number of the car.

Grinnell Police Chief Bill Peters told
the 58:}! that this is the first time any
such case has gona into court, since the
offenders have been juveniles in all the
previous cases he knew oil in these
cases, Peters said, he has brought them
and their parents to the police station,
and talked to them, “eyeball to eyeball."

Political Dealing Begins

By TED GLICK

Although most of Wednesday night'l
Senate meeting was rather mundane,
one notable event did occur concerning
the choice of a new Finance Committee
chairman. The decision, now nullified
due to the reopening oi applications tor
all Committees, appeared to he the first
“political dealing” oi the new adminis-
tration.

Freshman senator Andrew Brill had
been interested in being on the com.
mittee and attended the April 15 meet.
ing of the Committee with SGA Presi-
dent, Jim Lew. At that meeting the
old administration recommended wide-
spread budget changes including a $50
cut in the AWS and Com? salaries.
Committee member Michael Saeger en-
dorsed this measure to tighten a slim
budget and because the jobs are now
less demanding

Brill and Saeger applied for the posi-
tion of Finance Committee Chairman.
Brill recommended acrosstherboard sall
ary increases for SGA, AWS and Coil-l?
presidents. A board composed of Ernest
Weston, Jane West, Jim Lew. Frank
Thomas. and Bill Thomas chose Erlll for
the chairmanship,

Hillbilly is Overthrown By Queen of the Mountain

Beiore spring break the Student Ailairs Committee asked lor applications for the
use or the collegeowned ditcampus houses. Several naive students submitted proa
posals to the proper “decision making” machinery 7 the Student Altairs Committee.

The committee accepted several proposals, and many left for vacation happy at
the prospect or living in their desired environments. The folklore house group became
known as the prospective residents of “Hillybilly Heaven.” It looked as though this
Hoposal, which had the unotlicial backing oi the American Studies department (Mr.

ergen), was going to be a reality and that they could pretty well count on home«

ltead rights for '69-'70.

it became progressively more apparent, however, that in the studenHaculty, ad-
ministration trinity which composes the committee, the administration is the most
omnipotent body. Dean Low decided that oi the approved proposals, which were the
coed German House, the coed Inner College (2 houses), and the Men's Folklite
House, only the German House is acceptable in its proposed form. The Inner College,
she says, can probably have one women’s house. The men in Inner College are out,
and the Folklile House gets the good old American lurk in the eye.

The reason: the number 01 spaces [or women has to remain constant, and if 10
or 12 men moved into Pine Tree the balance would be upset.

Now this may be lair enough to say, but why should there be about lo men
in German House. The reason for this is also simple: The German House is a pet

project of Dean Stauss.

it is apparent alter this action (not quite linal as yet) that the administration
should examine its priorities. Does it really want to replace the Wasteland oi resi-
dential lile at Gl'innell with something more meaningtul, or does it want to proceed
at its own “smooth” pace and not rock the boat. An underclass male student has no
alternative to the dormitory system than to live nilvcampus illegally and pay double
rent. Dean Low is proving to the students as Well as to the faculty, which is also
represented by the Student AIIairs Committee, that she is willing and able to over-
ride any decisions they may make. Dean Low might just. as well do away with the
superﬂuous Student Attairs Committee it she is not going to take its decisions

seriously. it seems not outside her realm bl power.

therelore, the duty of all to give oi all we
can. Our cause is just. “We lind no es-
cape lrom our course it we are to lind
justice." ~ Ghalldi

On Tuesday oi this week, I joined al-
most 250 student body presidents and
newspaper editors lrum across the coun-
try in expressing our intent to reiuse to
serve in the armed forces at the United
5 . tes as long as the Vietnam war con-
ti ues. Our statement says in port. “hav-

ig worked ihmugh legal processes with-

ourselves left without other alterna-
iives.”

The release goes on to state that “we
will reluse induction and aid and support
lilose who decide to rel " . We now milst
number ourselves among those students
who cannot at this time square military
duty with integrity and conscience."

At the present time, a statement pt
complic:ty with dralt resistors is being
circulated here at Grinnell. Tl‘idt state-
ment reads as iollows:

The fund eniul iln norality and in-
c‘ casing brutality ci our nation’s course
in Vieiliﬂm compels us to commit our
lives to changing that course. Responsr
biiity lies ivith each oi us. The killing
must be stopped. we stand with lilose

talk of the town

By FREDRICKA NELSON

liberals, students. ylppies—niggers all
to some 7 we've made the trout page
of the herald register. perhaps i should
say jeri-y rubin has made it for us. pol<
itics is deserving in general, and we de
served a good part or two columns and
numerous photos. 1 would like to take
this opportunity to comment on the of-
fnir, as it probably has been the talk
of the town or will be for a few weeks.
in the heraldrregister article i noticed a
couple of good phrases: "students at-
tired in deliberately raggedy clothing,”
and “‘jerry’s here, he's in the bath-
room.‘ ” since i haven’t studied the
whole article i won't make any “deliber-
ate" comments on its point or view or
content. let it be said that we were
noticed.

at the rubin assembly you had to have
your seat lrom the lirst because the
college community turned out lor the
“yippie night” abundantly. that seems
rather paradoxical since we’re supposed—
ly closer to the “liberal" tradition. we
hetrayed our interest in the sensational
>— even in “educated” circles sensation-
alists have lots or appeal. no reflection
is meant in mr. rubin. only, as the doors
have said, “people are strange,” espe-
cially in their pretensions. but that‘s
another rap and i’ll go into it some
other time.

i was most comfortable at the assemr
hly with jerry rubin, and i think i know
just exactly why. mr. rubin has a mar-
velous sense 01 humor and he uses It
to try and communicate a “very ser-
ious thing” called revolution. i suppose
the evening would have been even more
entertaining ii i had been there from
the time the ﬁrst bubble burst til the
happy-ending hand shake.

by contrast to hernadine dorhn and
the other “heavy" politicos that i heard
last week. jeiry rubin looked strange,
but sounded remarkably human. it was
pointed out in the panel discussion that

followed that the audience should have
thought more deeply than its gleeiul
reaction indicated. it that’s Valid at all,
it’s only a little bit so, the rest of the
weekend emphasized the way people set
themselves apart from each other with
ideologies and styles. sometimes these
differentiallons are interesting, but to a
lew oi us they are the things that the
revolution should squash. we have had
such a long and murderous history at
clashes because of “the way we‘re
made." war, poverty alienation and
every other evil that you can imagine
springs ii‘om some dumb fool man look-
ing at his neighbor with everything but
love, and not doing god's commandment
to treat the other dude just like he would
like to be treated himself. in: not say—
ing there's only one holy way to show
your tellow beings how to make it. you
can use any words or gestures that lit
the meaning, but you sure better do it.

even it you couldn’t stand it) look at
rubin, you almost have to admit that
he didn't use his words to inistrate your
mind into change. which is a very fine
touch to climax a political week. god,
the big man in the sky, told us a long
time ago that we’d never know nutltin‘,
though we continue to die trying. the
thing that i remember in particular
about mr. rubin was that. he said he was
a man who loves to shake hands With
people, what could be more appropriate
tor the politician of gladness than [0
use with loving care the gesture of tho
politician oi amelica.

i‘ve said enough about jerry rubin and
where We ended up leads right into
something a reverend spoke on the oth-
er sunday. reverend robcrt e, dewey de-
livered a good talk on the heretical per-
spective today.

he also oilered interesting views or
jc‘s time, can you imagine what an an-
archist christ was in his day and how
he probably seemed to the priests to be
the jerry rubin of rome?

Revolution Fertile Hell of It

To the Editor

I was asked to give an ”overview",
of the New Leit Conierence. Well, 0.x.
Here's an overview.

Paul Goodman is against water and
air pollution and wishes young radicals
were too.

Ernie chambers quotes the Bible and
Andrew Young realizes that big corpor-
ations are his enemy.

Allard Lowensteln thinks we can pur-
ily America by electing a lew more
“good lolk" like him to Congress.

nernadiue Dohrn wants a cooperative
rather than competitive economic sys
tem to abolish racism and imperialism.

Jerry Rubin knows that you change a
society with your lile and your body,
not with intellectual rhetoric.

Hal Draper thinks that third party
politics. (a la the 30‘s) is our hope for
the future.

Actually, it all happened just beiore
Robin’s Speech. Balloons, bubbles, llags,
Yippiel, FREE, and ilying money zlll
over the pl Somewhere between the
sio and M000 was given or thrown
away A 55 oil was burned in the bal-
cony. One of the balloons had a $20 bill
in it.

That was the New Politics Conlei-ence.
That was the New Politics. Rev . ,
For I!“ Hell til it is here. And its here
to stay.

li you listened to the speeches and
pad attention to all those words, line.
But don‘t be deceived. That wasn't the
New Politics Conference. The New Pol-
itics happened with the lull garbage can

happened when prot. Al Jones called
Rubin “pathetic” and everyone was too
busy playing with balloons to notice. it
happened with 3.000 balloons. $50, and a
whole lot of good vibes liying through
the air all at once. To some people it
never happened. Sorry if you missed it,
it was a helluva lot of fun.

By scientilic. obiective, analysis,

New Politics Commended

To the Editor:

i wanted to express my appreciation
to the Student Planning Committee and
Plotessor Gilmollr. Director oi the Pro-
gram iii Practical political Education,
lor their role in bruising to Grinnell the
Conierence on the New politics.

During my live years at Grinnell there
have been many occasions when people
have descended upon Grinnell lor educa-
tonnl purposes — lectures, coltee hours,
conferences, and canvocotions. Few. in
my opinion, have been as worthwhile as
last weeks conference.

in addition to the substantive iniorma-
tion made available to the college coin-
niunity, there were some additional
bcnelits realized. To those students who
organized the Coniei-ence there was the
valuable experience or doing so and to
nose skeptical at entrusting sludents
with such responsibilities there is the
e,idence lhat student involvement is not
necessarily dangerous.

New Politics Quesl‘ions Unanswered

By DIXIE HARRINGTON

The New Politics Conference
posed the same old questions,
and answered none of them. In
every speech there was some
major tlaw that weakened the
whole argument. in several
question and answer sessions,
good questions raised key is-
sues, which the speakers evad-
ed.

What is most frustrating to
many of us who would like to
work effectively for social
change is that while we realize
it is most effective to work
within a group or movement,
we can find no group which is

satisiactory. Wouldehe activists
are held back by well-justified
doubts about atiiliating with
any particular group or follow-
ing any particular plan or ac-
ticn.

Rather than reaching conclus-
ions train the conterence, I
preier to restate certain un<
answered questions which must,
i think, be answered convinc-
ingly e and i find Mr. Rubin's
jubilant anarchy and Miss
Dohm’s handmedown Marr-
ism just as uncor incing as Mr.

No Petting

By MICHAEL BRANDON

Although Grinnell men are
now permitted to entertain
women in their rooms, the
residence halls are Still off«
limits to men's real best friend,
the dog.

The College doesn’t mind
petting in the residence halls —-
as long as pets aren't involved.
Animal lovers who want to be
iriends with Fido have to live
off—campus.

The College's attitude to-
wards pets was rather clearly
revealed in the following mem-
orandum sent to a resident of

Read (Hendrix) Hall last week:

As stated in the srudent Handbook,

appreciate your coonrrntion.

Thank you,

The onslaught of spring seems
to have turned the tancy or
young Grinnellians to animals.
Mrs. Anderson said that the
warm weather brought with it
“the worst problem I’ve seen."
She estimated that she has had
to deal with around 15 inci-
dents involving Student pets
this year.

She said that the College ban
on pets in residence halls “is
certainly necessary," explain-
ing that “the messes they (the
pets) create are leit there tor
a long time and the maids
have to clean up."

College Assistant Business
Manager Ralph l<. Polnerenk
explained that the College pet
policy “is primarily based on
the questions or noise, sanita<
tlon, and property damag .

Pomerenk said that bar ing
is “a universal practice" in
dormitory situations, and that
Grinnell has never allowed pets
in the residence halls tn the
best oi his knowledge.

He said that space problems
make pets in the halls unde-
sirable, and that pets are not:
easily housebrokco.

Pomerenk noted that dogs
create a problem because they
“chew and gnaw on turniture,
and sometimes invite critters
such as fleas."

“In a hall where there is an

unattended dog it’s an unsani-
tary, stinking mess," he added.

Pumerenk said that special
error: is made by the house-
keeping stati to Inform students
in advance that they cannot
keep pets in their rooms, so
that students don‘t become at
tached to their pets and then
have to give them away.

“We hope that students will
understand the long range sig~
nificance," he said.

Pomerenk said that his staff
is lenient about enforcing the
no-pet rule when students have
aquariums. ”Fish don’t offer
the problems a four-footed crit-
ter does,” he explained,

“HDWCV6r,” Pomerenk con-
tinued, "we do move in on get-
bils, hamsters, and guinea
pigs because they otter aroma
problems and leakage prob-
lems."

Pomerenk said that a recent
problem he had to deal with in-
volved a lamb that was being
kept in the Younkel‘s. “I don’t
know anyone who's able to
housebreak a lamb," he pointed
out.

He Said that dealing with the
lamb problem was especially
difficult because “lambs are
sort or clumsy little things that
people get emotional about,"

“The lamb became ill, and I
understand that when lambs be-
come ill they usually ci-oak,"
Pomerenk said, Apparently the
lamb in question did, Indeed,
pass away.

Pomerenk also expressed
concertt about the groups at
dogs that have been romping
around campus lately. “When
you get a whole bunch of them
chasing a bitch in heat they
become oblivious to people,"
he said.

“The students like to watch
them because it's biologysinrac-
timl," he continued, “but we
try to discourage it."

Dean oi Students 5. Eugene
Thompson expressed concern
about. the dog packs lte SEES in
iront oi Burling Library be
cause “they get vicious when
people rough-house with them."

“The dogs really get pretty
flakey," Thompson chuckled.
“and i guess they develop dog
neuroses."

Thompson said that permite

ting pets in the halls would.
create housekeeping problems,
and that pets might get mis-
treated.

“You can have some pretty
weird problems," Thompson ex-
plained, He said that students
Sometimes lock kittens in their
closets when they go to class.
“The kittens sort or Ioul up the
place and make noise, and
sometimes ‘even go Crazy."

In addition to the problem of
mistreatment, Thompson point-
ed out that “if you get enough
animals together in a hall, it
tends to smell pretty bad."

Perhaps one explanation tor
the sudden “petomenia” at
Grinnell is the opening of a
downtown pet store last month.

Shirley Lillie, manager or
Grinnell Aquarium and Pet
Supply, said that so far- she
hasn‘t sold many pets to col‘
lege students. She did sell one
Siamese cat and one dog to stu-
dents, but she said that the
students were probably oif—
campus residents.

Students living on—campus
have bought “quite a few fish,"
she said, and one girl bought a
kitten. The girl later returned
the kitten after she brought it
to class and her protessor told
her she shouldn’t keep it.

Dean Thompson asked the pet
store manager not to sell to col-
lege students, but emphasized
that he didn’t order her to do
so.

“You can’t tell people what
to do," Thompson said.

By MARY MALCOLM

Foreword: I interviewed seven Grin-
nell students about their experiences
with abortions. Six were girls who have
had abortions. One was a boy whose
girlfriend, not at Grimell, had an abor-
tion. The emphasis on the girls is un-
doubtedly misplaced. The decision not
to interview the boys involved in six
or the cases was purely tactical —
1 already had more material tor the
story than I could possibly use.

I did this article for two reasons.
One is to remind Grinnell students
that abortion laws exist and transform
a rather minor operation into a ma-
jor crisis in two people‘s lives. Per-
haps this article can contribute to a
general awareness of the need to re-
peal these unjust and inhumane laws.
My other reason for writing the article
Is to help to create an atmosphere at
Grinnell where human sexuality and
the dilemmas surrounding it cease to
be shrouded in secrecy and shame, but
can be openly raced and discussed.
The unwanted pregnancy is perhaps
the most secretive or all aspects or
sexuality, but this secrecy only re-
Ilects our more general taboos and
fears concealing sexual behavior.
The stories I will tell are in the words
of the people involved. I have edited
and rearranged extravagantly, and
offer my apologies for any misrepre<
sentatinns of teelings or experiences.
Names are not mentioned. While some
of the individuals involved share my
opinion that secrecy about abortion is
damaging both to the person involved
and to others who ought to be exposed

Abortion — A Reality for Grinnell Women s

to the experience, the fact of lllegality
remains.

Girl A: “I was in a state of shock and
disbeliet. The whole way it was arranged
was super-underground, in the Al Capone
sense of the word. We met the Contact
at a motel parking lot. My boylriend
couldn’t go with me. This little greasy
man took me to another motel where the
doctor was. When I walked in he said,
"Well, you're my fourth tonight." He
wasn’t a very protessional-looking per-
son. I couldn’t tell it they sterilized the
the things they used, They had a big
plastic sheet on the bed and he per-
formed it on the bed. He tried to calm
me and I had tranquilizers. The greasy
little man tumed out to be kind of nice.
He talked with me and joked with me the
whole time. Ijust had a local anesthetio
~novocaine in the vagina. The ﬁrst ten
minutes were okay. I was fairly re-
laxed. The little man kept talking to me
and joking about girls irom lowa. He
was saying I must be one of those tough,
corn—led girls. And he was saying he’d
had a couple or other girls from Grin-
nell come to him.

“The last live minutes when he was
scraping out the uterus were extremely
painful. I thought I was going to die. I
had to give him the money ahead of
time, which was sort oi frightening. He
tinished the abortion and they were still
joking around, trying to get me to relax
because I was very nervous by then and
hard to work on. Then he said ‘Well.
I'd just like to tell you that you're not
pregnant anymore.’ And then they said.
‘Weli, when are we going to see you
here again?’ And I wasn't teeiing very
goodrhumored and just said, 'Well, I
don’t know.’ He said ‘What do you mean?
We’re never going to see you ngainl' "

If Anything Happened. . .

r was just horrilied at the idea ol going
through that again. And then the greasy
little man took me back to the motel
parking lot to meet my boytriend. 1 just
had the physical thing to go through
because I was in a state of disbelief. I!
was much worse for him. He had to
wait and think about things like telling
my parents it anything happened.n

notion of what the operation entailed
and how serious it was. There was tear
in general about her, about her health
and mental state, and how it would at:
rect us. i telt badly in a way, the whole
thing was more a trial on her than it
was on me. I didn’t seem to be quite as
directly involved in the whole thing. Al-
though I was, I didn't seem to be. She
was the one who was having the baby,
having the operation. All I could do was
just be with her."

Girl B: “It caused some crisis in our
relationship at the time because at the
tension. But after the abortion it was
just heaven — it was the high point or
the relationship. In fact, during the
abortion: as much as I could think, the
fact that he was there, holding my head
and hand. We weathered so very, very
well this major crisis in our relationship.
It can’t help but bring people closer to
gether.”

Girl C: “If it weren’t for the money
Ind my having to conceal it irom my
talks I’m kind of grateful for the exper-
ience because I’ve learned how much I
can really trust members or my iamily
and some of my friends. I think my rc-
lationshlp with my boyiriend has gotten
better. It’s made me a much more lea<
tenable person just because I really real-
ize more about what intercourse means.
It’s not mythical or anything anymore."

Girl D: “It brought us closer together.
'All of a sudden we were considering
practical things that we had never had
to consider at Grinnell. If anything our
relationship is stronger and better now.
Now there’s not anything we can’t talk
about. i think even it people aren't hav-
ing intercourse or are using contra-
ceptives, they should tall-r about abortion.
It's something people don't talk abou .
’Ihat’s unfortunate. I've never talked to
my parents at all, about anything. I
think if I had, I probably would have
been able to talk to them about the
abortion. But it made me feel so much
more responsible to have handled some-
thing that could have been a crisis by
mysell, without their help. It made me
feel proud, like I knew my own mind. I
haven't lelt better emotionally for a long
time. I was going out of my mind before
it happened: conflicts with parents, reel-
lng so secretive, unable to study."

Had To Put On Facade

Girl E: “I was obsessed with being
pregnant. 1 had to get an abortion to live
through the whole thing. Belore that I

cently have I begun to talk about It. i
still have a few guilt pangs, not: obou
killing the baby but what it could havd
done to me. I was very healthy at tho
time, and that probably had some;
thing to do with my being alright atten-
wards. I was so relieved afterwards .—
I tell like a huge burden had been llhedt
i wouldn't say anything, had to put on a
tacade before parents and blends,
couldn’t communicate With my boyfriend
I was really shook up about it. I knew i
was doing the wmng thing. I should have
gone to mother. But I couldn't. it would
have hurt her because I hadn't gone 3
her before, for birth control. She would
have blamed herself. For a while )
blamed her, but now I’m getting mori
perspective. It astonished my boyfriend
that it would happen to me (notel E'I
boyiriend was not the rather. The preg.
nancy occurred during a summer od
separation). Later he said “Ray, we’ve
really been through a lot but we've come
through it. I think we can make
through the rest of life,”

(Note: E’s abortion was performed by
an unlicensed immigrant doctor with no
anesthetic whatsoever, in a friend's a-
partment. He washed the instruments
with soap and hot water, but did nOI
sterilize them. Her abortion, at $250,
was one or the more dangerous and
certainly the most painful and frighten
ing of those I heard described.)

“It's really scary. It’s really irightens
ing because of all the things you asso-
ciate with abortion — back rooms, and
it’s dark. All the movies. It’s a ten-la
bly trightening, ugly thing to think about.
It's just so crazy, when you think that in
Russia it you’re pregnant and you don _
want a baby you just go to a hospital and
in 48 hours you get an abortion -— it's
just accepted. I don’t think it lessened
my belief in God or my ability to love at
all, I think it enhanced it. I never talked
the abortion over before. i decided the
only way was to iorget about it, I’ve
never really told anybody lrom begin.
ning to end. I think it's good to talk
about it. My story is pretty scary. It
goes to show that abortion laws should
be changed. I’d hate anybody to go
through what 1 went through."

It’s Out Of Your Life

Girl F: “When I got back I realized the,
abortion had taken up so much or my
time and energy that there was just a
void. You suddenly realize that you've
got to stop thinking about it now. It's
out of your liie. Often I look back at I!
now and I can’t believe it happened and
then l realize it tlid happen.”

Girl E: “i think the general campus
feeling on abortion was one of secrecy.
I didn't share that leeling. If others
asked my advice, I’d give them my
experience, lavorabie as it was, but
not encouragement It's up to the illdiVld—

experience and not hide it from any-
one."
Boyl “I haven't told very many peo-
‘tple. It‘s not like we're trying to keep
it a really big secret, but there is a
hesitanoy to let it be known, I just
didn’t feel like I really wanted very
many people to know. I think'that they
ought to know that stuff like this does
happen and is present, but I don’t par-
ncularly want them to associate it
.With me. The people I told have been
friends. The others, I don't see how it
could matter to them that I personally
have had this abortion. I guess if they
could relate it to a definite person it
would seem a lot more real. I suppose
all the "good liberals" would say if it's
the alternative we chose that would be
our decision. But I don't know how ii:
‘would affect their relationship to me if
they knew that I personally had gone
through this. I just had a vague idea that
I disagreed with abortion laws before,
but it's quite a bit more real to me now.”
Girl C: “The only harm I could see in
changing abortion laws is that people who
‘don’t want abortions will be forced to
have them by people who are ashamed.
I think it would be completely up to
the individual, If abortion were real easy
it would be good but I think a person
should have to think about what the
relationship means and what the baby
means, and then deside on her own inv
stead of just doing the natural thing,
iivhat everyone else does."
My parents would have taken me out
5“ school, taken me home, forced me to
have the Child. They would have been
in mortal shame. I would have had to
suit school and not come back. They
want the best {or me, but they couldn't
stand the shame it would have brought
on the family. If I told them now, they
would condemn it. I doubt if they would
‘believe it at first. I think they would
think it best that I handled it myself."

As If Nothing Happened

Girl B: ”I had it right before Christ-
mas vacation. I had to lie that the car
broke down to excuse getting home a few
days later. i had to go on just as if
nothing had happened: go out and shovel

'snow, go skiing, play outdoors as usual.
I bled for three or four weeks and l was
really weak. I got tired of living a lie.
Finally i told them two nights before
I left for school. My parents aren’t
against intercourse, they think it's up
to me, although they've ingrained in

acne the idea that it’s terrible and dirty
before marriage. They're for legalizing
abortion, but against illegal abortions
because of the danger to the person.
But as much as they're against abor-
tion, they’re not upset with me for hav-
ing had one, but for getting in a situa-
tion where I needed one .”

Boy: “I told my parents afterwards.
They were mostly concerned for her
health. When we told her parents, they
didn’t want to talk with me right away.
So they went off to her father's study
to talk. They were very disappointed
in her and concerned about her health.
They were especially hurt and disap<
pointed for her not telling them. They
weren’t particularly angry. It’s almost
like it’s over and done with and there’s

"ho sense in harping on it.”

Girl F: ”I won't tell my parents. I’m
protecting them. I was in a strange mood
while i was home because 1 had to hide
things like morning sickness. Mother ev-

when I was home. She would certainly

It’s not as if I could be around day af~
ter day to keep explaining it to her. !
was very frightened by the idea of hav-
ing to tell my parents, They'd be very
shocked. It’s something single girls
shouldn’t be able to have done because
they should be punished for their illicit
acts of intercourse. They think it should
be available for some people but not
everyone because it would promote
promisculty.”

Parents Helpless Too

Girl E: “I think part of the problem
with parents is the illegality. If you come
to them, they’re as helpless as you are.
They don't know where to find a safe
abortionist. They don’t think it’s a bad
thing to have a baby, just irresponsible.
But what can they do?"

Girl C: “When the doctor told me I
was pregnant it was like hysteria. I
didn't know what to do. I had to take
exams and everything. By the time I
found out that a friend’s mother could
arrange it and I could borrow the money
I was used to the tension. I was numb. I
wasn't afraid of the pain — just of
my parents’ knowing. I went to a wo-
man with no medical training. She’s
been very successful, had only a few
accidents and they haven't been fatal.
She tried to induce labor by stuffing a
small rubber tube with air trapped in
it into the uterus. It was very, very
painful and I don’t think it's supposed to
be and it bled. Then cotton and other
things are stuffed in. The pressure
builds up and that causes the foetus to
be dislodged. She was very good, i felt
like I Could trust her a lot. She told me
exactly what would happen and how
i would know if something was going
wrong and when to go to the hospital.
And she told me definitely to go to the
hospital when the thing got out. It was
supposed to come out within eight
hours. I was really sick for about two
hours. Then nothing happened for about
eighteen hours. Then it just plopped out
and I knew there was something wrong.
Two days after that. I went to the hospi-
tal. I’d been bleeding quite heavily for
all that time. The intern said I'd need
a D. and C. (dilatation and curettage
~involves a widening of the cervix and
scraping of the uterus. This method
was used on A and B with local
anesthetics, and Du E without any
anesthetic at all) because the foetus was
partially dislodged. He said 1 would just
have gone on bleeding if I hadn’t come
in. i spent that night at the hospital and
the next day had the operation under
general anesthetic. There was no pain at
all. I left the hospital that alternoon.
The total bill was $280. The doctor said
"if you don’t want us to noiily your
parents we want." They didn‘t ask
where I was staying."

Like A Fantasy

Boy: “Throughout the entire preg-
nancy it just didn’t seem like reality.
it was just like it was something off in
another world. I’d just sit down and try
and make myself realize that this was
my situation and it just didn’t register
at all it was like a fantasy while I was

going through lt and it still is. The
only thing that wasn’t like that was the
doctor. I think that was because he
was really wonderful. He was trying to
make us feel at ease and get us into his
confidence. We’d just sit with him and
talk about his actions against the abor-
tionlaws.

He was talking about how he was a
rebel, he was living What he believed in,
trying to relate it to kids on college
campuses, saying he was similar to
them except he was putting more on the
line because he was a licensed surgeon
and risking his career. We were in a pri-
vate home. The most distinctive thing
was the way he controlled the atmos-
phere. He showed more compassion, con-
corn, and feeling than the usual notion
of an abortionist.”

(Note: D and F went to the same abor-
tionist as did the boy.)

Girl F: “It was painful, but not at all
frightening. 1 was well prepared by the
doctor and other people, and others who
had been through it. He was in an apart-
ment with an unmarked box. I was to
knock on the door, and when it was up
ened walk in, not saying anything. I
was confused about where it was but
I found it by the noise of people talking.
Then I saw a couple knock and walk in
with nothing said. The first day he
broke the mucus at the Cervix and i -
serted gauze soaked with antiseptic,
causing the uterus to contract. lie packed
the uterus with gauze. Then we waited
for 24 hours for dilatation. Cramping
occurred. The next day, the major and
most painful part, he ﬁrst pulled the
packing out. Then he used the suction
machine, which is manufactured in ,

. and cost 31000. It is a white box
with a vacuum pump inside, two quart
bottles on top and hoses coming out.
There are three different size nozzles to
insert in the uterus, depending on dilata-
tion. When he turns on the switch, you
can watch it go into the bottles, About
a cup of blood, foam, and broken tissue
came out. Then he Curetted a little to
loosen it up, and then did the suction
again. I had pretty bad cramps, but I
felt alive again, ecstatic, elated, 1 could
hardly walk, but it was a beautiful feeb
ing. The third day he did more curetting,
wiped the ervix with antiseptic and
gave pen He generally operates
on five people a day."

Girl D “He was in a small apart-
ment building. He moves frequently, and
usually has two places rented besides the
one he’s in, He stays in each place may-
be two weeks. He posed as a distribu-
tor for soap, and even had soap lying
around. He sterilized everything twicc,
first by heat and then cold. Four of us
were staying at the apartment. Different
people came in every morning. of the
people there none of them had any parti-
cular pain. He talked to us about what
was going to happen. He is very relaxed
and inspires confidence. Everything is on
a first name baSls.”

Abortion, Aborlion, Abortion
Girl F: “I assumed i was pregnant
from the start, when 1 found out I re—

Pogo Five

member trying to think of how I felt and
I felt ﬁne. I felt it was important to stay
sane. 1 always kept my head. The only
sense of unreaiity I had was during
those three days when l was just
around people who talked abortion, abor-
tion, abortion.”

Girl A: “I couldn’t stand the thought
of having to get married and have a
kid at that point. I didn't consider it.
There was never any doubt in my mind
about what I was going to do, I couldn't
talk to people about it. It was a very
mushrhiish thing. i didn't really believe
it was happening to me. That was the
only way I got through it. I was franti-
cally running around the library trying
to find books on abortion. They were all
behind the desk. Afterwards I was just
relieved. I was still upset about the idea
that my parents might find out. It took
me six months to stop being over-
whelmed by it. i think that’s primarily
because people just don’t talk about it
and you have to live with it by yourself
and just a few friends. Nearly two years
after the abortion I began to talk and
joke about it, but there was a grear
tension. I’m still cautious about who I
talk wiih about it because you can’t
trust how people will react.”

AFTERWORD: Those who want to do
a little help to change the abortion
laws might begin by clipping this arti-
cle and sending it with a letter to their
state legislators. The law, however,
is not an liberation hut R reflection
of prevailing attitudes and values in
American society. It betrays a deep
misunderstanding of human sexuality,
of the freedom and responsibility of
individual women regarding child beara
ing, of the importance of the quality or
human life Is opposed to ils merely
technical definition.

Like so many of our laws, it bears
heavily on the poor while the rich may
circumvent it. This is not inconsistent
with a Society dedicated to the pro-
tection of free enterprise but not the
elimination of poverty, in ii rising
G.N.I’. but not the improvement of the
environment, to the maximum use of
technology for efficient mass produc-
tion to meet a manipulated, uniform-
iZed mass demand but not for discov-
ering and responding to diverse human
needs and potentialities. Those who
wish to analyze and develop a strategy
to attack these deeper problems will
find kindred spirits in the Women for
Freedom group on campus.

We WanI In

By MOLLY MCGUIRE

The question of student at-
tendance at faculty meetings
remains an active issue on
campus, although no decisions
have been made by the iaculty.
A petition was circulated by
Dan Cheiﬂtz and Mike Brandon
asking that every student be
able to attend the meetings,
drawing signatures troni about
ﬁnerthird of the Student body.

They intend to present this to
the iaculty at the meeting to-
day. (Friday)

Thursday, Brandon along with
Cheifetz who initially present-
ed a proposal to the iaculty,
met with President Leggett to
discuss suggestions to be made
to the executive CounCll, who
will oiier a proposal to the iac-
city.

Stripping Through History

By ALLAN HART

The now legendary Grinnell
strippers may have shocked
numerous Iowans and in par-
ticular their elected represcib
tatives, but the actions at
these students were tar irom
revolutionary, and, amazing as
it may seem to the aioremen-
tioned citizens, they certainly
did not set any precedents ior
obscenity or public lewdness.

According to Dr. Wall, strip-
ping is an old torm oi protest.
He pointed out in an interview
that one could certainly con-
sider the nude ride of Lady
Godiva an authentic protest.
Beiore that, during the Protes-
tant Reiormation, a group
known as the Adamites stripped
in church as part or their ritu-
al, They believed in a return to
the simplicity and innocence of
Adam.

Later on, right here in the
very United States at America,
the Quakers, during the seven»
teenth century, protested perse<
cution or their sect hy the Con.
gregatinnalists by stripping in

public, This to them was thﬂ
ideal iorm oi totally non-violent
expression. Two centuries later,
the Abolitionists of the Congre-
gational Church used publid
nudity as a protest of slavery.

It is important to point out
that in those backward times,
the nude protesters were not
punished tor their acts or strip-
ping; some received, though,
prosecution and persecution tor
their beliefs.

Obviously, only in these mod-
ern times has it become clear
that the crime is in the ex«
posure of the human body,
which is clearly dirty and lewd.
not to mention immoral.

In recent times, a religious
group, the Doukhobors of Can<
ada, have been the cause of
problems to authorities. They
believe that the road it) purity
is through stripping and bum-
ing. The real problem there is
the burning: not only do they
burn their own homes, but en<
gage in bombings of other
buildings and automobiles.
However, the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police use the Duuk—
hoburs' mass gatherings where
the believers strip en masse as
opportunities to make arrests.

No one is really certain who
{irst originated the idea of
nudity as protest, but one of
the earliest records of such a
demonstration clearly shown
that this obscene bodily ex«
posure was a device at the In-
ternational Jewish Conspiracy.
1n the eighth century before
Christ, the Jewish pmiit isaiah
walked the streets of Jerusa-
lem naked to protest his gov-
ernments military alliance with
surrounding it a ti o n s to said-
guard against the Assyrians!

One can draw numerous an-
alogies with present conspin
aeies to the lewd act of Isaiah.
Once again, we find that the
Jews are behind SDS, There is,
though, one important diiter»
ence between the Grinnell strip-
pers and those of the past. The
Grinnellians' method of protest
was directly symbolic or that
which they were protesting _
a great, free enterprise! So, in
the end, we ﬁnd it is not a real
ditiercnce in protest but rather
the difference between Lhe un-
enlightened governments of the
past and the upright otiicials at
today. And, in the end, we
again find the International
Jewish Conspiracy the root at

THE NEW SCHOOL COLLEGE

is the senior college of the New School tor Social Research. an urban university
located in Greenwich village with all of New York city tor its camptis. There
_are three main New School units. One is the Graduate Faculty. at leading center
in the SocialScicnces that otters training to 2 40K! masters and doctoral \tudents
under scholars like Economist Robert Heill’aroncr. Pclltlcal Scientist Saul x.
Padover, and Philosopher Hannah Arendt. A second is the New School evcni g
division. which provides a vast range of courses. workshops, and lectures tor
some 12.000 New Yorkers annually. and serves as a maior cultural center tor the community-at-
laree with programs of concerts, ﬁlms, modern dance and art exhibitions. The newest unit is the

NEW SCHOOL COLLEGE

an undergraduate program, limited In 500 students. The College otters a tworyesr program ior
students who have already completed their sophomore year elsewhere. and who are interested in
earning their BA. with emphasis in humanities or social science, in a program which considers

undergraduate education important in itself.

instead of lectures. every class in the College is designed as n seminar, with about twenty students
sitting around a table to learn through participatory discussion. instead or textbooks. the student
rontronts the actual works produced by great minds of the past and the present—Aristotle and
Sartre. Freud and Eriksont Sophocles and Pintera Marx and Marctise. Shakespeare and Picasso.

cation, the College has a taculty whose primary eommltment is to teaching. and it trees them lrom
extrinsic demands so that they can concentrate their talents on the instructional program. instead
or taking a collection of unrelated courses, stttdents take a Divisional programea set ot courses
designed by the laculty to ﬁt together into a total educational experience, And instead or a t‘ iior."
each student pursues his own Individual Study Program in which he investigates. in con derable

depth and over a two- -year period a problem of his own choosing under the guidance ota

tutor.

The student. takes three year- 10 1; courses during his first year and two year- long courses during

his second. Thi

onstitutcs his Divisional Program. The rest of his time is spent in individual Stud-

ies. which he initiates during his first year and pursues tor halt oi_nis time during his second year.

THE DIVISIONAL PROGRA . Unlike most
colleges. we are not divided into specialized
departments like English History, or Psychol-
ogyi We have only two Visions—the Humani-
ties and the Social Sciences. The entering
student normally elects to study in either the
humanities or the social sciences. but may
choose to work in both.

The Signiﬁcance uf this unorthodox Divi-
Iiondl structure is twotold. It means that the
student takes courses at an advanced level that
are genuinely interdisciplinary rather than nar-
rowly spectallzed. And it means that the student
is free. in the Individual Study portion of his
vrogram. to investigate a problem that deﬁes
the boundaries or conventional departments,
perhaps cittting across philosophy and drama.
orpsychology and economics.

THE HUMANITIFS: The humanities com-
prise all the creations of man—in music, paint-
ing, and literature. in history, science. and
philosophy. Yet at most colleges. a student who
wishcs to study these creations at an advanced
level must limit hinrselt arbitrarily to the study
or a single kind. and even to a single country
or period. There is no “department" at most
colleges that will allow him to major in both
Thomas Mann and Dostoyevskyi bolh Pinter
and Proust. And even when he lirntts his study
to one of these ﬁgurex. the intellectual tools
lhat he requires for exploring the ideas ot that
writer in depth can only be acquired by taking
courses in sull other departmentsepnilosophy
or theology or psychology. Simtlarly. a student
who majors in the conventional Philosophy de-
partment cannot develop. within his specialized
courses, the aesthetic sensitivity that he need:
to penetrate fully the philosophy of thinkers
such as Plato and Nietzsche and Heidegger.
whose philosophic visions are expressed by
means ot image. myth. and dramatic action no
less than by rational discourse. It is for these
reasons that our study of the humanities is inn
terdisciplinary rather than tragrncnted tntri de-
partmental "maiors."

We have designed a set of courses that ﬁt
together into a comprehensive iniestigation oi
the creations ot man. It is possible tor us in
a single course to iuxta‘pose a treatise by Kant,
a novel by Earth and a movie by Godard in
order to deal fully with the problem under lvt-
vestigalion. The emphasis is less on assembling
intornralton about particular works than on
discovering the methods of understanding and
apprectatton that can he applied to rriiy‘workr
The goal is to provide tools of analysts that
will extend the student‘s insight into the hue
manitics when he pursues his own individual
Study.

while research in the social sciences tends to
involve two or more special s simultaneously.

By JONATHAN STEIN

The book store committee is almost
ready to give their iinal recommenda-
(ions concerning next year's Bookstore.
The committee, comprised oi Mr. Moore,
Mr. Parslnnen, Mr. Muchmote, Mark
Kass, Henry Scheft, and Jonathan Stein
will make the following proposals.

The College should conceive of the
Bookstore as a service to the college
community. There is no place within 50
miles of Grinneil where quality books
and periodicals can be purchased and
access to quality books and periodicals
is essential to a liberal arts education,
It is obvious that the college can never
have an adequate Bookstore in the space
now allocated. The women's Gym, when
available and properly renovated, will be
ideal. Until the Gym in available. tha
Bookstore should be located in one oi
the vacant ﬂoors in the oiiice building:
on 5th street.

We are aware that this temporary lo-
cation will be somewhat inconvenient,
but the need of a good Bookstore is so
urgent that the temporary inconvenience
is more than onset by the availability oi
adequate space. .

The committee also will recommend
that texts required for college courses
be distributed irom behind the counter
at a special center on campus. Prear-
ranged bundles of books for Each course
should be made up in advance to speed
up the distribution. It would also he pos-
sible to buy any book singly at the center
but considering that the majority oi stu~
dents buy their books at one time this

plan would speed up the entire operas
tioil.

This plan would be more convenient
ior students, since there would be less
crowding, searching for books, standing
in line with heavy loads, etc. and should
cut down considerably on thettr This
special distribution center would be open
for the first two or three weeks of each
semester; alter this time a few copies
of each text would be kept in the Book-
store for late purchases.

The committee will also recommend
that there should be a standing com-
mittee, probably three faculty and thre-
students, to work with the Bookstore
manager on stocking books and mater-
ials.

The committee strongly recommends
that any student should be able to order
any book at any time through the book-
store. Such is not the case at the present
time.

Quality magazines and periodicals da-
ilnltely belong in tha bookstore.

Students should be hired when opening:
are available in bookstore personnel.

Used books, new and used records.
posters, prints, and art materials will
hopefully be included in the new book»-
store.

The Committee emphasizes the need
for a quality bookstore that will be an
integral part or the intellectual environ-
ment of Grinnell College.

The need for a better bookstore has
existed too long. It is hoped that the ad-
ministration will give the matter top pri-
ority so that R quality bookstore will be
a reality in September.
