Trustees continue
President Search

Edwin S. Hewitt, Chairman
of the Board of Trustees, in a
letter to the faculty this week
reported on the progress in the
selection process for a new
President of the college.

Hewitt reported that a sub-
stantial number of qualified
men have been proposed for
consideration for the position.
The Trustees are engaged in
checking the availability and
qualifications of those nomi-
nated in order to establish a
smaller list of people to be in«
yestigated more intensively and
to be interviewed. The Faculty
Advisory Committee has been
consulted regularly in this pro-
cess.

"Prices are rising astronom-

Palmer Hartl when he asked
the student Senate to approve
an eight dollar social increase
for the 1964-65 financial year.
Hartl also indicated during the
Wednesday night Senate meet-
ing that “the added money will
not increase the program in
quantity, but will allow us to
give the students a quality pro—
gram.”

The Senate voted thirty-seven
to one to approve the increase.
Previously, the C. of H.P. and
the A.W,S. Board had over-
wheln-iingly indorsed the pro-
posed increase; however, final
approval for such a raise in
student fees must come from
the Board of Trustees. Hartl

‘ Generally, on this campus, speakers come and go.
Too many make too little impact on the student body.
They don’t spend enough time here or the students
'don’t take time to see them or their appearance isn’t
publicized because of lack of funds and initiative or
people just don’t care. In the case of Sunday chapel
speakers in particular, the time is short and often in-
effective. The guest spends one hour before‘students,
and hurries to catch the next flight out of Des Moines.
The students have a name on the calendar and a ser-
mon title on the announcement board in front of Her—
rick. Regular attenders go to chapel as usual, others
attend downtown churches, and too many others stay
in bed. Thus, another Sunday sermon is by the boards.

i This week, however, someone cares, Van Spurgeon,
young dynamic campus minister from Oklahoma State
is coming—not only for Sunday chapel services, but
for a two-day campus visit, Students care. Those who
have met Van are excited about their friends, meeting
and hearing him. They know that there will be con-
troversy about what he says, and they look forward
to the discussion that interested students can bring
about. They have kept in contact with Van during the
past weeks. Telling him that their main interest in the
trip lies in interpersonal relations, they have scheduled
a picnic, a luncheon, a panel, and several informal dis-
cussions where students and guest can meet and feel
at ease. They are eager for everyone to hear the Sun-
day sermon so that they might be prepared to meet Van
on a more personal basis later.

Van, too, cares. He wants to meet the students and
to know them. For several weeks he has been receiving
copies of the S & B so that he can familiarize himself
somewhat with Grinnell and her people. To fashion his
service as one completely for the students that he is
seeking to reach, he has made changes in the regular
run of the chapel program. (Three hymns will be sung
by the congregation instead of two, and more respon-
sive reading.) He will be living in a residence hall in

order to make himself available to students at all times
during his visit.

This is hardly a plea to get everyone to attend
chapel this Sunday or any other. Let it serve more as
a notice that people do care about this speaker and that
the speaker cares about Grinnell. Rather than a one-
stand performance, the visit of Van Spurgeon should
he a worthwhile experience for all students.

It seems remarkable for students to say that they
can’t afford the time to hear speakers on Sunday morn-
ing, and then to spend that time sleeping or haphazard-
ly gazing at a book. Perhaps students should learn how
to make time rather than waste it. This weekend you
can afford the time to care.

Letters to the Editor

Roellinger Questions Apportionmnl 0f Concerl Funds ‘

To the Editor:

As a student observing the
aesthetic and cultural aspects
of Grinnell College I would like
to inquire about the reasoning
behind the social and cultural
planning on this campus. Why
is it that Louis Armstrong and
Count Basie play for our formal
dances, While for our (sadly)
one jazz Concert we were
treated to Lambert-Hendricks-
Bavan, and have not seen one
recognized symphony arches»
tra?

It may be some sort of trae
dition to have large namer

bands play for our dances, but
would not the music provided
by a local band more than suf«
(ice, and cost only a fraction
of the amount spent for name-
bands?

What I am suggesting is that
it seems out of proportion to fl»
nance the very best for our
dances, while generally speak-
ing we have m settle'for second
best in the concert ﬁeld, which
should hold priority over
dances in a school such as
Grinnell is supposed to be.

tween the two mentioned types

Miscellany and Digression

By Tom Fullmer

The step taken by the college
last Week to join the city in
switching to “fast” or “day-
light savings” time must be
viewed with mixed emotions.
It is heartwarming to have
proof that some college offir
Cials are aware that there is a
world outside of, the college.

Nevertheless, it is readily ap-
parent that this recent decis~
ion by the college was made in
a highly hasty manner without
proper consideration of the
implications inherent in the
switching of time.

First of all, there is the pure-
ly practical consideration oi the
changing of the clocks. Theo-
retically, before the switch
Grinnell was (in Central stand
ard time. About the! only thing
standard about time at Grill-
hell was that at any given in-
stunt no two Grinnell College
clocks showed the same time.
One library clock was on day-
light saving time three weeks
ago.

When one told somebody the
time he had to be sure to spec»
ify which Clock he was using as
a basis. The United States has
{our time zones. Grinnell has
Well over 30.

But the problem of synchror
nizing the clocks pales to in-
significance when compared to

 

other problems created by the
switch which may well have
profound effects on the sociol-
ogical lives of the Grmnell stu-
dents. .

For example, those couples
who have been dating regularly
are upset because there will be
an hour less of darkness be-
fore women’s hours. They
would have preferred a swuch
to “daylight wasting" or ‘slow”
time.

But perhaps the most signifi-
cant influence the change Will
have will be in the area of
study habits. And here the ei—
fect could be disastrous. For I
venture to say that the normal
student Will tend to use the ex—
tra hour of sunlight lor pur-
poses of recreation rather than
study. As a result, the quality
of Work will decrease and the
reputation of the college Will-
suffer. i

It is still not too late for the
college to reverse its decision.
Some clocks are probably still
operating on standard time.
Some students are. Taverns
and railroad stations operate
on standard time. So should
Grinnell College. Leave us not
be deceived by the specious
something for nothing reason
ing that contends that by using
“last" time we can save day—
light. Humbug!

Anku on Ghana Economy

By Vince Anku

This week I am dealing with
Ghana’s economic policy which
is alleged by some pseudo-ex-
pel-ts to be communistic, Next
Week We shall examine Ghana's
foreign policy.

There are five sectors in
Ghana's economy: " 1) In the
state’s sector enterprises are
entirely state-owned. This in-
cludes such industries as a soap
factory and a jute bag factory.

The railways and airways are
government owned. in addition
to the food produced by small
private farmers, the govern-
ment produces food on 105 state
farms using modern large-
scale. technological methods.
Four of these are run by So-
yiet experts and three, by is-
I‘ael. The Russians and Israel-
is are not to be the only foreignr
ers to help implement Ghana’s
agricultural revolution—a revo-
lution which is supposed to take
place on the individual farms
as much as on state farms or
cooperatives. The U. S. recent-
ly sent over 250 tons oi agricul-
tural supplies, under the U. 5.
technical assistance program,
to be used at ﬁve new training
centers for farmers,

2) The joint State - private
sector is managed by an agree-

ment between the government

and private investors of copL ‘
tal. Ghana's biggest single in- ‘

dustrial project is the $197 mil-
lion Volta hydroelectric pro-
ject, The new dam is being n-
nanced on a littyeiiity basis by
Ghania‘and tullowing sources:

the World Bank, the United '

States and Britain.

“The following information is
condensed from The New York
Times, January 20, 1964, page
67.

3) In the cooperative sector '

the organizations are affiliated
with the National Cooperative
Council. This is more or less
like American farmers' cooper-
atives. Government subsidies
are available it groups want
them. Some breweries and part
oi the internal transportation

system are owned on such a ,

basis.

4) The private enterprise sec-
tor is a segment of the econo-
my open to private investors.
Many hotels and huge departr
ment stores are in this cate-
gory. Another good example is
the Volta Aluminum Company‘s
smelter at Tema, the most
modern and well-equipped har-
bor on the West African coast.

and the Board of Trustees
would view this increase with
favor if t’he C. of H.P,, A.W.S.
Board, and student Senate give
the program strong support.”

After passing the proposal for
a social increase, Senators be»
gan the tedious task of review-
ing organizations' proposed
budgets for the coming finan-
cial year, Jim Parkison, Speak-
er of the Senate, had the diffi-
cult job of providing the Senate
with a sense of direction dur-
ing this long budgetary meet—
ing, Parkison and the Senate
performed admirably; some or
the more important results of
the meeting follow:

1. The Senate agreed with
the Executive Cabinet that
the Social Coordinator should
receive a salary of $200. The
Social Coordinator worked
without pay last year, but it
was felt that he deserved a
salary since he is responsible
for a budget of over $40,000
and is responsible for the oc-
currence of social events
every week of the school year.

2, The Senate deleted 3l,0|)0
from the proposed Gadabouts
budget. This money was to be
spent on a dance, but the Sen-
ate felt that the College could
either do With one less dance
or without a "name" band.

.3. Five hundred dollars was
added to the proposed budget
of the Informal Social Com-
mittee. This money will be
spent to provide more bowling
and pool and to repair the
cabin at Lake Acre.

4. Four hundred dollars was
added to proposed residence
hall allocations.

5. Although the proposed
5,6 A. budget was passed, in
two weeks the Senate will de-

cide whether it wishes to
spend two hundred and sev-
elityriive dollars to remain in

 

the National Student Associa-

tion,

At 9:30. Marllyn Alt moved
that the Senate appropriate ten
dollars and buy pizza for the
body, There was some debate
as to whether the pizza should
be mushroom or sausage; how-
ever, a “special deal” was
made {or sausage pizza and the
august body was without hunger
by ten o’clock.

Oh yes, a car rule resolution
was also passed:

THE GRINNELL COLLEGE
STUDENT SENATE,

NOTING that the student
body has always understood
that the car-scholarship rule
was a conduct regulation, and
that violations of it would be
punished in the same way as
any other conduct rule, and

NOTlNG that college officials
have handled a recent Violation
of this rule as a ﬁnancial regu—
lation, violation of which is
cause for a loss of scholarship
aid, and

NOTING that considerable
confusion still exists within the
student body as to the intent of
the rule and the consequences
of its violation,

REQUESTS thorough review
of the rule itself, in the light of
this iirst year’s experience, and

REQUESTS that the present
rule be clearly defined, with at-
tention to:

a. The consequences of a
violation of the rule.

b, The offices responsible
for the administration of the
rule,

c. The procedures to be
used in handling any violation
or request for exemption, and
REQUESTS that all other col-
lege regulations be reviewed
for areas of ambiguity and Con-
fusion, and that they be fully
Clarified, and
REQUESTS that these Clarifie
cations be made available to
each member of the student
body.

Lewis Talks to

Rights Group.

Wants to 'Free' Negro People

By Cynthia Brust

”Our job is to liberate an op
pressed people," Jon Lewis de-
clared in Herrick Chapel Sun-
day night. Lewis, chairman of
the Student Non-Violent Coordi-
n a t i n g Committee (SNNC),
spoke to a small, very receptive
audience at a meeting spark
sored by the Gl‘innell Civil
Rights Group.

Lewis began his speech by
listing the major demands of
today's N e g r o movement.
These are adequate income. de~
cent housing, adequate educa-
tion, the right to vote, and
equality of job opportunity. He
urged passage of the adminis-
Lration’s Civil Rights Bill, de-
spite its shortcomings, to give
the Negro people new hope and
a renewed faith in America.
Stresslng the important factor
of “Now" in this struggle, Law
is declared that the Negro
people refuse to be patient, and
will not wait until a new elec-
tion takes place. The Negroes,
he pointed out, are much more
concerned with who is elected
Sheriff and appointed Chief of
Police than with who lives in
the White House.

“This movement started with
demands for hamburgers and
theatre tickets," he reminded
his audience. “Now we are, de-
manding the right to vote and
have a decent job." He de-
Clared that the days of a “tea
and cookie" relationship be-
tween White and Negro
where an articulate, well-edu-
cated member of the Negro so-
ciety met with white leaders to
exchange reassurance: of their
“good" relationships are
past. The masses are involved
now, he emphasized, not just
the welledressed, articulate Nee
gm.

Lewis spoke bitterly or urg-
ings to maintain law and order.
”We’ve had order and no law,"

 

he said. ”That order was ‘be
patient.’ We have a mandate
from history, from our fore-
fathers and from God Almighty
to deliberately disturb this or«
der. . . . We must continue to
agitate."

Urging participation by both
Negroes and Whites, Lewis cler
Clared that “we struggle not
against people, but a system.
This is not a war of hate be-
tween blacks and whites, It
must be nonvviolenl." He fore-
sees a community of brother-
hood and love as the goal.

“The only real and true inte-
gration we have in America to-
day is within the movement it»
self. These people are making
life worth living," Lewis de-
clared. He spoke of the Missis-
sippi Project attacking poverty
and deprivation as a major part
of this ”long, hot and discon-
tented summer oi decision." He
talked about this project of
1000-3000 students as a ”non-
violent army," and a combina-
tion between a “domestic Peace
Corps and guerilla war-fare."
This project is sponsored joint-
ly by tour Civil Rights Groups
and the National Council of
Churches. Its major goals will
be education, social welfare,
and voter registration, Funher
information may be obtained
from Jeff Burnham, president
of the Grinnell Civil Rights
Group.

The Whitecaps, women’s syn-
chronized swimming group, will
be holding workshops next
Tuesday and Thursday eve-
nings at the college pool. Start-
ing at 6:30 p.m, the workshops
are for any girls who might be
interested in joining the group
next fall and who want to learn
some of the routines so that
they can practice over the
summer.

Dr. Murray Krieger
Discusses Criticism

By Mark Schorr

Literary criticism has be-
come so complex in scope that
critics of critics, as well as
“mere" critics, have become a
common phenomenon. Such a
phenomenon, Professor Mur-
ray Krieger, surveyed the criti-
cal scene before the Annual
Writers’ Conference last Friday
and Saturday afternoon.

in his iirst lecture, entitled
"Newer and Older Criticsm,"
Mr. Krieger studied the thorny
dilemma confronting the stu-
dent of literature; must he
choose between the older "his-
torical“ and the newer “con-
textual” approaches to litera.
ture?

In his second lecture, entitled
”The Poetic Context and the
Existential C O n t e X t," MI.
Krieger proposed a solution to
the historical-contextual dilem-
ma; he explained the rudi.
ments of his own critical meth-
odology, which is based on u
c o n c 9 pt of metaphor. Mr.
Krieger explained and applied
this method of dealing with lit-
erature in the last Chapters or
his newest book, entitled “A
Window to Criticism: Shake<
speare's Sonnets and Modern
Poetics.”

Mr. Krieger has style in his
approach to lecturing. but es-
pecially writing. We need only
quote from his impressive
book, “The Tragic Vision," to
demonstrate that style. Finish-
ing his survey of modern liter-
ature, he remarks: ”. , . a rich
yield of the illuminating pow-
ers of literature and its recent
criticism: their powers to illum<
inate the high existential cost of
living and our own endless abil-
ity to pay. . u .

,civilians. In combat in part the
‘dire need for medical Care for
these wounded, the US Oper-
ations Mission maintains a hos-
pital in Can Tho, eighty miles
south of Saigon. One of the two
Surgeons working round the
clock at the hospital is Dr.
Robert Norton son of R. Homer
Norton (History). He has been
in Viet Nam since 1962 in the
midst of the fighting.

Can Tho itself is often a tar—
get for Viet Cong terrorists,
and Dr. Norton told Look Maga-
zine reporters_(Jan. 23, 1954),
"Sometimes an entire Village is

Iowans Competing
For Political Jobs

Competition has been opened
{or a program of undergraduate
internships with political can-
'dldates this summer, the Iowa
Center for Education in Poli-
tics announced in Iowa City
this week.

Up to eight fellowship grants
of $500 will be awarded, for a
two-month, full-time work ex-
perience with a political candi-
date or party headquarters in
Iowa.

Only students of sophomore,
junior, or senior standing who
are Iowa residents will be eligi-
ble for the awards, the ICEP
reports. Applicants are ex-
pected to be above average
lcholastically, have a sound
course basis, and present 9 rec-
ord of "active interest and par-
ticipation in the political party
of their choice. Each intern will
be asked to complete a re-
search project based on his in-
ternship, for academic credit.

Application forms are avail-
able from C. Edwin Gilmour
Director of the Program in
Practical Political Education,
In Room 207, Carnegie Hall, or
1mm his secretary. All appli-
cants must be received by the
ICE? by May 8.

 

and make money while people
on the other side bleed to
death."

Graduated in 1952 from Grin-
nell as a member of Phi Beta
Kappa, Dr. Norton went to
Harvard Medical School, where
he was graduated in 1956, re-
turining to Des Moines for his

internship. After four years of

surgical residency, Dr. Norton
entered the US Public Health
Service and volunteered for his
present post. Dr. Norton. shows
his dedication in another Look
quotation: "We’re doing some-
thing vital here. Not just medi-
cally. When a Vietnamese, com-
ing out of shock, sees an Amer»
ican trying to save him the
‘Ugly American’ myth crumbles
a bit more."

As may be expected such a
hospital being a far cry from
its counterparts in the United
States, lacks sufficient facili—
ties. In a letter to the Grinnell
Junior Chamber of Commerce,
which is coordinating the Nor-
ton Fund Drive, Dr. Norton exl
plained some of the need. “We
have piped cold water only.
Our water supply is adequate
at the source but at present.
only the operating room and
the maternity ward have run-
ning water. . . . The means of
heating water is a problem
which I hope you will be able to
help us solve." However, his
biggest problem is linen. Only
postoperative beds have sheets,
and surgical drapes must be re-
used. “Our male and female ci-
vilian wards have no linen at
all. . . . The cots each have
from two to five patients on
them. . . . I do hope something
does come of this (the fund
drive) but I realize how large
an undertaking this is.”

The Norton Fund sponsored
by the Grinnell Ministerial As-
sociation with the Jr. Chamber
of Commerce has a goal of
$7500 to meet the acute need,
which also includes automatic
washers and dryers to aid in
the difficult job of cleaning
linen in such a humid climate.
The Board of Religion and IRC
are co - sponsors of a campus
collection to be taken tomcr»
row in the lunch lines. As Dr.
Norton said to Look, “Some
people back in the States do
nothing but rant about commu-
nism. In a way, we’re lucky
here. We can do something
about it.”

answer to this attack that ac-

Investment Act, Ghana makes
generous concessions to private
investors. It has recently passed
legislation encouraging private
investment. Act 172 of the Ben-
efits Laws to Foreign Indus-
tries includes a tax “holiday"
of up to ten years and gener-
ous capital allowances for use
after the tax “holiday." The
Act includes deductions from
taxable income for scientific
research. It also provides‘ ex-

which produce domestic goods

free transfer abroad of the prof-
its after tax liabilities have
been satisfied. The government
recently abolished the law re-
quiring reinvestment of sixty
percent of all profits in Ghana.
This is the trend Which the Des
Moines Register of January 9,
1964, called the irreversible
trend toward a Marxist state.

6) Small-scale private capital
is included under the workers
sector of Ghana’s economy.
This segment includes private
ownership of small businesses
by shop owners, crop farmers,
tailors, and cloth weavers. A
Communist government would
not allow its subjects to partici-
pate so freely in a mixed econo-
my. The above sectors consti-
tute the economic aspects of
African socialism.

An eye-witness, St. Clair-
Drake of Chicago, made the
following remarks about Afri-
can socialism:

". . . African socialism in
Ghana is .what Nitrumah says
it is, not what Khrushchev or
Tito or Mao or Castro say it is.
There is no Commuinst party
in Ghana and the Convention
Peoples’ Party is not one of the
81 parties which make up the
international Communist move-
ment.

 

All Soviet satellites have his
dissoluable economic b o n d s
which tie them to the dominant:
country. Ghana has no such ties
with either the U. S. S. R. or

China. Less man 10 per cent of
her exports and imports in-
volve Communists, and the
bulk of Ghana’s valuable cocoa
crop is sold in the West.

Since 1960 Ghana has tried
to free herself from the risk of
chronic price fluctuation in the
West and a possibility of suffer-
ing from future depression by
cultivation trade ties with the
East to balance off those with‘
the West. Most of the capital
invested in these major devel«
opment projects is Western.

Canadians— not Rusisans—
are helping to train the armed
forces. and a medical team is
on the way from the United
States to organize a teaching
hospital. No “satellite” would
be allowed to absorb this much
Western technical and {inane
cial assistanCe. . ."

Ghana‘s political emancipas
tion would be meaningless un-
less it brings economic pros-
perity. To achieve this end.
Ghanaians choose, neither com-
munism nor Capitalism. but Af-
rican Socialism.

House

By Ellen Pearce

For those who are complain-
ing about the student-faculty
relations, the staffs of the eco-
non-lics and political science de-
partments have taken a step in
the right direction The Caucus
Room in Carnegie has been the
scene of nickel coffee and in-
formal conversations between
students and professors every
class day morning from 9:30 to
10:30 since last fallr Each of
the professors seems to view
the conversations a little bit dif-
ferently, but most agree they
have been a success for those
who have participated.

The purpose of the coffee
hour is to provide an informal
gemogether for political science
and economics majors and the
professors of those departments
to discuss anything of common
interest. The topics range from
current national and interna-
tional news to campus gripesr
Paul Smith (poll, sci.) sees the
coffee hours as a means of giv-
ing political science majors
more of a feeling of community
and awareness of their field on
a non-professional basis; he 31»
sofeels the discussions should
be used for course evaluation.

Robert Haveman (econ) pre-
fer the coffee hour because he
doesn't like to walk all the way
to the union; besides, “You
know, it‘s nicer when you can
talk to someone." in a more
serious vein, however, both
Haveman and James Magee
(pli. sci.) feel that it is up to
the students to take advantage
of this opportunity. Few stu-
dents have ever given the pro»
gram a try.

Magee sees many possibilities
for the program but'is some
what fearful mat the project
will turn into a concession
stand for Carnegie,

The coffee hour is supposed
to be self-supporting, but i-iaver
man noted that “total cost ex—
ceeds total revenue" Magee
added, “figuring unit cost, total
costs and that sort of thing is
the job of the economics de-
parlment."

As far as suggestions for im-
provement go, Haveman sug-
gested Charging Go a Cup so that

 

a subscription to the New York
Times could be sent to the Cau-
cus Room as a base for more of
the discussions, He feels that
the subjects talked about are
sometimes trite.

Smith suggested that more
women attend.

Student comments had much
greater range. David Burkhold-
or said that he thinks the eco»
nomics department has the best
studentrfaculty Contact and that
the coffee hour Is a contributing
factor. Andy Goldstein said,
“The coffee tastes like mud,
and i've tasted better mud else-
where, But when the profs come
in, it's a hall."

J Thinclacls “SetTliree Records at Drake Relays

By Tom Fullmer

Three Grinnell College track
records, including one from
1935, were broken at the Drake
Relays last weekend. New rec
ords were set by Coach Young’
squad in the mile, distance
medley, and sprint medley ree
lays,

As a roaring crowd of 18,000
watched in Drake stadium Sat-
urday afternoon, Bruce Beck—
ord, with a tremendous kick,
caught and passed State Col-
lege of Iowa’s track quarter
miler Dave Suntken just before
the tape to give Grinnell a vice
tory in the Iowa College mile
relayl

Led by Beckord’s unofficial
147.9 quarter, the relay team of
Beckord, Ron Schachel, Jeri
Langham, and John TePaske
posted a 3:192 time. This put
to rest one of Grinnell's oldest
track records, a 3:195 set in
1935. But for a near fall by
Langham the time might have
been around 3:17.

That same quartet was also
responsible for two other rec-
ords being set. On Friday they
not only broke the existing rec-
ord for the distance medley
relay, they annihilated it. Fin-
ishlng fifth Grinnell posted a
time of 10:20.0 knocking 5.9
seconds off the old record. Led
by their great miler John Ca-
mien, Kansas State of Emporia
won the distance medley relay.

Then Saturday in an invita-

tional sprint medley relay,
which featured such great track
squads as Texas Southern and
Lamar Tech, Grinnell set a new
school record finishing fifth
with a time of 3:291}. The old
record of 15:30.1 was posted last
year. .
Beckord, Schachel, Toni De-
Berg, and Mike Dewitt ran a
1:30.!) for Grinnell in the Iowa
College half mile relay. In the
two mile relay a quartet com-
posed of Paul Patterson, Mac
Winholtz, Rod Brown. and
John Sutton turned in a clock-
ing of 8:06.01

Pleased with the efforts of his
team, Coach Dick Young noted
that the records set in the re»
lays are by no means safe as
much time remains in the out«
door season.

Grinnell College was given
the 1964 Drake Relays honor
award for colleges. Each year
such an award is given to a uni-
yersity and a college who have
had an outstanding record of
both parricipatiton and success
in the Relays.

The University of Michigan
Stadium in Ann Arbor can seat
100,100 spectators. more than
any other college stadium.

honors but he lost in a playoff
to Gene Parr of Parsons and
Walter'Walsh of Loras.

Dave Sellergren shot a 78.
Russ Harden a 79 and Rick Mil-
ler an 82 on the par 70 course.
A thirteen stroke handicap ac-
counted for the 299 total.

ditions, including 40 degree
temperatures, both Risser and
Sellergren turned in excellent
scores against Coe at Grinnell
on Wednesday. Risser's 74 won
him medalist honors, While Sel-
lergren finished one stroke be-
hind at 75.

Baseball Team
loses Two Games;
To Take on Cornell

By Jack Harrod’

Trying to break out of a sell
one hitting slump which has
plagued them most of the sea-
son, Grinnell’s baseball squad
plays host to Cornell tomorrow
in a twin bill beginning at 1:00
pm. Only the first game will
count towards conference stand-
logs.

The Pioneers. who had. ear-

lier shown some signs of being '

a pennant contender in the
MCAC Southern Division, ran
up against two iron»man pitch-
ers last weekend and dropped
all three contests. The losses
moved Grinnell to third place in
the divisional standings with a
.428 percentage.

Harold Wertich of Monmouth
went all 16 innings against the
Scarlet a week ago to pick up
the win in a 7-2 decision In-
cluded in this marathon were
13 consecutive hitless frames by
the Scot hurler. Cal Collier,
last of a trio of Pioneer pitch-
ers. was tagged for the loss.
Both Grinnell markers came in
the first on a hunt, hit batsman,
throwing error and Nick Nonas’
run-producing single.

On April 25th Knox’s Doug
Ziech matched Wertich's per
formance by pitching both ends
of a doubleheader and downing
the Scarlet 471 and ti-q, Again.

' Nonas came through to drive in
the lone Grinnell run with a
base hit following Steve Tilly's
wind-blown triple to'the wall
in right.

In the nightcap the Pioneers
got runners around to third in
three frames but left them
stranded. As in the Monmouth
contest, the Scarlet pitching
was excellent with Denny
Hanssen and Barry Anderson
going the route, but spotty field-
ing gave the Siwash crucial
runs.

Leading the Grinnell hitters
at this point in the campaign is
Dick Ulrich with a $19 aver-
age. Ulrich has also knocked in
6 runs, Nonas. who leads the
club in R. B. l.’s with 7, and
John Sliierholz are both over
the 300 mark.

Pitching, the P i 0 rl e e r’s
strongest department, is headed
by Hanssen who has a 1.24 ERA
and has struck out 44 batters in
his 29 innings of work Hans-
sen, 172 for the season, will get
the nod in tomorrow's opener.
Coach John Pﬁtsch’s other
starter for the duo will be
sophomore Steve Tilly, who
tossed 6 innings against Mon-
mouth and was touched for
only one run. Backing up will
be Anderson, leading the staff
with 2 wms, and reliefer Col-
lier. .

Rounding out the Pioneer's
lineup against the Rams in the
first game will be Collier at.

short, Phil King at third. and‘

For her competitive shooting
Marsha uses a Winchester 52, a

shooter can have and Marsha
already has three of them. in
1960 she received her marks-

expert rating. If she can get in
enough practice she hopes to
have her mas‘ter‘rating by next
year.

Since practicing in the city of

Marsha has to drive thirty
miles to Van Meter, Iowa, to
practice. She usually goes
about twrce a week in the sum-
mer. \

When asked why she enjoys
shooting, Marsha mentioned
travel. Then she said, "We
spend the whole day outside
and just shoot constantly. in
any weather, sunny and hot,

4 Animal Life -:-

By Don Kurasch

‘ First, an important bulletin:
As a result of last week’s edi—
torial in the 5&3 regarding
paths being trodden across
Grinnell's ”green expanses.”
1M baseball players playing on
either Mac or the 10th Avenue
fields are asked to survey the
base paths before getting up to
the plate. It the batter notices
a definite lack of green along
these base paths and ii the bat
ter accidentally gets hit he is
asked to try to avoid runningy
directly along these paths and>
instead should skip daintily
around these bare lanes with as
much haste as the hitter deems
necessary.

in fairness to these consider-

Raw Deal of the Week award
goes to East by unanimous Ile~
cision of the judges. They were
allowed to play four innings
throughout last Monday’s rain
(which constitutes a completed
game) only to have the game
called with the bases loaded
and no outs, just as the rain
was obviously letting up. At
the time they were behind 52.
thus losing to Smith. That
game ls now under protest with WW,
the IM board, as is an old
game with North and Cowles.

The standings haven’t
changed much since last week,
with Dibble and South still at
the top of the animal heat.

,[IeVeIamI and Cowles Win Annual Fetzer
Sing In First Approved ("o-ed Competition

By Susan Taylor

"Children’s Day at P. S. No.
(47" delighted the audience at
the 29th annual Fetzer Sing
last Saturday night in Derby
Gymnasium, and it won the

naninious vote of the judges
or first place in the compet-
itive event. Cleveland and
Cowles Hall, combining their
,vocal talents in me first cored
Fetzer, and portraying their
yague, if so long ago, recollec-
tions of second grade, walked
away with the trophies.

Read and North Younker
Halls, singing “Set Down, Ser-
yant” and ”Legend of the
Christ Child,” placed second in
the competition They opened
the show since North Younker
had the “honors,” after retiring
the traveling trophy last year.
While this chorus may have not
been equal to the Cleveland»
Cowles effort in such things as
audience appeal and original~
ity, they were certainly equal,
If not better, in their arrange-
ments, difficulty, and perform-
ance of the numbers they se»
Iected,

Third place was captured by
ﬂames and Rawson Halls with
the theme “Spectrum of Song."
Their selections included
"Black is the Color," “Cherry
Pink and Apple Blossom
White,” “Green Leaves of
Summer," and "Deep Purple,"

Dressed appropriately for
their roles as second graders,
the Cleveland - Cowles chorus
performed and sang under the
direction of Bill Morian, ap-
propriately dressed himself in
I tux and tails for his role as
school marm, He had some
difficulty controlling the s e
youngsters, but for the most
part, and considering the cir-
cumstances, they were well,
behaved.

There were a few disturb-
ances, however, Little Georgie

 

Buck, attracting his professor’s

attention b e t w e e n numbers, '

found it necessary to leave in
the middle of the perform»
ance, but he promptly returned
so that the chorus would be
complete. Other small disturb-
ances were caused from time
to time by little Firnist Alex-
ander, who had a special line
“What a good boy am I!”
Firnist could not seem to get
his line in at the right: time,
but he was appropriately aided
by “Piglet." ,

A highlight of the perform-
ance of these second graders
was the announcer of their
numbers, Little Dickie Bailly.
Dickie was dressed for the oc-
casion, with little bright red
bows carefully tied in his big
black beard. Though he had to
fight stage fright off and on, he
did a fine job and the numbers
were appropriately announced,

Aside from their second grade
motif in dress and actions,
Cleveland and Cowles presented
an outstanding musical pe »
formance, Their selections i
cluded “Once in Love With
Amy," and Five Nursery
Rhymes: “Humpty Dumpty
Sat," "Little Bo Peep Has
Lost," “Little Jack Homer
Sat,” ”Mary Had a Little," and
“01d King Cowles,"

From the gently lulling "baa
. . . baa" to the crisp staccato
of ‘Old King,” Morain main-
tained excellent control over
the chorus The arrangements
and the musical performance
were very well done, and stood
out in nice contrast to the slap-
stick dress and perlorrnance ate
mosphere.

As good a Fetzer Sing as I
can remember. was my over-
all impression. All three chor-
uses which placed had excel-
lent arrangements, and good
directors, They showed earnest
work within the halls, if not
earnest frustration of all sides,

but they put on a good show.

I hope that the new co-ed ef-
fect will be continued. Group
singing is fun, and the Social
Coordinating Committee would
probably be delighted with the
mixing its provides of neces-
sity.

Then there were the pictures
that the enterprising photog-
rapher had trouble taking. Es-
pecially Cowles and Cleveland
Wouldn't be still long enough
for him to focus, And now the
8&3 is madly trying to run
him down to get a picture for
the paper. . .

The individual singers varied
from the very professional—

who knew what they were do-
ing and their posture showed
itito the first time performers
who tried to look professional
by beating out the rhythm with
their heads. Then there were
the halls with outstanding sec-
tions and those directors who
did so with ”vig-ah," There
were the boring marchinglines
between the numbers, but these
were relieved somewhat by the
pleasant commentary. It was
interesting to watch the town
families with four kids come in.

The show was good," and
those who devoted so much
time to it deserve a vote of
thanks
