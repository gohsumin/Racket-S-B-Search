Union plans

it is likely that filial plans for the proposed new Stu—
‘dcnt UniOn will be made within tlle next few months. Fac-
l‘liy and administration personnel lime been visiting other
ic'lmpuses to see the latest thing- in unions. This, in itsell'.
assurance that student needs are being considered before

the blueprints are drawn up.

But, nevertheless, it seems to us that Grinnell student
(pinion as to what should be included in tlle building has

‘r-ot yet been satisfactorally

polled.

This is perhaps not the fault ol’ the joint strident-
'ieulty-udministrativc committee which is consideling‘ the

lding plans.

We remember ver well

the meager attendance at a

coffee hour during which President Bowen outlined exten-
sively the plans of the college within the next few years i

:- presentation which

included discussion of

alternative

plans for a U11l01‘l.yHO\\'eVel‘, we still feel that the commit—
tee has the responsibility {or determining student opinion
(n the matter and that it has not completely fulfilled this

responsibility yet.

What we Suggest is this:

that anothe ~ more publicized

coffee hour be presented sometime within the next two
weeks. And that the program merely he a meeting of the
uildingplans committee during or following which quess
lions and proposals may be entertained from the floor.
This, we think, will help to resolve the qllestio 5 0t
l 'hether or not to have studysdate rooms in the Union or
ii'heth‘er to build the proposed Swimming pool as part of

the Union or a field house.

Ballinger sees Africa borro wmg,

modifying Western democracy

by Paul Courtright
“When we talk about democ—
racy for the newly emergent nae
tious of Africa, we must ask,
what do we mean‘ by democ-
racy?" pointed out .Dr, Ronald
Balingei- in an interview. ‘

This semester, Bollingcr, visit—
ing prolessor from the Univer-
s‘ y of the Witwatersrand, South
Africa. has been teaching the
course, ”1an duction to the
Study of Afr a," and giving a
series oi lectures on Afi‘icall
problems.

on the question oi the prospect
for democracy in modern Arri~
ca. he had this to. sa We
must remember that democracy
is thc product of essentially
Western 'Etll‘opean historical de-
velopment. Alricans are not un-
conscious of this and are not
unconscious of its advantages.”

lit pointing out the problems
in the new African state and
tire role or democracy in solv-
ing these problems, ’Balllnger
commented, “The question ' is
whether or not commencement
of rapid modernization will ren-
der them impatient of the checks
and difficulties which stem lrom
the basis of tribal societies. a
problem or whether the aspira—
tions of a coastal elite 01‘ a
privileged tribe more exposed
to modern Western technology-
aud education can be reconciled
with the slower moving tradi—
tional pattern of the older so-
ciety. There is also the question
cl how tar the traditional stronge
holds really represent not mere-
1y a threat to material advance
but to the structure or the state
as well"

Democracy in Africa will car‘-
iamly take a dilrei-ent lorm of
development than in Western
Europe and the United States,i
Ballingel- said. "Democracy must
be related not only to the West.

Fl'iedr' h Ducrreninatt's play
“The Visit” will be presented in
Robert's theater on May 12, 13
and it at 3-30 pm. Duerrcnmatt
is a succcsstul Swiss author who
has several other plays to his
credit, though “The Visit" is the
best known of his works.

The play won the

in 1959,

g" had this to say about m .The story of a cold and calcu-

African situatio “Historically
we can see that in Western
societies, the building or the
state and the struggle ior p0-
liticai liberties have grown
side by side: T is only means
that the po ically conscious
Airicaris not in the govern—
ment will have to struggle ior
those liberties at the some
time in some kind oi opposi-
tion group, which has been
the case in many Airican .
states mid still is."

Ballinger conﬁned his belief
in the future or the basic demu—
cratic framework tor Atrican na—
tions, “At the some time, it is
at least likely that the leaders'
of the new states are conscious
of this problem and will wish
to preserve Western political
traditions and institutions ”

lated revenge for a crime al—
most torgottcn, “The visit” is
a gripping drama which holds
the audience in a vice ot iron.

The parts ot Anton Schill and
Claire Zachanassian will heplay—
ed by Al Stanley and Nancy

,Game, Max will be portrayed by

Phil Powell, while Eon Green-
spou and Dave Palmer will give
their renditions of the charac—

will be portrayed by Gail Zivih
and Carol Shaver. Schill's chih
dren will be played
Phelps and Nick Murray. Mike
Burr and John Williams will
take the parts oi teacher and
pastor.

The play is a study both in
the character of individuals in
crisis and oi a mass of people
when contronted by a strong
temptation. A strange play in
many ways, “The Visit” should
prove both enjoyable and pro.
vocative. The play is directed
by Ned Donahoe (drama) and
the technical direction and sets
are by Richard Meyer (drama).

nism in the world and ways
which its spreading may be pr

He expressed concern that

‘of coiiiniunism"—whicli oversha—
dows onecfourth of the world’s

understanding and fellowship
with one another. i

America, he said, has lie— 1

world and has the duty to help

threat, He said‘ that we must l
recognize our responsibility, as i
we are the only power capable t
or defeating communism. We 1
need power, but we also need t
the solid spiritual heliei em~ l
bodied in the etiorts or our

.Iounding iathers to back up l

our powert . i

He said also that today’s po-l
litical situation is the result or1
,our failure to understand the}
nature of communism, citing as
an example Roosevelt’s inter-pro:
tation or Russian friendliness to
mean a change in intentions. H‘e
.rccls that people and leaderst
must understand the communisti|
way or thinking, realizing that

communism is a philosophy or
change, a “dictator of history,’
a philosophy of nhsolutism with
on unchangeable basic plan to
communize the entire world, ale
though its strategies may change.

by Len Calodney

The performances of the world's first 16-foot pole
vaulter, John Uelses, during the pzlst few weeks, includingl
his appearance at Drake, have brought to mind two obser—
vations concerning athletes inhis position.

The first is that once a man has reached a world re
cord status in no event, he can coast along (in this reput —
tion, continuing to get national publicity whether he pro—
duces up to the capacity he once did or not Since the
time of his record-smashing; leaps
meets in early March, Uelses has barely come within 6” of
his outstanding performances on any occasion since that
time.

However, we do not have the man himself to blame
for this, but rather, we should praise him for doing as well
as‘ he has while following-the tight schedule of mcct lifter
meet without let-up placed upon himi

Uelses worked many months to bring‘ himself to the
point of a world mark, but from then on, the demand for
him as a drawing card at relay meets throughout the coun—
try has undoubtedly kept him constantly on the move.
This brings me to my second point which is wondering how
he has had any time to practice specific parts of his vault
in order to remain at the high standard expected of him.

This lack of adequate practice time was probably on
important factor in his defeat zlt Drake last weekend by
George Davies, at top collegiate VilulLeL Last weekend also
produced the world’s second man to jump over 16 feet, a
fellow marine of Uelses’, Lanny Tork.

Now we must wait to discover if the new champion
will be able to hold up under the conditions that will sur-
round him, or if Uclsos will rise to the occasion and prove
his supremacy in the vaulting field by meeting zind defeat-
ing the new leader.

Protestant theology at the state
University ot' lowa School of
Religion, spoke last Thursday on
"Time and Decision" He con-
cerned himselt mainly with a
discussion ot two opposing views
ot time. relating them to the
Christian faith.

Torelt began by considering
the- l\\'o concepts Ol- time: the
linear view and the cosmic or
cyclic view, According to the
latter, he explained, time seems
to repeat itseli’ continuously so
that anything done my be un-
done in the next cycle. This
view is held by most non-west
ern religions, he noted.

blore iamiliar to us is the
linear view, whi h holds that
time is irreversible and even
progressive and evolutionary.
oiir evidence, said Forell,
seems to support the linear
vicw, tor iroin all that man
knows by experience limited
as his experience may he, time
is not reversible.

are both relatively incidental
to thc religions bearing their
names. Christians, on the other
hand, are very much concerned
with the historical Christ.

Christianity, Fore-ll said, is the
historical religion; it is centered
on events rather than ideas. He
used the Apostles creed as an
example. It cites the events of
Jesus‘ life but omits all his
teachings. Forell used a quota-
tion from Altl'ed North White-
head to demonstrate his point:ll
"Christianity is a religion seek i
ing a metaphysic; Buddhism is
a metaphysic generating a roll

said. is the decision by whiclll

The kids sang well and coming
home we stopped ott at several
towns to sing and to plug the
school. One at the girl's fathe ’

No one complained and they:
