SWEEZY
0N REVOLTS

“Communist revolts are now
caused by underdeveloped coun-
tries breaking out of the cap-
italists‘ system of international
aconomics and developing out-
‘ide of it. The real question is
whether the capitalist metropo-
lis will win in the long run and
retain control of the under-
developed nations"

So concluded Marxian econos
lnlst Paul Sweezy in his lecture,
Jon“! Future of Capitalism", in
the South Lounge Monday after-
noon. His credentials for pre-
‘henting the critique were many
and varied. He is a graduate
“(both BA, and Phd.) of Hal'-
yard in economics and a former
member of their faculty, and is
the founder of the “Monthly
Review" a socialist publication.
He is also author of several
books offering Marxian inter.

rotations of contemporary cap-
- lism.

In reaching his conclusions on
the inevitability of revolts by
thud-world nations, Sweezy dis<
Bounced the two prevailing
Mews of the world situation
ﬁnd its economic development.
.11. capitalism as a western
phenomenon. 2. Two types 0!
mmpetlng systems, i.e. capital—

of the third World), and ad-
vanced his own theory of west-
om economic development,

This premised that Western
nations only reached “take-off"
after they had “suckecHn” the

Professor Denis DeCoteau (mu-

escalating into violence.

Davis told the Ski that his
troupe had agreed to do a short
show at 10 pm. Saturday fol-
lowing : Lenox Quartet concert
for $150 plus donations from the
audience.

He said that when he finally
was able to reach Giddins late
Saturday afternoon, he found the
troupe was actually doing a
“major event at a college that
could afford it.”

He said that Social Coordin-
ating Committee members didn’t
tell him that the show had been
rescheduled for 8 pm. Satur-
day until he called Giddins from
iowa City at 4 pm. the same
day.

“We found out that we had a
major Sl'mW scheduled in less
than four_ hours.” Davis ex-
plained. “it takes nearly an
hour to drive from lowa City
to Grinneil, and we were tired,
and we had to eat, and our
stuff was still set up at the
Universtity [of Iowa] and we
had to take it down and pack it
and come to Grinnell and un-
pack it and set it up again."

“We really couldn't be ex~
pected to come on stage fresh-
as-a-daisy." Cohan added.

“We were angry," Davis said,
"and we asked for more money,’

Giddins told the 58:]! he thought
the time settled on was definite-

Georgia Dentel, Activities Coun-
selor and Program Director of
the College Forum, said she
called the Mime Troupe’s San
Francisco office on October 16
to check the time of the con-
cert.

Giddins said he was told that
the troupe’s secretary read the
time Of the concert to Miss
Dentel off of a printed itinerary
as 8 pm.

Miss Dentel later told the
5&3 that she asked the secre-
tary tn tell the troupe that

THE GREAT JEWEL HEIST

PRESIDENT'S PENDANT
PURLOINED

The President's Medallion was
stolen from its case in Hurling
Library early Monday morning.

The thieves, at least one man
and one woman, apparently re-
mained in the library after
closing, and left ' through the
front doors after taking the
Medallion. The night watchman
went through the library a few
minutes after midnight - the
case 'was_still' intact.

At 2:30 amt, the college
switchboard operator received a
call from inside the college, and
a girl requesteld the telephone
extension for the sen' editor. A
few minutes later the 5&3
phone rang, and the editor was
told by a man Lhat "we havt
just taken the President’s Mo<
dallloll." ,

Ten minutes later, the editor
was looking through the locked
doors of the library. The glass
of the side panel, of the viewing
case, which had been smashed
(after an attempt to use a glass
cutter) by the thieves to remove
the Medallion, was clearly vis-
lble.

REPORT

(Editor's Note: The following
excerpts are taken from a pre-
sentatiou by Dr. Robert Have.
man of the report on his Spe-
cial Faculty Commlttee on Edu-
cational Policy and Curriculum
made to members ‘of the faculty
on October 23.)

I would like to make a few
comments about the contents of
the Report and the style oi edus
cation which its recommenda<
tions imply.

Following a rather prolonged
period oi reading and studying
the literature on the problems
of contemporary higher educa
tion and the changes occurring
at other institutions of higher
learning, the Committee gathers
ed data on the operation of the
College curriculum irom the
Registrar's office, alumni, stu-
dents, and the Faculty. on the
basis of these efforts, the Com-
mittee was able to develop a
set of propositions which de-
fined a number of areas of con,-
cern at the College.

On the basis at these proposi-
tions, the Committee made sug
gestions on changes in direction
and emphasis in a number of
areas. After consultation with

The BisG man on duty in thl
Physical Plant building did not
have I set of keys. so the li-
brary was not entered until
3:30 3.111., when the night Watch-
man showed up.

The silver necklace was gone,
and in its place hung a strand
of gumdrops and a rubber scor<
plan. Two dollar bills (to pay
for the broken glass?) and I
poem (see page 11) were also
in the case.

President Leggett was notified
of the loss at 7 mm, and h.
notified the Grinnell police.
Chief Peters and an assistant
took several fingerprints from
the case.

The Medallion was found Tues<
day morning by Mr. Alden. it
had been hidden under a desk
behind the reserve book shelves.
It was r e t ur ll 6 d. somewhat
scratched but otherwisa un-
harmed, to the President.

“Sherlock" Alden was also on
another trail. Working on A
hunch that originally occurred
to the 5&8 editor early Monday
morning, he found a library
book referred to in the poem
left in the case. Written on the
overleaf of the book was the
Dewey Decimal number of an-
other book.

On an exciting search that
took much of Tuesday, Mr. Al<
den unearth a virtual anthology
of poems hidden in books in
the library.

As far as the college ls com
cemed, the case ends with the
discovery of the Medallion. The
police, however, are still search-
ing for the person or persons
who stole the necklace, and

TiiE PAPER AND THE Follllhf

The staff of The Paper, the unofficial student newspaper of
Grinnell College, has been denied permission to distribute Copies
of the October 26 issue in the College Forum.

There are several arguments for barring The Paper from the
registration area in the Forum ~ We find them all absurd.

The primary objection is lack of space, voiced by Mrs. Hawk
and Miss Mary Jones (the Alumni Secretary, who is responsible
for the registration operations). The Soil editor offered to share
his table with The Paper. Permission to do this was denied by
Miss Jones.

The content of The Paper was the next objection. It is obvious—
ly not lit for human consumption, according to the administration
people involved. Mrsi Hawk was reported to the 5&8 as having
said: “I haven’t read it, but I’ve heard about it.” Mr. Hess (pulp
llcity director) said that he’d seen the first issue. The big thing
on Mr. Hess’ mind was the cartoon on the last page.

And, explained Mn Hess and Mr. Avison (development direc-
tor), when Miss Jones referred the 5&3 editor to them for a final
decision, the college has no control over the editor of The Paper.

Let us consider parallel situations ll the editor of the 5&3
displeases the college sufficiently, he can be lired by the Commit-
tee on Student Publications and lose his salary. The present editor
could take the monetary loss easily If, however, the editor of The
Paper displeases the college sufficiently, the only recourse is to
throw him out of school This means a one-way ticket to one of
ﬁcneral Hershey’s “summer schools.”

It seems, then, that the 5&3 editor actually has less at stake
than the editor of The Paper, and thus the college has less control
over him.

There is also the absurdity of this decision regarding freedom
of expression being made by the Alumni Secretary, and ultimately,
the directors of publicity and development. That such a decision
was not effected by the Deans of the college, or by the faculty, is
my amazing.

But the decision has been made.

The 5&1! urges all visitors to the campus who consider them-
Ielves friends of Grinnell to find a copy of The Paper and read it.

You may not like it. You may not even be impressed But a
group of students have taken the time to organize and publish
their ideas, and as people interested in the college, you should
lead it as soon as you would read the 5&3.

If you don’t find a representative of The Paper walking on
campus, drop down to the Sim office in the north end of the For-
um Basementi We‘ll have some copies for you,

TOWN AND COLLEGE

The administration, spurred by complaints from students, is at
last beginning to take steps to curb anti-college and anti-Negro oc-
llvities in town.

President Leggett and Dean Winters are planning to meet
with the local church council and with “Frosty” Mitchell (KGRN)
Ind Al Finder (Herald-Register) to discuss the problem

The S“? wishes to thank the administration for its efforts, but
feels they are in vain, Racial and social prejudice have shown
themselves time and again to be too deeply intrenched to be
reached by the pulpit or by mass media. Such efforts often serve
to further antagonize the antagonizes.

The only way to meet the problem of college student —townie
lelations is head on — with a direct confrontation between the two
groups.

The confrontation may take two fonnsl It may be violent, with
ouch side retaliating for alleged insults received Or it may be
peaceful, with people from both sides meeting to try to understand
oach other and work out a solution

Peace through understanding is difficult, if not impossible,
when dealing with large groups of people. But with a small college
and a small town, it may work. And it must.

The 5&3 would like to see a commission composed of college
ltudents and young townspeople, with college administrators and
parents as observers (not supervisors), established to examine the
problem and propose solutions.

The young people on each side are the one: who stand to gain
or lose, and their direct involvement is the only way to resolution.

NOTES FROM THE
GIRGULAR FILE

The sun would like to apologize for an error in last week's
paper. Quoting the anti-war petition, we referred to the war as
"immoral and a useless destruction of human lives.“ It should
have been “immoral in its useless destruction of human lives.” \

The distinction is subtle, but important. If the story had re-
mained on Campus, we might have overlooked it.

But the information Service, without consulting the editor of
the 58:3, Neil Fischer (the author of the story), 01‘ Ron Miller
:(GSM member who was interviewed), turned the story into a news
release and sent it to the four corners of the earth.

if we’re writing for siicll a large audience, we’d like to get paid
tor it Or at least get a credit. And we’ll get; very careful on our
quotes.

LETTERS TO
THE EDITOR

niiiiilliiiiiiliiiiillitiiilllltiiiilliiiililiiiiiIIiiiiilliiiiiliiiiiilliiiiilliil

I’m not a person who suilics
after the melliiluous praises of
professors. For most of my
years at Grinnell my scholar“
ship has reaped no soft or hou-
eyed phrases; and I don‘t care,
I don't care,

The petty rewards vouch-
safed by the pedant class ~
those insipid certificates, those
maritricious laurels, holds out
no real glory for my desires for
recognition

Miss Wormkee, my third
grade teacher, never puts a
silver star next to my name —
and i don’t care, I don’t care.
Arthur, my six year old broth-
er, laughs at me and kicks me
when i come home from Suhool
because I never receive even
the slightest acknowledgment.
But understand, I don’t care, I
don't care.

What are all these things
next to that quintescenco of
awards -— that necklace of
precious metal and solid wis-
dom. I am privately aware that
in my own scholarship, l have
stood at the head of my guild
during these past few years at
Grinnell. So it has been an an-
nual pain to me to see Grinnell
confer on aggregate of awards
and scholarships upon persons
of small and temporary conse-
quence — persons of local and
evanescent notoriety, persons
who drift into obscurity and are
forgotten inside of ten years —
and never a medallion offered
to me!

What is mere to work for —
nay, to live for if not the Pres‘
ldent’s medallion? And yet, I
would have as unflinchingly
taken the matching earrings
and bracelet as I emancipated
the medallion.

So as not to be dealt that last
blow of ineffable disappointment
when it would be given away
to some charlitnn, some bogus
student, 1 procurred it myself]

Arthur won’t laugh at me
anymore. Miss Wormkce will
really be sorry. And after I
show it to the representative
from Dow Chemical he will
really be impressedl

The possession of this neck<
lace consummates the Grinnell
upenenw.

Attention kiddies! (also parents, administrators, trustees, and
faculty members)

i have finally resolved Grinnell’s greatest paradox, omnipres.
ent wherever people talk about or attempt to analyze this school
— viz., Why the hell do people who have never lived in conserva.
tive Gril'iliell think that this is a liberal school?

Or, more specifically, why or how are liberal, radical (and
therefore interesting) students deluded into coming here . . .
even alter many have visited as prospectives? 1

Because, to the visitor, Grlnnell College must look like a l
perpetual “sit-in.”

Every time you turn around at Grinnell — especially around
Convocation when visitors abound -— you see students sitting
around.

What are they protesting?

Nothing. They are waiting in line for meals. They am!
waiting in line for tickets. They are Waiting in line for regis.
tration. some are just waiting in line to be waiting in line.

Students and faculty members began waiting in lino for Verdi
Requiem tickets at the Forum desk at 1 pm. Tuesday.

The tickets weren’t distributed until 7 pm.

The Requiem line impeded student traffic and Saga and For.
urn administrators' errands (May bands of angels sing them on
their flights!) everywhere from the North Lounge doors to tho
South Lounge music room.

The South Lounge was ﬁlled with ticket—seekers from 4- 3 pan.
Tuesday, piecluding study or TV or anything else. The wholo
thing had the same effect as a “shin"; all normal activity we.
prevented.

By 5:30 pm people In line were ordering pizzas. '

Drawing on Convocan’on, I’d like to make a point about linesti

Sometimes lines have their place . . . like in geometry . . a
maybe . . . and I’m hardly suggesting that we abolish them an,
resort to total anarchy, and all make for the Cowles door at lino.
for late dinner,

But at Grinnell hues are like Chicken Man — “They’re everyu
where; they're everywherel” ,
And they're getting longer. And they’re getting ridiculous.

Students who got up at 5:30 am. Registration morning to get
a place in the front of the line were surprised to find ADO people
already ahead of them. Some pitched tents in front of Darby,
Gym.

1 hope to heaven that these campers didn’t get any of the
courses they wanted.

1 got to Roberts Theatre at 7:30 pm. for the Mime Troupe
lhow scheduled for a pm.

Already three-quarters of the seats were taken — not by,
bodies, but with words.

About every fifth seat in Roberts had an uvaut—ganle automa-
ton sitting in it. About every twenty seconds the automaton me.
chanlcally mouthed: ,

“I‘m sorry, but I'm raving (hm twelve seats for in] t
friends." ‘

The friends, I assume, were home relaxing. showering, enf-
lng, and would eventually arrive in their own sweet time to claim
“their" seats.

Well i have a little announcement to make to those people
— from now on, as far as I'm oonoemed, any seat that doesn’t
have a warm body in it is my seat . . . no matter who’s saving it.

And this week, you even have oonstructive suggestions from
my roommate (they’re not from me, again, because i don’t mk-
nuggestions — I just point out lines): computerize registration no-
oording to student preference, abolish specified hours for meals,
and rule out the saving of seats at events. That's 81L

If you do that, I suppose, we might stop looking like profu-
Iional peace demonstrators and we will stop putting in a per-
petual masquerade.

MAKE MORE THAN LOVE

By PAUL JONES

One of the many results at my previous columns in the 5&3,
ospeclally those concerning creativity, is that I have noticed that
very few people have any sense of the term ‘creatlvity’ as any
kind of broad or Inclusive concept. Most of the criticism or com«
ment that 1 nova received has been to the etlect that "Creativity
is something that just can’t go on all or the time, since it either
takes a special type of person to be creative, or a special talent."
It may be so that it takes both special people and special talent,
biit this does not mean that an attitude of creativity cannot be de-

veloped by everybody on this campus, or that one has to be born
creative to be so.

The fact is that creativity can exist in every kind oi activity
which a person undertakes, from writing poetry to developing re-
lationships with people. As the title or one or my previous columns
stated, “Man is a creative animal.” To be human is to be creative.
to develop a creative attitude toward everything you do. For those
who are willing to take on the burden or being human, or being
conscious at every moment of being conscious, or living actively
and openly, or living with people, not between or among them, or
taking every relationship as an inside activity rather than an out-
side activity, admittedly, life is not easy, or as certain as it might
be otherwise. But a person is not born as a human being, but
rather as a potential human being; You have to struggle, make
choices, suffer agonies of loneliness, to finally gain a soul. not in
the religious or mystical sense necessarily, but in the sense or a
hard and deeply-rooted knot oi compassion. an understanding oi
what it is to be human, a desire to feel as much as you know

Unlortunstely. most people live breastied by their surround-
ings around here, and it not, then in a situation oi animal require-
ments which allow no time tor making choices, At a school like

this people don't really think that they have to struggle; not that
everything is merely given to them, or course, but they sort of live
in a ﬁlm or shadow, never quite realizing, or trying to realize,
what they are doing: not what they will do, but what they are do-
lng.

The ease with which certain individuals {ind categories for
other people and the narrowness of the scales of Values on which
many people, events, relationships, are judged, are only indica«

tlons of the rut into which so many people fall: that of not viewrng
every person as different, as a potential relationship of creative
Value. Perhaps the title at this column should have been: ”Make
more With love, not just love itself.”

(about 1:30 p.m.). We didn’t:

the Chancellor and the Dean to

entered the opposite door from

gone in with the intent to

given the order to clear the
building with force if nec-

surged back to the paddy wagon

donations,”

Giddins told the 5&3 that, al-
though it was against adminis-
trative policy to collect dona-
tions at school sponsored tune
tions, he agreed to let the
troupe take a collection

Rumors circulated Saturday
that the troupe needed money
for the “31000 damage they
caused on the stage at Iowa
City.”

An 5&3 inquiry at the Uni
versity of Iowa round the ru-
mors totally unfoundedr

The Mime Troupe said they
gave up a $1000 pertormance at
Mt. Vernon, 1a,, to come to
Grinnell.

They received some irom the
university or lowa ior two
scheduled performances,

The Social Coordinating Com-
mittee iinally gave the troupe
$300 instead til the contracted
amount at $150.

“We’re sorry it happened,"
Cohon told a group at Ex Loco
Parentis, the off-campus coffee-
house, “and we’d like to come
back. I wanted very badly to
come to Grinneil to play our
show. We just think we were
cheated."

"The rumor is the troupe is
$20,000 in debt," Glddins said
Thursday night “I don’t want
them back, and I think they
were trying to put the screws
into us tor more money.”

“They were just trying to
take us," Miss oentel concluded.

The Mime Troupe pertormed
a modltled version or Carlo
Goldoni’s L’Amant Mililalre, B
"commedia dell’arte” satire re-
directed against the Vietnam
War.

The show began at 8:30 pm
—“The fastest time we ever
made,” mused Cohon.

It would not be in error to
Itate that the Committee, soon
after it began its work, formed
the judgment that the educa-
Iional program of the College
was not in any fundamental
lense drastically outdated or out
oi joint; that. in general, stu-
ﬂents were being educated at
the College and that in many
cases students were being edu-
cated rather well.

On the other hand, the Com-
mittee judged there to be a
number of serious problems can-
!ronting the College. These prob-
lems notwithstanding, the Com-
mittee decided not to construct
I new curriculum from scratch.

This decision was reinforced
by the constant remainder that
the portion of the operating bud-
get devoted to educational pur-
poses inevitably conflicts with
other expenditures, both capital
and current, in the process of
assigning priorities. The Com-
mittee also came to understand
the hard reality that the cen-

this institution create major in-

This year the following rules
are strongly emphasized.

1. Dress shirts are correct at-

2. Ties should be straight and
untwisted, carefully tacked
ii tacks are used.

.White socks are not ac-

i MEMORANDUM

To: The Faculty and Admin-
lstrative Officers

From: Jim Avison

It has come to my attention
Iﬂday that a notice has been
distributed to the faculty (un-
Iigned) indicating what faculty
Ihouid or shouldn’t wear during
lhe coming weekend.

So far as we can tell, this
notice originated with three in-
maie students. it did not come
horn this oiilce or any other
administrative office. I presume
that this is part of the “game"
some atudento an now playing.

Committee Report, while re
commending major overhauia
in some areas and the develop
ment oi new programs in other
areas, only pushes at the mar-
gins and suggests minor adjust.
merits in a number of areas. in
this sense, the Report recog-
nizes that really new curricula
are developed only at really
new institutions.

While it would be difficult to
isolate the most important
changes recommended in the
Report (tor, indeed, many of
them are interlocking). it is
possible to make a number of
generalizations which will cap-
ture the style of education and
faculty and student academic life
which are implied by the curri-
cular recommendations. I will
do this by listing a number or
propositions which taken in toto
characterize the new directions
implied by the complex at Coma
mittee recommendations:

Proposition 1. There is need
for a new and more straightfor-
ward system by which the Fa-
cuity will administer the edu-
cational programs of the College
to encourage experimentation
in educational policy and pro-
vide for its regular review; to
place responsibility for the op-
eration and supervision of the
underciass General Education
programs on the three di sions
of the College through their Edu~
catinnal Policy Committees; to
encourage divisional concern
for programs which heretoiore
have been considered strictly
departmental; to insure the de
veiopment of uniform standards
and practices oi Comprehensive
Examinations and independent
Study.

Proposition 2. The College, and
especially the staff, should re-
new, update, and increase its
commitment to the general edu-
cation of its students. This new
commitment should be re-
ilected in a reorganization of
general education requirements
centered about the divisional
rtruoture of the College, a new
effort to insure that the courses
included in the general educa-
tion program are designed for
the general student and not the
prospective specialist, is con-
scious effort by the administra-
tion to base both hiring and
other personnel decisions on the
need to establish excellence in
these programs, and an exten-
sion or general education into
the upperclass years.

Proposition 3. The changing
abilities and tastes of those
students attending the College

necessitate the provision of in-
creased opportunities tor inde<
pendent library. laboratory, or

studio work, for oii-campuri
study, for indepth study of a
single subject matter during
any particular semester. and
for the interdisciplinary sludy
of subject matters of contem-
porary relevance.

Basic to this proposition is
the judgment that students, as
they progress through the Col-
lege, should assume increasing
responsihilicy for their own
education.

Proposition 4. To compete with
other institutions of higher
learning in the maintenance of
a highly competent staff. the
College must provide an im<
provement in working condi-
tions for the Faculty, Modiﬁ-
cation in the course load is es‘
sential if the Faculty is to ei-
fectively carry out its growing
non-instructional responsibilities
both to the College and to the
respective proiessions.

Proposition 5. The College has
been and is confronted with a

growing departmental and dies
ciplinary orientation of both its
faculty and its students. This ll
reﬂected in both the depart-
mental curricula and the course

programs. it the College is to
remain true to its liberal tradh
tion this shitt in emphasis
should be retarded if not re
versed.

Proposition 8. The curriculum
or the College currently con-
tains too many courses. Now ll
the appropriate time for the
Faculty to re-study the depart-

mental coursc oiierings with
the goal of streamlining the
program of study in each discip
pline.

Proposition 7. The C oil e g a
should consciously institutional—
ize a style of supervised experie
mentation and innovation in

subject matter offerings. tech
niques of pedagogy, and pro-
grams of study both on- and
oiicampus.

NEW ELECTRON MICROSCOPE HERE

By SUSAN EDWARDS

Grinnell has spent an esti-
mated $8,000 for a used piece
or equipment which has to be
stopped each time the train
passes.

An electron microscope, to be
used by the science depart»
ments, was installed September
25, and is in use now.

Dr. Guillermo Mendoza and
Dr. Waldo Walker are the two
biology professors working with
the “highly-sensitive, finely cal-
Ibrated instrument" which, ac:
cording to Walker, is easily
thrown off by Vibrations.

Walker just completed a year
of research and work with
electron microscopes at the
University of British Columbia,
Canada. Although the micro-
scope was purchased from Har-
vard University in August, 1966,
installment was postponed until
Walker returned since he is the
only person who knows how to
Ilse it.

Grinnell’s microscope was
purchased for less than half of
its original price of $36,000.
The price of the newest model.
according to Walker, is around
$45,000.

Workmen have been busy
since this July preparing three
rooms in the basement of the
science building. Besides the
room for the microscope itself.
there is a special preparation
room and a darkroom.

A light microscope uses vis-
ible rays to reflect through the
section and magnification lenses
to “increase" the size for the
viewer. Maximum magnifica-
tion then is limited by the wave
length of the light and rarely
exceeds LOOOX.

Up to 500.000X is possible
with the electron microscope.

Larger resolving power. the
ability to discern two close
points clearly, is only possible
with shorter wave lengths, such
as electron beams.

The direction of the beam Ii
regulated by electromagnetic
lenses as contrasted with the
objective lenses of the light
microscope.

Walker noted, "The electron:
pass through a section and art
partially blocked by the vary-
ing densities of the section. Con-
sequently, thicker parts appear
lighter on the screen. The dark.
and light areas are reversed,
though, alter a photograph is
taken."

An advantage of the electron
microscope, noted Walker, "is
the ability to work in areas
other than biology, such as with
crystal, metal. or ceramic
structures."

“The involved preparation and
cutting are disadvantages. A
special instrument and light
microscope are necessary to
cut and embed the section in
hard plastics. Decompos‘on
prevents reuse of the section."

Students and faculty meme
bers will be using the micro.
scope for independent work and
research.

“It’s here as a teaching re-
search tool for anyone especial-
ly interested in cytology. Hope-
fully the research will be pub.
lishable." added Walker.

"Dr. Mendoza and I are hop-
ing to receive a National Sci-
ence Foundation Grant for a‘
program next summer. A few
interested students would 114
ceive $60 a week and credit
for their research."

“If the grant does not ma-
terialize, students may still
work for credit,” Walker com
eluded.

“We will work with any in-
terested students and faculty
members in learning the funda-
mentals of the instrument. Grin-
nell, though, is too small a
school to be able to afford a
course in electron microscopy,"
he said.

 

LAB NOTES

By DARCY KELLEY,

Science professors and science majors seem to spend an inor-
dinate amount of time in the laboratory. Too many students, strug-
gling through the mire of the science requirement is bad enough.
Spending any more time than necessary in the laboratory seems a

sure sign of incipient insanity.

Behind the doors of the science building, in the rafters or
Goodenow, something is going on. Grant proposals are written. re-
search papers are submitted and independents are perpetrated

upon the unwary department,

Rejecting, for the moment, the insanity hypothesis for sciens
tists, we can seek other inspiration for these laboratory denizens.
Electrons can excite. compounds can compel, fishes can fascinate
and even rats have something to “say" if approached in the right

fashion.

Grinnell shelters much faculty and student research. What is
happening and why? Answering these questions will be the object

of Lab Notes.

The greatest of all jazz solo-
ists, Louis Armstrong and his
All Stars bring the best in show

business to this year's home
coming dance. Beginning at
9:30 pm. Saturday in Darby
Gymnasium, Armstrong will
play dance music and a short
concert in the middle of the eve
ning.

Playing with Armstrong are
Tyree Glenn, trombone and
~vibes; Joe Nuranal, clarindti]
Arvell Shaw. bass; Danny Bar-
celona, dnlms; Many Napolean,
piano; and Jewel Brown, a new
guest vocalist.

The following. taken from
The New Edition of The Erl-
cyclopedla of Jan by Leonard
Feather, best expresses the per-
sonal life history of Louis Arm-
strong.

Born in New Orleans on July
4, 1900, Louis‘ singing career
began several years before he
started to play. When he was
about seven, he and a group of
iriends would sing in the streets
for pennies and nickels; he re-
calls that he always enjoyed
singing, for pleasure and for
money, Then on the night of
December 31, 1913, he celebrated
by running out in the street and
ﬁring a gun he had borrowed
from his mother without her
knowledge. Arrested and sent
to the Waifs' Home in New
Orleans. he was given a comet
to play in the lnstltution‘s band
and soon was playing picnics
and parades, studying his horn
with Peter Davis of the Waiis‘
Home,

Alter his release from the
home he worked in a variety
of jobs and was befriended by
Joe (King) Oliver, who was his
sole musical influence and men-
tor. Later, when Oliver was
leading his own band in Chl-
cago, he sent for Louis to join
him as second cornetist, in July
1922. By this time Louis had
had considerable experience in
Oliver's previous job as a mem-
her or the Kid 0ry band.

It was in Chicago that Arm-
strong, who had been married
briefly in New Orleans to Daisy
Parker, met Lilian Hardin, Oli-
.ver's pianist, who became the
second Mrs. Armstrong. Louis,
then working with Lilian in Ollie
Powers' Dreamland band, left
to join the Fletcher Henderson
band in New York. After an ex-
tensive road tour with the hand
through the spring and summer
of 1925, Louis left to return to
Chicago and to Dreamland,
where Lil now had her own
band.

Early in 1926 Louis joined the
"symphonic jazz" orchestra of
Erskine Tate at the Vendome
Theatre. A few months later he
began doubling in Carroll Dick-
ersun's orchestra at the Sunset
Cabaret. where he was billed
as “Louis Armstrong, World‘s
Greatest Trumpet Player." The
proprietor of the Sunset was
Joe Glaser, who for almost all
of the past 30 years has been
Armstrong’s manager.

It was during this period that
he began to make records
under his own (Louis Arm~
ltrong's Hot give or Hot Seven);
his first tune he‘reoorded as a

By KATHY SHEA

leader was “My Heart.” From
then until December, 1928 a ser-
ies of classic sides was re-
corded, most of the later ones
prominently leaturing Earl
Hines, the pianist with whom he
had worked in Dickerson‘s hand.
These were the records that
earned Armstrong a world-wide
reputation. By 1929, when he re-
turned to New York, he was
the ldol not only of the Negro
public that had known him for
several years but also of white
musicians and fans at home
and abroad. His technical iacii<
lty Was exceptional; his limited
reading ability had improved.
Most important, the emotional
intensity and basic simplicity at
his solos, especially when he
played the blues, had no paral<
Iel in jazz.

Back in New York, Louis
fronted the Dickerson band at
Connie's Inn in Harlem and
doubled into a featured role with
Leroy Smith's band in the re-
vue “Hot Chocolates" at the
Hudson Theatre on Broadway.
It was in this Show that he
introduced “Ain’t Mishehavin’,“
his first popular-song hit per-
romance.

This was the pivotal point in
Armstrong’s career. From this
time on he fronted a big band,
and used popular songs rather
than blues or original instru<
mentols for his material. Most
of the large orchestras Louis
fronted from this time until 1946
tell for short of his own musi-
oel standards.

Meanwhile. the phenomenal
reception of his records over-
seas Ied to his first European
trip. in June 1932 he was head-
lined in the Show at the Lon-
don Palladium. it was during
this visit that the editor of the
London “Melody Maker,” un<
wittingly gave him his nick
name “Satchmo” by garoling an
earlier nickname, "Satcheh
mouth."

ln 1936 Armstrong went to
Hollywood to take part in the
film Pennies from Heaven with
Bing Crosby. During the next
few years, his transition from
the status of musicians' ldol to
that of personalityrentertainer
saw many changes in the mat-
ter and manner of his presem
rations. His singing played an
increasingly dominant role. The
greater his impact on the pub-
lic, the less important were his
musical settings and the less
durable his musical contribu-
tlons.

One of his rare opportunities
to appear before the public with
a small, improvising jazz group
came in 1944 when, celebrating
his first Vlctory in the “Esquire"
poll, he appeared with fellow-
winners in the first jazz con<
cert ever held at the Metropol-
itan Opera House in New York
City,

ln1957 after acting in the
film New Orleans, Armstrong
took his place at the head of
a sextet featuring Jack Tea‘
garden, trombone; Barney Bl-
gard, clarinet; Dick Cary, piano:
Sid Catlett, dnlms, and Arveil
Shaw. bass. This belated use of
a small group was an im-
mediate success and he made
it his permanent setting.

The mounting interest in Ann-
strong as a symbol of Ameri-
can jazz led to more frequent
appearances abroad.

Armstrong during the 19503

enhanced his reputation in the

popular music held through re«
cordings with elaborate orches-
tral settings including large
string sections, under the db

, rection of Gordon Jenkins, Russ

Garcia, and others.

Through the years, Armstrong
has had major comedy parts
in various ﬁlms. A film and
record commemorating some of
his travels, entitled Satchmo
the Great were released in 1957.

Louis has appeared at New-
port and most of the other ma-
jor jazz festivals. He has won
”Down Beat" and "Melody
Maker” polls among others.

It is difficult, admittedly, to
see in correct perspective Arm-
strong's contribution as the first
vital jazz soloist to attain world
wlde influence as trumpeter,
s i n ge r, entertainer, dynamic
show business personality and
strong force in stimulating in-
tel'est in jazz. His style, mel-
odicaliy and harmonically Sim<
ple by the standards of later
jazz trends, achieved in his
early records an unprecedented
warmth and beauty. His sing-
ing, lacking most of the tras
ditional vocal quailtles accepted
outside the jazz world, had A
rhythmic intensity and guttural

charm that induced literally
thousands of other vocalists to
imitate him, just as countless
trumpeters through the years
reflected the impact of his
style. By 1960 Armstrong, set
in his ways, improvised com-
paratively little; but he retained
vocally and instrumentally many
of the qualities that had estab«
lished him, even though enter-
tainment values, by his own ad-
mission, meant more to him
than the reactions of a minor~
ity of musicians and specialists.

The best recording demonstra-
ting his early years can be
found in the four-volume “Louis
Armstrong Story" on Columbia
available in Burling Library.

Leonard Feather's Encyclope<
the of Jazz in the Sixties com
tributes additional recent In-
formation.

During the 19905 Louis Arm-
strong became more than ever
a symbol of the basic beauty,
simplicity, and international ap-
peal of traditional American
jazz. In 1960 he Visited Africa,
in two separate tours, one spon-
sored by a soft drink company.
the other by the U, S. State
Department. In 1961 through
1965, he toured Europe, Asia,
and Australia. During his 1965
tour throughout Eastern and
Central Europe, Armstrong
played belore an audience of
Baooo in the Budapest Football
Stadium.

After several years at cords
parative quiescence as a record-
ing artist, Armstrong came to
the forefront in .1964 With the
release of “Hello Dolly”. The
best-seller both as a single, and
record became a phenomenal
in an album. The success of the
song, according to its composer,
Jerry Herman, was due almost
entirely to his gruff, globally,
imitated style, During the next
two years he concentrated more
on his voice than his horn, but
retained the brilliance and pull-
ity of tone and the gently syn.
copated manner of phrasing,
marks Of his work, since the
first classic Hot Five records
of the late 19205. -

CRAZY MAN

(Editor's Note: The follow-
ing story was sent to the 5&3
by 1967 graduate Steve shen-
der, who telt that “Grinnell
shouldn’t have to wait for the
Des Moines Register.”)

By STEPHEN R. SHENDER

Let me tell you about ML
Allard Lowensteln. There are
probably any number of selt—
styled, hard - nosed political
pragmatists who would be
quick to label Al Lowenstein a
crazy man. Mr. Lowenstein is
the chairman at a group called
the Concerned Democrats who
are currently in the process of
creating a national organiza
tion to deny Lyndon B. John
son the Democratic presidential
nomination In Chicago next
summerl They have no money
and no candidate, but. nonethe-
less they believe that they can
topple an incumbent president
who has at. his disposal all of
the resources of his ofﬁce as
well as control over the nation-
al party organization. This is a
clear-cut case of Insanity if
there ever was one.

Allard Lowerlstein made a
brief appearance here in the
citadel of American academia
to explain himself the other
night. "The worst thing we can
do right now,” Mr. Lowenstein
exhorts, “is to do nothing. If we
let ourselves be overcome by
despair and tatalism at the
very outset, then of course
there is no hope.

“Sure, we’re broke and lead-
erless right now,” Lowenstein
cheerily admits, “but on the
other hand, look what happened
in ’52 and ’56. We had lots of
money, a poweriul organization,
a great leader, a good cause,
and we lost. The mood of the
country was against us both
times, but the reverse is true
today Anybody who can read
a poll can see that public sen-
timent is going against John-
son — and that’s without any
visible altematlver The [act is
that there are a helluva lot of
regular party members who

would like to see somebody else
nominated in 1968, but who at
the present time are so frag-
mented and leel so isolated that
they see no chance in open op-
position. Sure. they’re not all
against 1 oh n s o n because
they’re intellectually opposed to
the war, but they do feel in
their bones that LEJ is going
to have the same impact on the
local tickets in 1968 that Gold-
water did In 1964, and they don’t
want that. These people have to
be mobilized; they have to be
put in touch with others who
think similarly; somebody has
to show them that they aren't
as much alone as they think.
We Can do it, and if we do
that, we Can heat Johnscnt"

Lowenstein pauses while the
room catches its collective
breath. Any minute the Har-
vard police are surely going to
come breaking through the
door with a straight-jacket.
The crazy-man grins and con.
linues. “D.K., so we don't have
a candidate yetl Well, there
was only one man around in
1952, and look how things open-
ed up when he heat the incum-
bent in New Hampshire. The
point is that you can’t realis-
tically expect the established
figures in the party to declare
themselves openly against the
party-leader and incumbent
president at this stage oi the
game. in eiiect, they’re all
trom Missouri; they have to be
shown. Show them that Johnson
can be defeated in a couple of
early primaries, capture some
state convention delegates ior
a peace ticket, in short, show
them that Johnson is a loser
and that his policies are un—
popular with the rank and file,
and believe me, by May there
will be no dearth of candidates
seeking the job

“But let’s get this straight.
We aren’t going to accomplish
anything by tearing our hair,
rending our clothes, and rolling
in the dirt If we give up now,
crying, ‘we’ll take anybody but

SCARLET AND BLACK

Johnson — even a Republlcanl’
we’re liable to get anybody —-
including Nixon or Reagan.
That is hardly an improvement.
As I have indicated. the situ-
ation isn't as hopeless as it
seems. It will take a great deal
of time and ellorL and organi-
zation at the local levels, but
I think it Will pay off. And one
more thing. What we’re pro
pusing to do here really tran-
scends the war and the per-
sonality or the president. We
are engaging in a reaiiirmation
of the viability of the electoral
process. If we succeed, then
we may also succeed in Cone
vincing those who have opted
ollt of the system in despair to
come back into the fold; we’ll
actually be promoting the long-
range stability and viability of
our society. If we tail, well,
things really can’t get much
worse.”

"thus sayeth Allard Lowen-
stein. Uniortunately tor the
poor man, his delusions don’t
stop at the eastern seaboard.
His madness has led him prose-
letyzing all over the country,
and the really crazy thing about
It is that. he keeps finding more
poor souls afflicted of the same
madness — people like the lo-
cal cnmmitteemen in Michigan
and Wisconsin who are now or-
ganizing to beat Johnson in

their state primaries or state ~

delegation conventions, people
like the local party activists in
West Virginia or the “ﬂower-
hatted” matrons at the Mazoo«
la County (Montana) Democrat-
ic picnic, people like the crazy
men out in Caliiomia who call
themselves the C.D.C, He has
even, he claims, turned up
“several” Democrats in Iowa
who would like to see the res-
cal turned out. These people
aren’t wide-eyed collegiate lib-
ersls or pot-happy hippie radi—
cals, These people are good,
solid, churchgoing, moderate,
middle-class Democrats. Bring
them out of hiding, says Low-
enstein; give them a focal point
for their opposition; make them
believe the impossible can be
done, and by God, they’ll do it.
Crazy, man.

WE’llE BEEll Willilliiiroli THIS?

ly DON MARQUAIDT
and PAUL TICI

Tho l2upaga document it
oeiitly complaied by the Faculty
Educational Policy and Curri-
culum Committee represents a
year's concentrated effort by sin
(eight, including the air oliicio
members) or Grlnnoll’s most
dynamic and most respected
Uducators. it is truly a sham.
that the document does not ro-
llect their dynamism.

Their Report, granted, sug-
gests improvements in the di-
vision stincture, underclass ad~
vising system and upperclasl
studies and independent proj-
ects—out all these represent
modifications or the present
stains quo. in fact, this appears
to be the Committee's goali/
continuing what it considers a
curriculum “viable, moderately
puccessiul, and sustained by
tradition. . . (p. 23"

No when did they over at-
tempt to conceptualize the ideal
education that Grinnell College
could oiler, or even what a
“liberal education" should be.
This Report provides no unity-
ng concept toward which fu-
ture improvements can be made
In the curriculum; it only sup-
ports indeﬁnite extension of tho
giesent policy. We feel that a

ncentrated effort should be
made to radically improve the
oliuation lrm‘n a mediocre, "vi-
able" curriculum to a model
our-riculum of which the Grin-
neii community can be proud,

We feel the goals ior an ad
ucaiion at Grihnell should be
ihar ii (i) recognize that it is
dealing with individuals who do
not have the same backgrounds
pr interests, (2) he liexible, llh-
yral, and personal, satisfying
the interests of the individual,
ﬁnd (3) introduce the individual
to the broad themes and major
concepts of all areas of study
in some degree of depth. The
Report's objectives however, ap-

ar to be in direct contra-
diction to these goals. By the
second year; every student will
have been forced to take seven
lecture co u rs e s from wh‘ h
"there will be no exemption.“

so lacturo course: and ro~
uirements ar- not only "difﬁ-
cult to Ital " and a “sacrific-
to tho disciplinary prestige (p.
28)" by tho Committee’l own
admission, but thay are (1) re-
strictive to those students with
exceptional backgrounds or in-
uresu, (2) too large to be per-
sonal, and (3) too general to ba
oi interest to the prospective
major and too vague to be of
interest to everyone else. Largo
lecture classes, as requirements,
are most inappropriate to tha
image of a small college whose
most valuable asset is the op-
portunity it provides for small
classes and seminars that allow
tor meaningiui discussions with
prulessors well qualiﬁed in that
area,

The Report advocates that
lectures . i should take ad-
vantage of the special quai"
cations of the individual [acui-
ty member (pr 42)." Our ques~
tion is, why not have all courses
take advantage of the faculty's
qualifications? These hioad sur-
vey courses are not only in-
ﬂexible and impersonal to the
students, tut they are a gross
misuse of valuable iaciilty ra-
sources. Would it not be ad
vantageous to the entire collego
community to replace the einst-
ing underclass requirements with
a general requirement oi at
least 18 hours in every division,
and allow the individual student
in develop his own program?
This would (1) allow the stu-
dents to satisfy their own in-
terests as best. belit their in-
dividual backgrounds and edu-
cational goals, (2) fulfill the ob-
iectives of a flexible, liberal,
and personal education, and
(3) permit the i'aculty to teach
courses, ii not in their im-
mediate fields, at least in their
own departments and the
courses for which they are most
eminently qualified.

It is also most regrettable that
the Committee did not consider
any fundamentally new con-
cepts in education important
enough to make any proposals
along these lines. Their objecs
tlvcs at encouraging “study
in interdisciplinary subject

matters,” developing "a con-
cern for problems," encourag-
lng "exploration of study and
career options,” and providing
"the basis for meaningful par-
ticipation: in programs or on-
campus study, summer intent-
rhips, iield work, and workshop
study to, 52)" are excellent—
but without deiinito proposal:
by the Committee, they lacs
unfortunate delays.

The Committee's concern for
the teaching load oi the faculty
is certainly a valid concern, but
Grinnell can not afford to saw
rifice the ideals of a modem
liberal education by maintaining
large lecture classes and
disregarding new educational
ideas.

We see no other way that
Grinnell College can claim to
be a progressive liberal arts
institution. Certainly proceeding
with the status quo will never
improve the situation,

The law says that we are responsible
For every bad thing that we do;
But college oliicials in lawn

Are taking a much diiierent View.

It seems that they think we are morons

Or spoiled and irrational brats

When they condescend to have words with us
Our discussions are kindergarten chats.

Kindergarten Chats, Kindergarten Chats

How does one converse with the young?

These kindergarten brats will show you where it’s at
But first, we’ll have a little iun,

(In case you might be anguishing
Over where the treasure's languishing
The necklace made of sterling

Is somewhere here in Hurling.)

s or a

In Humanities we learn very much about Hell
And how it applies to our life at Grinnell

But imagine, if you think you’re not doing well,
Spending Thirty Years as President or Budmell.

a t is

I’m pleased to announce the Foundation of Ford
Has given Grinnell still another award

To research a field in which they know most

(At a school like Grimell, that’s no idle boast)
The stipend is worth seven thousand (no, wait —-
1 think Henry said that he might give us eight)
To be spent in a field in which we're well-knownli
In Victorian Studies. Grinnell stands alone.

u a o

A peculiar game at this college

1s discussing in loitiest tones

Not the advancement of knowledge
Instead it’s the search for unknowns.

We call it a search for ‘community'
Paul Goodman has said it exists
To foster the myth ot a unity;

We iind it not hard to resist

Sn ihereiore let’s not say community

It's a Quest or the Infinite, not

Too real in this state of disunlty;

Glenn, be happy with that which you’ve got.

a a t

In the evening when the sun goes down
hurling Basement lights are burning bright
It’s the twilight people in their twilight world
Plotting how best to wield their might.

People at the Twilight, People at the Twilight

They’re not true teachers, but they hate students, too;'
People of the Twilight. denied the glow of Tmth's light
Be careful when you pass them, they may be cursing you.

Thanks to the Deans, we now all know

About LSD and why poppies grow

But it the narcotics boys only would try,

They’d soon learn the secret or how we get high
The hares think we smoke marijuana alone
Would they be surprised ii the real truth were known!
A trip is so easy if you know where to look,
Try Burling and ask for the Mushroom Book.
In the beginning came J. B. Grimell

A young man hound westward we know

His journey was shortened, he rested a spell

In mid-Iowa long long ago.

And he founded a college that still lives today
But J. B. would Cry if he saw

l-low modem Grinnellians are turning away
From the concept 0! God’s divine law.

0h, sad, how we‘ve renounced religion
Congmgaiionalist Grinnell, God, is dead;
We have strayed from the field of believers
And become Godless pinkoes instead.

a i- o

Peaceful are the tree-lined streets
As we. walk through the square;
Silent are the iolks we greet

To see their hostile stare;

Painful are the wounds we feel
When assaulted in the night;
Hated are the ones who steal
And think that it’s all right,

l’m sure you know it well
rm speaking of Grlnnell
For violence in the streets
Chicago can’t compete
New York, despite renown
Cannot match our Town.

s s c

We wonder when the daylight is fading

what our upright leaders like to do;

Do they just spend their evening hours evading
Problems like the Annex, Pit, and Zoo?

And it they try iorgetting, how‘s it done?

Watching Peyton Place upon their TV screen?

i think their leisure’s spent in having fun

Vicariously thinking Lay Thoughts at a Dean.
r u e

Grinnell is a college that’s said to be so ﬁne

The prois are enlightened, and we grow ivy vines;

The school‘s reputation's made academically;

We wonder why you’re spending so much on P.E.

It’s clear that the students are not the Phy. Ed kind

Instead oi playing tennis, they’d rather blow their mind

The class of 61 was hardly too athletic

The showing or the varsity is pretty near pathetic

So why are you building a temple to gymnastics?

When we‘d rather be known as Senior in Scholuties.
- u o

It’s said that the Deans are the Victorians

But I’d like to say a word for Mr. Alden;

Though Candy and Lolita are bestsellers

He'd only let us read such things as Walden.

Though books by D, H, Lawrence are called classics
They can't be sent to us by US. Mails;
Arriving, they are hidden in the ofﬁce
Where asking for them makes a student quail.
We advocate a reconsideration
or what we lhink is Burling's tragic ilaw
We'ask that you digest the information
Relating to Pornography and the Law.

for my column which will dis-
cuss Volleyball and the liberal

I have been forced to endure
a great deal of antagonism to

pressed in this column during

great moral conviction and ob-
livious to possible retribution,
I would like to take this op«

BELOIT
BLANKS
GRID ERS

For the first time in two years
the Scarlet and Black griddel‘a
have been shut out, Beloit topped
Grinnell 234) last Saturday in a
game played without the Plan
neer's r e g u i a r quarterback,
Doug Fink. Doug spent the day
on the bench because of a dish
ciplinary infraction.

The game was primarily a
defensive one as Grinnell was
held to 38 yards of offense.
Beloit was limited to 234 yards
which was one of the top de<
fensive performances by the
Pioneers this year. Actually the
Pioneers rolled up over 100
yards of offense on the ground
but this had to be subtracted
from the total lost when the
quarterback was caught behind
the line while attempting a pass.

Tomorrow is the last home
game for the Pioneers this
year. It will be played against
Monmouth in front of an ex-
pected capacity homecoming
crowd. Fink is expected to be
back in action for the Monmouth
game.

The Scots have been a sun.
prising team this year. Two
weeks ago they pulled a big
upset by beating Ripon, 14—7.
Their record is 3-2 compared
with Grinnell's L4 record.

This is also a career record
for Doug. Other finishers for the

THE lilthZER

When South say the dummy
of his four Heart contract he
could count five losers: one
spade, two diamonds and two
clubs. He could throw one of
them on a spade honor but he
would still have four losers for
down one. His only chance
would be to force a defender to
give him a Siuff and a ruff, so
he chose “the play to make,"
and assumed that he would get
a “best of all possible worlds"
distribution in clubs and hearts.

The opening Spade Jack was
covered by dummy's Queen
which was taken by the Ace.
The Queen of diamonds was re-

turned and allowed to hold. West continued with the Jack of dia-
monds and South put up the Ace. Declarer then entered the board
with the heart Jack and played the spade King shifting the
remaining diamond from his hand. Dummy'l last spade was then
ruffed in hand and the board reentered with the heart King. Dum-
my’s last diamond was then ruffed in hand and South was ready

to execute the endplay.

Trump had been pulled and both the North and South hands
were void of spades and diamonds. If South could induce one of
the defenders to lead a spade or a diamond he could get ii ruff
and a slufi. Declaror laid down the Ace of clubs and if West had
followed with the deuce, the contract would have made, but by this
time West had counted down South's hand. .

West knew that South had two other clubs and that the Queen
was probably not one of them since declarer would have preferred
the finesse over the endplay. West's only alternative was to dump
the King of Clubs under the Ace and hope that his partner had the
Queen and Jack. When South led the second round of Clubs he was

down.

South could have made the contract if he had played the club
Ace early. At the fourth trick, even the best defender would be re<
luctant to part with the club King to prevent a possible endplay.
Furthermore, at the fourth trick West could not have counted down

South’s distribution.

 

Bob Asbille, fourth; Spencer
Clark, sixth; John Siekert, eighth
George Potter, tenth; and Bruce
Lueke, eleventh.

Tomorrow the Pioneers take
on Monmouth at 1:50 and will
attempt to move their confer-
ence record past the .50ﬂ mark.
