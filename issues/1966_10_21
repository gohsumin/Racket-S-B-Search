Students Aid Tornado Victims

By KRYS NEUMAN

Fiftyrtwo Grinnell students responded
to a plea lor aid from tlle tornado-
struck Northwest lowa town, Belmond,
last Monday.

Chaplain Dennis Haas, who made the
original request lor volunteers in chapel
Sunday, said, “i am pleased with the re-
sponse considering the short notice.
Many students are concerned about
what goes on beyond these walls. No
matter what the need i felt Grinneil
students would respond.”

The tornado hit Friday afternoon, in-
iliciing 57,5ou,ooo worth or damage in
three minutes. A subsequent communi-
cations breakdown hampered immediate

Belmond, there were college students, in-

Higher Wages? Senate Offers Support

Walkout Planned;

Strike Tomorrow?

By ALAN AXELROD

At the end of a two-hour
Wednesday night session, the
Senate approved a resolution to
let SAGA workers know that
the Senate is sympathetic to
their requests for higher Wages.

The resolution came in re-
sponse to a report submitted by
Craig Allin, Chairman of the
Senate Food Service and Wage
Scale Committee, in which he
told oi plans by workers at the
Quadrangle dining hall to go on
strike starting Saturday at 12
noon.

Allin had been planning to
submit proposals to Dean Rich-
ard Winters and Donald Lam-
bie, vice-president ot the col-
lege, when he was scooped by
a letter that Lamhie sent to all

THESE CAPTURED North Vietnamese women were in South Viet Nam to help the Viet
Cong win people over to their side. These young women and others like them are re.
terred to as "entertainers" in Viet Nam. They are pictured here ina ooyernrnentprison

SAGA workers announcing that
wages would be increased from
as to 95 cents per hour. Allin,
however, felt that this oifer was
merely "tokenism," and ap-
proached Lamhie with a gradu<

BU LLETI N

College Vice President
Donald Lambie yesterday
announced a further increase
in Saga wages.

According to the new pay
schedule, retroactive to 0c-
(ﬁber 15, Saga workers will
be paid at these graduated
rules:

Students in lst year or
work for Saga: $1.01) per hour

Students in 2nd year: $1.05
per hour

Students in 3rd or 4th year:
31.10 per hour

Lamhie emphasized that
the rates were temporary.
He said there is a probabil-
ity ot a board charge in-
crease for the 2nd semester
to cover the added cost.

ated wage plan in which SAGA
workers would initially receive
$1 per hour, with five-cent
raises coming at the end of the
firSt. third, ﬁlth, and seventh
semesters of service to SAGA.

Allin was told that such a
plan would necessitate raising
the annual board tee, and that
it would have to be ap-
proved by the trustees. Allin
reported to the Senate that the
plan would constitute an addi-
tional expense of $8.25 per stu-
dent per year.

in response to Senator David
Swee's remarks about the strike
negatively allecting ute col-
lege's attitude toward the pro
posed increases, Aws Board
President K a r e n Lauterbach
said she felt sure that the strike
would be looked upon as a re
sponsible protest against the
present SAGA wage scale.

The resolution states that the
Senate, feeling that SAGA
wages are unrealistic, approve!
of Such measures as are neces-
sary to alleviate the present
situation.

Prior to passing the SAGA
resolution, the Senate approved
resolutions concerning the re-
sponsibility of SGA in reime
bursing halls for stolen or dam-
aged property and the practice
or reserving study desks in the
library by keeping books there
ovemight.

Steve Kent lead a statement
by the Executive Cabinet that
came in answer to a request by
East Norris Hall that the Sen-
ate appropriate $50 from Gen-
eral Budget and Reserve to
partially pay for the replace-
ment or an amplifier and speak-
ers, part of a hall~owned stereo
system, that were stolen over
inaugural weekend last year.

The Executive Cabinet cun-

' tended that SGA cannot assume

responsibility tor reimbursing
individuals or groups for loss of
or damage to privately owned
property. The statement went
on to say that all residence
halls Should be made aware or
the necessity oi insuring such-
hallrowned appliances as ste-
reos. televisions, and refrigera-
(01's.

in regard to the library situ-
ation, the Senate passed a reso-
lution introduced by Senator
Chuck Wall. The resolution ex-
presses to the library the tie
sire oi the Senate “to have all
books removed from all desks
at the end or each day and
placed along the empty shelves
located either in the book cases
or along the walls, This is to
allow every student and not just
a tow to have access to library
desks.”

Sugar Coated Education?

While watching the 3&6 men busily cleaning the
Forum windows (seems like the last time they did that
was just before Commencement, but I wouldn’t swear to
it) some thoughts occurred to me about the nature of

the present weekend.

Basically, it seems to me that the whole thing is a
pretty good idea. Bringing all the parents and alums over
and giving them a taste of what Grinnell life really is
does seem to be a laudable undertaking.

The questions that bother me, however, are, do we
really give them much of an idea of what’s going on here
or do we just show them a big party and send them home
even more ignorant than before?

I suppose the whole thing harks back to the old
problem of the college’s image. Should we try to sugar-
coat the Grinnell education and hope the parents and
alums never see beyond the coating or should we
make an honest effort to show them what’s really hap-

pening here.

The sugarcoat approach would be fine except that
every once in a while the real thing does show through!
like when the 58;]! prints obnoxious articles or the stu-
dents return home for vacations.

Often when the real thing does show through, it of-
fers only an incomplete picture which out of context is
very damaging to our precious image. What is lacking is
a context of understanding. Homecoming could contribute

to such a context.

The point is, I suppose, that most of us at Grinnell
spend very little time going to football games, wearing
mums, electing queens and building floats. Yet for the
parent or alum who spends one day a year here it looks
like that really is about all that happens.

I’m not saying that homecoming football games
should be abolished, though perhaps a series of IM games
might be more representative, but that the emphasis

should be placed elsewhere.

Rather than send out an expensive invitation emblaz-
oned with a Grinnell halfback scampering for long yardage
(or maybe just trying to get back to the scrimmage line),
why not substitute a shot of a classroom discussion or
a play. If football games were once the motif of Grinnell
life, they are now only a pleasant, if slightly irrelevant,

adjunct.

What this weekend needs is more emphasis on such
things as tomorrow morning’s symposium or the Ameri-
can premier of the Russian drama. An expansion of ac-
tivities which show what Grinnell life really is and a
lightening of the emphasis on the football game would
in the long run, make homecoming a truly significant
event and not just the occasion for a haircut.

— Guy lombardo in '67

Certain more conservative
elements on campus have ex-
hibited a notable lack of en-
thusiasm for (and even fear
of) the radical departure from
the pasf represented in rnis
year’s homecoming. The
dance (And Jefferson Air-
plane; Visual: Anthony Mar-
tin) surely must be aversive
for these individuals, and it
is thus with their psychologi-
cal welfare in mind that 1 pre-
sent a schedule of homecom-
ing events for 1951 —— a sched-
ule so well adapted to Grin-
nell as to be immediately ac-
oepted. Sn even if all of you
forthright, conservative, and
sterile individuals are too in-
hibited to enthusiastically al-
lend the Jefferson Airplane
dance, you can still look for-
ward to next year:

Events of 1967 “Parents'
Weekend” (“homecoming,” of
course, will be eliminated ns
semantically inappropriate) will
begin on Friday. October 22,
with administration-alumni sym-
posium of primary interest to
all alums — “The Role of the
Maid in the Hall System.”

Friday, too, offers a host of
o t h e r Wonderful activities.
Two showings 0f “Bambi,” a
wonderful family movie for

the entire, wonderful family,
will ge biven in ARI-i — a
parents’ showing at 6:30 pm.
and a matinee at Z in the nth
emoon. Later a fascinating
exhibit of Alumni Needlework
of the Class of ’46 will be
shown in the Schneffcr Gal-
lery.

A treat for our scholars will
be a lecturesdemonstralion in
R o b e r t s concerning “Social
Amenities and Gracious Living”
by governor Harold E.
Hughes. Mrl Hughes will also
distribute free scarlet and
black penibox favors to quali-
fied seniors.

On Saturday, though, dis
real fun begins. Feeling the
necessity for victory, the ml:-
letic department has nego-
liated to play Pnrsons’ fresh-
man team. Prior lo the game,
there will be a musicale of
Beloved, Sacred Music by
Cowles.

Float competition will be de-
leted from the schedule; Clark
men would have won anyway
With their original theme —
“Scenes from the Life of Dean
Thompson."

Following the big game, re-
freshments will be served. Par-
ents and faculty will imbibe
Sherry and biscuits (Courtesy

of Golden Rule Funeral Homes)
in the North Lounge, While stu-
dents and chaperones will have
Kalli-Aide and graham crack-
ers (courtesy of the Rex) in the
South Lounge.

And the dance — oh, yes
. . . We are extremely form.
uate ln having secured Guy
Lombardo and his Royal Can-
adiansr Bubbles will be blown
onto the dance ﬂoor over
huge blocks of dry-ice. Let’s
hear it for Guy and the boys
who have ended a twenty-five
year booking at New York’s
Roosevelt Hotel just to come
all the way In central Iowa to
play your favorite tunes ..
notably the “Anniversary
Waltz."

Dress will be suicily en.
forced. Man must wear three-
butforl, v e s t ed, conservative
suits; skirt length must be
“modest." All dates must have
gaudy purple orchids at least
seven (7) inches in diameter.

This appears in me [0 be
the kind of thing that some

of you want, and personally I
think it’s just wonderful, won-

derful, wonderful. And, be-

sides, the Jefferson Airplane

(lance this weekend is a once-
ino-lifeiinie thin g anyway;

you‘ll never have to worry

about if oagin.

Questions Formality
To the Editor:

On attending chapel this year,
1 was happy to see that Mr.

Haas was not afraid to create a
religious atmosphere in his ser-

vice, especially when contrasted
with the tone of many of last
year’s chapel services. However,
it is my own feeling, and that
of most others to whom I have
talked, that this has been ac-
complished partially at the cost
of informality and meaningfur
ness. I think that most students
who amended the recent commu-
nion service appreciated the fact
that they could participate in a
Communion service for the cola
lege community, although many
regretted that it had to be ac-
companied by so much formali-
ty and ritual. When preoccu-
pation with formality displaces
the meaningfulness of the ser-
vice, then the formality is be-
ing carried too far. in the fu—
ture perhaps Mr. Haas and all
others concerned could con-
centrate more fully on bringing
a significant Christian message
to the sunday service. rather
than insisting on a potentially
perfunctory ormalify.

Classic Cynicism
To the Editor:

Never before have l been so
thoroughly disgusted by a letter
appearing in the sell. I am, of
course. referring to John Cros-
sett‘s example of “classic” cyni-
cism. Anyone who can read the
special 5&3 and come away with
no more than a mental residue
of grammatical errors and in—
correct logic, should be copy-
ing manuscripts in a monastery
and not writing letters in con-
demnation of the fresh spirit of
involvement. which has been so
sorely needed at Grinnell. For
the first time in at least three
years the campus is really alive
with the, excitemenh of ‘new

ideas, and all John ci-osselt can
see is poor logic.

ironically John Crossett’s let-
ter_is itself a model of poor
logic and invalid goneralizsuon.
The statement that flows “mar
each argumentior rather each
utterance” is a classic example
To write such a letter last year
would have been equivalent to
kicking a mun who was already
down. but this year, in an at-
mosphere of innovation and ex-
citement. John Crossett has
only succeeded in making clear
how truly out of touch he is.

in Defense
To the Editor:

It is unfortunate that the
North and James Fetzer sing
presentation has been misin-
terpreted and distorted by Peg«
gy Barlett in her letter in last
week's paper.

Miss Barlett referred to a pre«
sentzltlon that dealt with, as she
phrased it, “the topic of Negro
culture.” if Miss Barleht had
listened more closely to the nar-
ration, she might have recalled
more precisely that it made
specific reference to “the Negro
farm hand in the 1850’s" Now
the kind of music created by
and about these people was the
essence of the NorthsJames Fet-
zer presentation, the mood of
which was clearly not dems
gatory. The recurrent themes
that ran through all of the
songs were “I got a crown up
in a the kingdom, Ain'a that
good news,” “There is a balm
in Gilead to make the wounded
whole," and “I got plenty o’
nothin’, and nothin’s plenty for
me ('cause) 1 got my girl, got
my Lord, got my song.” It is ex-
tremely disrespectful to twist
the meaning of Gershwin's
music and Heyward’s lyrics, as
Miss Barlett did to make her
Eolnt. If Miss Barlett had any

nowledge of the musical Porgy
and Bess, she could not have
inaccurately concluded that the
message was simply ”nothin’s
plenty for me.” And more im-
portant, as in all great choral
music, the song smks for it-
self, if you listen to the whole
song.

And n point about dialect.
Mr. Burleigh, one of the famous
Negro folk song writers of the
1880’s, and his contemporaries
wrote all their songs in dialect.
Heyward wrote his lyrics in the
same style. To reconstruct the
lyrics in “perfect” English, to
tamper at all with u composer’s
work, is an insult to the com<
poser and a misrepresentation
of what he wrote. This was not
our lniEntIOn.

Finally, our costumes were
part of a context —— a period in
time, a place in history. When
Miss Barlelt changed die Lime
and place, she protected no in-
nocence. What made her sick
(“Your handling of the topic
was offensive . . l and you don’t)
even know it") cast an ironic
reflection, the proportions of
which exceed even her poor

taster

To the Editor:

Having read and reread Peg-
gy Barleth lemr fo rho sou
last week regarding Fetzer, 1
am still completely unable to
understand it.

Although I on: not a Negro
Culture major, there are certain
facts upon which even I feel
qualified to comment. The form
er slave condiu'on of the Ameri-
can Negro is no secret, nor is
it, 1 believe, a negative reflec<
tion on the Negro In any sense
of the word. It is, lo borrow on
expression, a sickening chapter
in American history, but it is a
chapter of which the Negro is
the victim, not the culprit. The
only people who should have
been sensitive about Oul' pre-
sentation are white.

It is in mis sense that North
and James attempted to treat
the Negro Slave culture in Fet-
zer; not as u mockery of his
position, but as a tribute to the
dignity with which he bore his
unjust burden.

Although undoubtedly not an
moi replication of the Negro
condition of the 1850’s, our pre-
sentation was, we feel, treated
with dis highest degree of re~
specl, dignity, and sensitivity,

Are You a Conscientious Objeotor?
Supreme Court Clarifies SS Definition

By RICHARD SCHNEIROV

Young men, seeking drsir eic
emotion more often today. may
choose a position of conscien-
tious objection to war only to
have it declared legauy unac-
oepraoie.

The conscientious objection
classification was established by
Congress, and can at any time
Ire revoked. According to sec-
tion 6i or the Universal Milirary
Training and Service Act oi 1951
a “C0” is an individual who
“by reason or religious training
and beliei, is conscientiously op.
posed ro participation in war in
any lorm. Religious training
and belief in this connection
means an individual's belief in
a relation to a Supreme Being
involving duties superior to
those arising from any human
relation, our does not include
essentially political, sociological
or philisophical views or merely
a personal moral code."

For the Individual who is I
member of a theistic, organ-
ized religion there is usually
little trouble in obtaining
“C0” sums. He hll merely
to atilrm his belief in I Su-
preme Being and then prove
by witnesses or reiererwe that
ha is sincere in his objection
to war. However, the individ.
ull who does not believe in
God or has dimbts will run
into some dﬂﬂculty.

Until recently agnostic or
atheism: “C05" were denied
d e s i r e d classification. and
many times went to prison. But
on March 8, 1965, a landmark
Supreme Court decision was
handed down in the case oi the
United States vs. Daniel Seeger.
Seeger stated that his “skep-
ticism or disbelief in the exist»
Brice oi God “did” not neces-
sarily mean lack oi faith in
anything whatsoever"; and that
his was a "belief in and devo~
tion to goodness and virtue for
their own sakes and a religious
faith in a purely ethical creed."
Seeger's local Selective Serv-
ice Board denied his applica«
troii for “CO" status because
his objection to war was not
based upon a heliei in a rela-
tion to a Supreme Being. In its
decision to allow Seeger's
claim. the Court stated its new
interpretation oi the Selective
Service Act: The test of belief
in a relation to a Supreme Be-
ing is whether a given oelier
that is sincere and meaningiui
occupies a place in the like or
its possessor parallel to that
filled by the orthodox belief in
God or one who clearly quali-

ties for the exemption. Where
such belieis have parallel po-
sitions in the lives of their re-
spective holders we cannot say
that one is in ‘a relation to a
Supreme Being’ and the other
is not. . . . Local boards and
Courts in this sense are not
free to reject beliefs because
they consider them ‘incomprev
hensible.’ Their task is to (i!-
clde whether the helieis pro-
ressed by a registrant are sin-
cerely held and whether they
are, in his own scheme or
things, religious.”

An aspect or the law which is
ambiguous is the phrase “train-
ing and belief.” The two terms
training and oeliei were meant
to be viewed as a single con-
cept. A iederal court held that
“so tar as Congress was think-
ing. it regarded it as meaning
no more than individual expe
rience supporting beliei; a
mere background against which
sincerity could he tested,” The
word religious does not neces
sarily reier to orthodox views.
The individual “CO" does not
have to belong to a church or
attend Sunday School.

The clause “war in any
form” is also very important.
The ‘co'i must not only ob.
ject to the particular war. but
object Io ALL WIr including
war against I state such as
Nazi Germany. This clause
prevents peopll whose view:
are "political, sociological. or
philosophical” irorn becoming
elem."

There is still another impor-
tant decision to be made by the
“C0." He can ask [or noncom-
batant duty in the army, in
which case he will probably end
up as a medic. The noncom<
batant is classified MO. The
"C0” can also object to all
iorms or military service. in
this case he will be classified IO
and assigned to civilian work
in the national interest —- most
likely as a worker in one or the
many government - sponsored
programs. it is also possible
that at "ca" will object to being
connected in any way with the
military establishment. If he
reiuses to even accept civilian
Work, the “C0" is in serious
difficulty with the law. Most (if
these extreme objectors end up
in jail — the penalty being a
term up to ﬁve years and/or
a fine or not more than ten
thousand dollars.

What are the procedures one

must go through to become
classified as a “CO”? The first
opportunity the registrant gets
is when he ﬁlls out 555 Form
No. 100. This is mailed to each
individual after he register!
with his local board. The pro!-
pective “CO" then signs a state-
ment on the form stating that
he is opposed to participation in
war in any iorm and requesting

Arnow Relates Third Year Abroad Experiences

Paris Center of Political Activity;
Anti-Americanism Considered

By MIKE ARNOW

Rather than relate all the ex-

eriences of a year in France.

would like to write about two
mbjects pertaining to this year
which are probably of particu-
lar interest to Grinnellians:
political lite in Paris, and so«
(Jailed French “Anti-Ameri-
oanism”.

Political Activity

Paris. and especially the
student quarter. is n gnldmine
.8 political activity. one of
my ﬁrst eirperlences in stu-
dent political lite was an
evening session sponsored by
the Young Communist Party,
where several North Vietna-
mess “darts showed films
on recent economic develop-
ments in North viet Nam,
and then led n discussion, in-
discriminately calling every-
one “comrade." Several
weels later, French students
marching and chanting to
protest the war in Viet Nam
(“H.S. go horn ' eta).
played a fascinating game at
cat-nud-monse with the police,
through two miles or rush
hour trufﬂe.

But political activity in Par-
is, is not restricted to one point
or view. Fights between the
young communist students and
members of "l’Dccident" (a
right-wing student group dedi~
Gated to the defense of “West-
ern Civilization and Christian-
ity”) are known to occur. Once
I attended a dinnerdiscussinn
on Viet Nam, and was some-
what surprised to ﬁnd that the
chief speaker and all the Viet-
namese present were staunch
advocates or us. military in-
tervention in Viet Nam.

Nor is political activity in Far-
is restricted by age. Last win«
car, there was a meeting of the
French Leit (a rather loose
term which included —— at that
meeting — supporters oi the
French socialist and communist
parties) to protest the kidnap-
ping oi Mehdi Ben Berka,
Moroccan revolutionary who
had been abducted from the
middle of Paris, in broad day-
light, last November. l-ligh ot<
ficiais in the De Gaulie govern-
ment had been implicated in
the “affair", and the chief
speaker of the evening, M.
Francois Mitterand (who had

opposed De Gaulle in the
December election). used
the occasion to deliver a diaa
tribe against the government.

The most interesting as-
speet or this meeting win
that it incimhd a relatively
small proportion or students.
and a large number at
adults, especially those in the
the middle - age category.
These were the people who
identiﬁed tlielnsdlves win:
the traditional French Leitr
the heirs or Jaures: the leg-
acy or L‘eon him and the
popular treat or the 1930's.

Encounter

In addition to meetings of a
strictly partisan nature, there
are a host of meetings or a
more general character; “The
Famine in indi " with
U N r: s c 0 speaker or,
discussions on economic devel-
opment with people in aid
programs in the French
government. But perhaps the
most stimulating political en-
counter I had was a discussion
with an Algerian sociology stu-
dent during a GOO-mile car
He had been active in various
youth projects in Algeria, had
left when Ben Bella was OVSF
thrown, and was so critical of
the Boumedienne regime that
his presence in Algeria would
been considered subversive. He

was very articulate. and his
experiences in youth work in
Algeria were enlightening as to
the social progress being made
in a developing country.

in the past few years, we
have heard a great deal about
French ”anti - Americanism".
Ever - conscious of our world
image, we take this perhaps too
seriously. Certainly, there is
some animosity toward Amelia
Cans, but it should be under-
stood and not exaggerated.
When such animosity does in
tact exist. it is not always sini-
ple to identify the cause. Some-
times an unpleasant personal
experience with an Amercan
may lead to animosity. At oth<
ei- times, it may develop as the
result of rumors or stories about
Americans. Sometimes un-
triendly feelings toward Ameri-
cans may just be part or a rival-
ry which the French have ielt
historically with the AngloSax-
ons.

Chauvinism?

But very onen, therg is an
element or national pride in-
volved. it is not surprising
that the French, who, a cen-
tury and a hall ago regarded
their country as the polltical
and cultural capital or the
world, should be envious of,
or uniriemlly toward, the
giant or the western hemis-
pherc. In fact, the chauvin-
ism which one sometimes
sees in the French attitude
toward their own culture and
civilization may, to a large
degree, he more consolatory
than real. its n French pro<
ressor or political science put
it humorously, “You Ameri-
cans are politically and eco-
nomically our s u p e r l n r.
Therefore, culturally, we are
your superior” (or, “we must
think that we are, to maintain
self-esteem").

But “anti - Americanism" is
not so rampant as many would
believe. In fact, a few distinc:
tions might help to clarify this
notion. First oi all, many
people tend to equate "anti -
Americanism" with the French
desire tor an independent
ioreign policy. Certainly, dir-
ierences or opinion in politics,
ii extreme enough, can lead to
animosity, and Vice verso.

about the present world point
Cal situation, That De Gaulle
and some Frenchmen see
themselves as the builders iii
a new Europe is not so symptir
matic of their wish to elevate
France to a position of strength
and prestige in the world
arena.

Second, a distinction should
be made between what the
French {eel (or what De
Gaulle feels, which may not
always be the same thing)
in the realm of international
politics, and how Frenchmen
feel personally toward Ameri-
cans. 1 spoke with a number
of French people who.
regardless or their political
ideas, were quite open-mind-
ed in their personal relatio-
with Americans.

A third distinction which must.
he made is that between “ante
Americanlsm” and the nature or
the French people. The French
are, in general, quite reserved
and still toward strangers, not
only foreigners, but other
Frenchmen as well. in fact,
Frenchmen would be the last:
people in the world to deny
their sometimes chilly nature.

American Sensitivity

We Americans are very sert‘
sitive to such reserve for we
strike up tricndships easily;
sometimes tend to think of the
rest at the world as either for
or against us; and think this
dichotomy Will manilest itself
even in personal relationships.
Thus, the attitude of a French
man who is frankly indifferent
toward us personally can be
disconcerting.

Several other clarifica-
tions should he made, For
example, one source or the

but tickets must be obtained at
the Alumni Offices in advance,
due to the limited size of the
Arena Theater.

Although written in the typi-
cal realistic mode of the con-
temporary Russian th e ate r.
which necessarily retlects cer-
tain Socialistic tenets, “In
Search oi Happiness" contains
“a certain universal depth and
humanness to the characters,”
according to director Heligott.
Except for references to the
Communist Youth Organization,
which could make an easy tran-
sition to a Western counterpart
like the Boy Scouts, the play in
tact has very little to contine
it to its locality, and still less

Considering that the play in—
troduces a cast of 14 in its hour
and a half span, the charac-
ters are remarkably clear and
interesting. Heligm has angli-
cizetl some of the names to cut
down on the contusion in iden-
tilying so many characters in
so short a time.

As a prelude to the play, a
panel discussion on the Russian
theater took place Tuesday alt-
ernoon in South Lounge. Some
concern was expressed then

about audience reaction to the @

alien vocabulary that crops up
occasionally in the script. Since
the play is not blatant political
propaganda but a serious
drama at human values, it is
important that the audience not
be put oit by such phrases as
“When communism is estab-
lished . ” Richard D. Meyer,
director of the Grinnell Thea-
ter, reiterated his confidence in
the Sophistication of the Grin—
nell audience.

The play centers around a
family in Moscow, consisting of
three sons and a daughteri The
eldest son, Theodore (Frederick
Schwaller) and his Wife Helen
(Deborah Abbott) are living
temporarily with the iamily un-
til they find Iheit‘ own “Hat."

and the adolescent son Victor
(Dick Hertz), who writes poetry
and loves fish. At the end of
the second act Helen and Theo-
dore move away [rpm the fam-
ily Theodore. once a promis—
lng young scientist, has been
corrupted by his Wife's domi-
nance and materialism. The
play is not very good literature
or theater and tends heavily to—
ward the sentimental. How

ever, it is interesting as an ex- ‘

ample of modern Russian
drama, and Heligott’s presenta»
tion looked Very promising in
rehearsal.

German Professor Discusses Europe's Future

Last Thursday evening in R0-
berts, Dr. Kartkristoph Schweit-
zer o! Berlin’s Free University
spoke on “Germany, DeGaulle,
and Europa" He viewed West
Germany as a country promot-
ing wider European integration
and De Gaulle as a 19th century
throwback blocking such efforts.
He also altered his own thesis
for understanding German his-
tory of the last seventy years.
These years, he said, have
seen constant neurotic shiits in
German thought from a view
of national superiority to one
or national inferiority. Alter
1948, he said, Germany was set-
tling down to a medium position,
but De Gaulle’s nationalism has
stimulated an incipient German
nationalism.

Dr. Schweitzer said that Ger-
man policy makers, unlike many
foreign policy makers today.
have three general goals. First,
Germany wants to work for an
integrated Europe, a European
community. He cited Article 2A
of the Federal Republic’s consti-
tution which authorizes the gov-
ernment to surrender national
sovereignty to a greater Euro-
pean community. This goal has
been supported by the "greater
majority" or Germans. Second,
West Germany wants reuniﬁca-
[ion of Germany. Third, West
Germany wants peace and has
renounced war as a means of
diplomacy. Despite internation-
al cliches about peace, Dr.
Schweitzer said. “This goal is
taken very seriously in Ger-
many and in Europe.” All par-
ties in W. Germany support
these goals and believe none
should be carried out at the
expense of the other.

De Gaulle Out of Tune

“De Gaulle," Schweitzer said,
is "out of tune with the majority
of his countrymen, Presiding
over a titular democracy, he has
restored order to French politics
~and for this We should be
gratciui — hot the question is
who next. in foreign policy gen-
erally he is intellectually over-
rated. There are more inconsis-

PurseII Publishes

A paper which Lyle E. Pur-
sell, mathematics, presented be-
iore the Iowa Academy of Sci-
ence at Peila on April 15. has
been accepted for publication
in Mathematics Magazine. it is
entitled “Unitorm Approxima-
tion of Real Continuous Func-
tions on the Real Line of In-
ﬁnitely Dillerentiable F u n c-
tions.”

tencies here than many see. He
Is influenced by the love of the
spectacular." Schweitzer cited
French policy in SE Asia as one
example of inconsistency. There
the French represent a colonial
power yet are liberally mani-
pulating antircolonial feeling.

Schweitzer believes De Gaulle
has Slowed the impetus for
European integration but can.
not stop it. De Gaulle’s goal of
a Europe tor itselr has negative
effects on Nato and to Schweit-
zer is inconsistent. De Gaulle
will not give up Nato but gives
up an integration in the alli-
ance which is its basis. “In his
heart," Schweitzer quipped, “De
Gaulle must know he's wrong.
His is a prestige policy that is
nonsense realistically.“

In the long mm, it is disaster-
ous. We should work to keep up
a triangular relationship be-
tween Washington, Paris, and
Bonn and look forward to a post
De Gaulle era. The concept of
an Atlantic partnership is still
a healthy one."

Discontent Over viet Nam

in iurther conversations with
the 58:13, Schweitzer said there
was “great discontent" in Ger
many about the viet Nam War.
It is viewed as a “tragedy." an
unnecessary aiiair which the
majority or Germans accept but
do not support with any enthusi-
asm and do not want to see
escalated, There is a small mi-
nority in the German universi-
ties that believes the US.
should get out. Ultimately, he

said, we should seek a solution

With regard to German poli-

that Erhard is out by ‘69." Ger-
many is facing an economic

question for the latter, he said,

liament has what he called a

out another one to replace him.

perimenting with new players
in the backfield, trying to get
more heft into the running
game.

The Beloit Buccaneers will
come to Ward Field also in the
midst or a slump. Aiter beating
Knox 426 and Coe 36-14, the
Bucs have lost their last two
ball games 2149 In Carleton
and last week 36-0 to St. Olaf.

Beloit has one of the most
explosive olienses in the league.
Relying mainly on a poweriul
air attack, they can score any-
time. A majority of the offense
is due to the passing combina-
tion of Rick Stutz and George
Lindenberg. Lindenberg is con-
sidered to be one of the best
ends in the league and Stutz
was instrumental in the defeat
the Bucs gave the Pioneers last
year at Beloit.

The running attack though is
below average and must teams
that have been able to contain
the passing attack have been
able to stop Beloit. This is what
happened at St. Olaf last week
when Beloit was able to com-
plete only 14 of 39 passes.

This week Coach Bowers has
to build up the size of his back-
iicld, Against Monmouth the
Pioneers were not able to score
a Couple of times when they
got close to the goal because
they were too small to move
out the Scots.

Monmouth was able to score
a fluke touchdown when 2 Mon-
mouth player temporarily tum.
bled a punt but picked it up
and caught all the Pioneer de.
tenders running the wrong di-
rection and went all the way
{or a score. Their other touch-
down came after they had
blocked a Pioneer punt on the

15 yard line. The Pioneers also
scored twice, once on a pass to
Mike Schwartz, but were bi:-
hind in the fourth quarter 34-13
after missing a 2»point conver—
sion. Twice the Pioneers drove
deep into Monmouth territory
but were stalled and had to try
field goals. The first one was
wide and the second was short.

Coach Bowers has decided [u
shift hardrrunnillg Rich Weeks
from quarterback to halfback.
Weeks picked up 110 yards run-
ning last week and is expected
to be just as tough at halfback.
Moving in to the quarterback
slot will be either Tom Lower
Dr Kent Thomson. Rounding out
the backﬁeld will be Don Krait—
sik at the other halfback and
Jon Buswell at fullback. With
this backfield Bowers expects
to be able to grind out more
yardage on the ground, espe-
cially up the middle where the
small Pioneer linemen have
been haying trouble moving out
their opponents.

Bowers is not planning to
make any great changes in the
line. At center Don Malum may
replace Bob Geller, Ken Aug-
ustine may be called on to play
some offense in addition to his
detensivs duties, and Mike
Schwartz may be given more
work at offensive end. Aside
from this the line will stay in-
tact.

The Pioneer defense has been
steadily improving and Bowers
is quite pleased with it. But
Beloit's defense is also tough
and, aside from last week, has
been very impressive.

Both Beloit’s offense and die
tense ore third in the league
while the Pioneer offense is
sixth and the defense fifth.

 

If we do something that dis-
pleases you, TELL its. WE are al-

ways glad to hear constructivo

criticism. Of course we may chase

you out with a butcher knife .
