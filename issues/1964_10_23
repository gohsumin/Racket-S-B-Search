Stauss Outlines Role of Student.
Parents in Liberal Education

By Cynthia Brust

In the annual Parent’s Week—
end lecture, presented last Sat-
urday in Herrick Chapel, James
H, Stauss, Dean of the College
and acting president, explained
what the college expects of stu<
dents, parents, and alumni.

Stauss began with a brief
summary of the goals of a lib-
eral arts college. it is. he said,
created for “teaching. learning
and scholarship in the sciences
and arts,” as well as for pro»
professional training. He de«
scribed the ideal graduate as
an “intelligent amateur” in the
wide range of liberal arts sub-
jects and an "intelligent “ap-
prentice” in his major field.

”We expect our students to
do work which merits the re—
spect of their professors,"
Stauss stated, He also declared
his desire to develop “hard—
boiled realism” in the Students
and their parents in two areas

A Mock Presidential Election

‘ for students and faculty will

be held next Tuesday, October

27, just one week prior to the

November 3rd national election
date.

Students will vote in the lunch
lines at Cowles and the Quad-
rangle between ll am. and 1
pm. Faculty members will vote
through the Faculty Exchange.
Paper ballots will be’used.

The Mock Election is co-
sponsored by the Student Gov-
ernment Association, the Young
Republicans and Young Deni-
ocrats, and the Program in
Practical Political Education.

Commenting on why voting
machines will not be employed
as they have been in past
events of this sort, PPPE Di-
rector C. Edwin Gilmour (Pol.
Sci.) said that the County Aud-
itor was unable to make the
machines available because
they- are presently being check-
ed and prepared for the elec-
tion, November 3rd.

Last spring, in a campusvwlde

ty tickets nominated by the Col-

tions, is LodgeHatfield slate

which often present great emo-
tional problems. The first of
these is the “arithmetic of col—
lege competition,” the Well-
lmown fact that only one~half
the students can be in the up-
per 50% of their class.”

The second related area is
the ”emotional trap caused by
the distance between actual
possibility and unrealistic ex-
pectation,” on the part of either
the student or his parents. This
problem, according to Etauss.
is often involved in the con-
flict between dependence and
independence which plays such
a major role in a college stu~
dents emotional life. We expect
the students to look toward
their maturity,” he said. “We
want them to be hard-boiled,
realists ~ to declare their in-
dependence of unrealistic ex-
pectations and relax.” Stauss
emphasized that he was not ad—
vi'sing students to ignore the
expectations of their parents,
but rather to not create an emo-
tional issue of them.

The parents’ role in this de-
velopment was outlined in three
areas: to allow the students to
adjust to reasonable expecta-
tions—“We ask you to 'accept
the standard of the students’
own best efforts"; to allow him
to discover and affirm his own
interest; and to realize that he
owes it to himself to think for
himself.

Stauss pointed out that the
student must be left emotion-
ally free to meet the commit
merits of a liberal arts educa-
tion. These are the commit-
ments to a humane under-
standing of the world’s great
ideas and ideals, to informed
and responsible citizenship on
every level, and to sophisti-
cated entertainment for him-
self and others.

He touched briefly on the
need for improvement in the
dormitory systems on campus.
We need, he said, to develop a
student culture which will sup-
port the liberal arts concepts.
The students must develop ma—
turity and meet standards of
dignity and courtesy in their
relationships, In this area, he
pointed out that the adminis-
tration and faculty expect un-
derstanding of these aims from
the parents and alumni. He
asked in conclusion that all who
care for the college and its stu-
dents bear in mind that “rule-
making for students is not the

“Grinnell is one of about six
American cities, and the only
college city, in which filming is
being done for this tour of the
Philharmonic," said Don Jones
(music). “A documentary

and American educational tele—

Jones also noted that this

Dil'hyramb Uses French Theme:
'Discotheque' to Be Featured

,Grinnell borrows an idea from
the French for the first dithy-
ramb of the season to be held
following the Warsaw Philhar-
monic Orchestra concert to-
morrow night in Loose Lounge.
The t h e m e Discotheque
means “records" in French. It
refers to a type of nightclub
that is found all over Europe
and is now becoming popular in
the United States, The surround-
ings are not extremely elegant.
and it is the type of place that
would be frequented by high
society. Entertainment music
is from records rather than a
band. It is one of the newest
developments in the small din»
ner club atmosphere.
Committee chairman Martha
Montgomery said “We are try-
ing to ayoid the tea and sand-

wich idea and get something
more substantial in planning
the menu.” Dithyramb is serv-
ing different sorts of cheeses,
bread, dill pickles, and punch,

The idea behind dithyramb is
an attempt to provide a maxi-
mum of sophisticated enter-
tainment to a small number of
people'after a formal event. It
usually includes a formal menu,
and some type of music, pat~
terned after night club enter-
tainment. A small admissiOn fee
is charged to control the num~
ber of people attending. Social
money is budgeted for this, but
it does not cover all of the ex-
pense.

”I think this shows that the
cultural exchange program can
get things done better than sit<
ting on our fences yelling oaths
at each other," Jones res
marked.

The Warsaw Philharmonic is
in this country as part of an
exchange in which the Pitts-
burgh Symphony went to P0-
land. Jones said, “The Pitts-
burgh orchestra was received
very hospitably in Poland; we
would like to see an equally
kind and generous treatment
for the Warsaw orchestra while
it is here.”

The orchestra‘s regular 90
members, under the direction
of Stanislaw Wisiocki, will play
Berloiz’s Roman Carnival Over-
ture and Beethoven’s Eroica
Symphony at both Grinnell con<
certs. The matinee perform-
ance will also include piano
soloist Wladyslaw Kedra play-
ing Chopin's Piano cencerto in
F Minor, while the evening con-
cert will feature violinist
Wanda Wilkomirslia in the War
lin Concert by Karlowicz.

The Philharmonic arrived in
this country for its second
North American tour on Octo'
bar 2 and began its concert
series October 4 with a per-
formance at Constitution Hall
in Washington, D.C. They have
since played in New York,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan,
and Minnesota. The orchestra’s
only other Iowa performance

Resident Advisers

‘- A program for residential advisers in halls on

North Campus is in the discussion stages with college
officials. .

\ In a statement made this Wednesday, Dean of the
College James H. Stauss admitted, “I have an interest
in the wide consideration of the possibility of ball ad-
Yisers.”

Dean of Men S. Eugene Thompson also professed
an interest in such a program He stressed, however,
that the presence of David McBlain, an instructor in
mathmetics, in East and West Norris halls this year
Is not in any way meant to signal an imminent imple-
mentation of a resident adviser program.

“McBIain is an instructor in mathematics and noth-
ing else. His residence in the Norrises is due to the
availability of the suite left vacant when Mrs, June
Main became a housemother on South Campus,” said
Thompson

Although the program is only in the discussion
stages and although McBlain’s only official duty is to
teach mathematics, the vacant suite on Norris seems
to have provided college officials with an opportunity
to study student reactions to faculty advisers

Explaining the extent of administration considera-
tion of a resident program, Thompson said that he has
been talking with officials from colleges which have
such programs. “We know resident advisers work well
at other schools, The program is worth studying. There
is, however, nothing in the college’s budget for this
program, and there is no hiring going on. It has been
discussed with the CofHP and a couple halls.”

Thompson assured the campus that no resident ad-
viser program will be instituted without consulting stu«
dents.

As Thompson sees the advisers, “They would be
people with a standing in the academic community,”
They would include faculty, graduate students, and oth-
ers with academic positions.

According to Thompson‘s argument, r e s i Cl e n ts
would provide an adult source of information and would
not be used for policing.

Grinnell now is one of the few colleges in the coun-
try with no resident adviser program in conjunction
with a hall system, A resident program was given'up at
Grinncll in 1953, partly because residents were not easy
to find. Thompson noted that while there was apparent-
ly no student agitation for doing away with that pro
gram, there also was no great sense of loss.

Should Grinnell have to exhume a program dead
eleven years — a program that Thompson admits is
hard to staff? Is this program mainly an adult source
of information or an adult source of continued uncer-
tainty?

Dear Editor:

in this letter I wish toadeal
with Master A, Sad Freshman’s
latest failure. His “penetrating
observations on campus imma-

turity were definitely confirmed
by two letters in last week’s
S813” — especially his own. He
wished to offer examples of
immaturity — he certainly did.
One can easily dismiss his
"sad" letter. However, I will
condescend to enter an epistola-
mry debate with this pole-
micist. I feel a change in direc~
tion is needed from condemna-
tion of imaginary faults to pro-
posals for the common good.

In reCEnt weeks the role of
the Student Senate and SGA
has been questioned. They have
been criticized for serving no
purpose. Despite the usurpation
of its power by The Administra—
tion, student government can
remain as a functioning body —
a domestic peace corps, so to
speak;

Why should the school drait
troops for the “Forum Legion,"
and consequently incur addi-
tional expense? Responsible
student leaders could volunteer
to fill the ranks.

Student Senate politicos could
also serve in other ways. The

Homecoming floats have lit-
tered the campus. Trees are
dropping their leaves. A com-
mittee of civic-minded student
leaders could clean up the cam—
pus by picking up napkins,
preps victimized by upperclass~
men‘s “innocent humor,“ and
dead leaves, This “White
Knight” committee could also
patrol the halls Sunday mom-
ings to dispose of Saturday
night's refuse, thus saving the
hall exorbitant BELG assess—
ments. In time the White Knight
committee could extend its op-
erations into other aspects of
maintenance I feel the student
leaders are responsible enough
to perform these tasks.

At first glance these pr0<
posals may sound a bit unrelan
ed to SGA'S normal duties. Yet
the future of student govern~
ment is in doubt, its legislative
power has been removed. but
its service power remains. By
their actions student leaders
can set an example of “cone
sciousness of social responsibil-
ity" and “service to their fels
lowmen (College Bulletin)" .-
thus perpetuating their offices.

These are but a few proposals
for student service. Student
government is an hereditary in-
stitution, but its future rests on
shifty foundations. I call for let»
ters supporting my proposals.
(Those with other proposals
and arguments may a l s 0
write.) “I doubt not that they

will be forth coming." SGA—all
the way.

Baron Retounts Year In Moscow
Final Impression less Favorable

By Ann Showalter

After spending eight months
in Moscow last year as part of
a US-USSR cultural exchange
program, h i s t o r y professor
Samuel H. Baron reports that
most Americans who live in the
USSR for several months have
less favorable impressions when
they leave than when they lar-
rive.

in his informal address “An
American in Moscow,” last
Friday afternoon in Roberts
Theatre, Baron discussed the
favorable and unfavorable as-
pects of Soviet life from the
basis of his personal experi-
ences.

Baron noted the ever present
book reading, “You see people
reading everywhere— in sub-
ways, restaurants, and parks."
Often they are studying techni-
cal books, classical novels and
selected modern works.

"For people of poor means

the opportunity to get higher
education is probably better
than here," he stated. At the
University of Moscow he knew
many students only two or three
generations removed from serf-
dom. .
Baron noted that general con-
ditions have improved since
Stalin's death. “The people are
better dressed, there are no
forced labor camps, and west-
erners are much freer to trav-
el within the country. One is a
good deal safer walking in the
streets of Moscow after dark
than in New York or Chica-
go," he said.

In spite of these improve-
ments there remains a great
deal in Soviet life that is re-
pugnant to anyone from our
world," he asserted. The Soviet
“humanistic” philosophy of life
has created a system in which
“the man exists for the system
instead of the system for the
man." This results in the re~
striction of many personal free-
doms.

Baron found that this lack
of personal freedom permeates
Soviet life even to the extent
of everyday conversation. “I
might be talking to a person
who was being fairly open.
Then someone else would ap<
proach us and the open con-
versation would suddenly stop.
It is widely believed that in
every classroom, every office,
and each department in a fac-
tory, there is a professional
spy." he said.

Freedom of knowledge is
greatly curtailed by the com-
plete governmental control of
all communications No foreign
newspapers are available to the
public except for the Commu-
nist Party organs of other
countries Soviet citizens, in-
cluding students, must have

special permission in order to
check many categories of books
and magazines out of the li-
brary.

“The Iron Curtain is indis-
pensible to the continued exist—
ence of the regime,” Baron de-

SAMUEL BARON

clared. “The official picture
of the outside world is so far
from the truth it cannot stand
the light of day.” Soviet citi-
zens are free to travel to other
Communist countries and fre-
quently do so in groups. For
the average man, however,
traveling to a western country
is “about as likely as a trip to
the moon,”

According to Baron, the So-
viet system will change slowly
if at all. “If you ask an intelli—
gent citizen to explain why his
freedoms are restricted, he will

reply. ‘When you allow diverse

opinions, people get confused
and this leads to anarchy.’ They
can't seem to see \that there
may be alternatives inbetween
dictatorship and anarchyl" He
continued, “When you ask why
the mass of people don’t have a
voice in government, there is a
snobbery in the answer. They
say ‘The ordinary working man

Among young people he found

- cynicism toward the Commu<

nist ideals and a desire for per-
sonal advancement. He he-
lieves this cynicism may lead
to a “crisis of faith” in the
USSR.

At present there is relative
economic equality. A Skilled
laborer, doctor, teacher all
from $80 to $100 per
month Although housing, edu-
cation and medical care are
usually free, food and cloth«
ing are extremely expensive in
relation to wages. To make
ends meet it is the general
practice for wives to work. In
addition many people confided
to Baron, stealing is a wide-
spread and accepted practice,
Each steals “according to his
fashion." This means the fac-
tory worker may take home
the factory's product with him
while the newspaper writer
does freelance work on his
newspaper time.

Baron said the reluctance to
make sacrifices for the regime
and the desire for individual
gain may lead to a greater use
of the reward system, but he
was reluctant to draw definite
conclusions as to where the
USSR is headed.

Another aspect of the Le-
Moyne-Grinneil exchange pro-
gram can provide a rewarding,
challenging slimmer plus prac<
tice teaching credit for a few
selected Grindellians next sum-
mer. Success of last summer's
"Humanities Seminar” points to
a similar program for the sum-
mer of l965. Seniors Kristi Wil~
liams and Dodi Holcher were
last year’s participants.

The seminar at LeMoyne was
a part of a new program de-
veloped by graduate students at
iYaie University. Students from
.Yale taught similar seminars
throughout the South, designed
to aid in overcoming the ”Cul-
tural lag” in the education of
Southern Negroes. The eighty
Students at the LeMoyne sem-
inar were chosen from the Ne»

ro high schools in Memphis.
. hey ranged from those enter-
ing their sophomore year to
those who had just graduated,
but the majority were between
their junior and senior years.

Three students from Yale
taught courses in history,
speech, and philosophy, aided
by Miss HolCher and Miss Wil-
liamsl The two girls from Grin-
neil, and one from Yale, lived
in a college-owned house near
the campus, which is in'the
heart of the Negro district in
Memphis They were paid $200
plus room and board for the
iive- week seminar from money
given for the program by var-

ous foundations. They have al»
so received six Grinneil credits
tor practice teaching, after sub-
mitting reports on their work
by the Yale students they work-
ed under and also the LeMoyne
professor who set up the semi—
liar.

The courses were taught on a
college lreshman level. All stu-
‘dents took each of the classes,
and met together for a fourth
hour assembly period. This
hour was usually devoted to
lectures or tours relevant to the
courses. All of the LeMoyne
campus facilities were avail-
able to the seminar particia
pants, and most of them stayed
on campus the entire day. A
'drama workshop was held in

die afternoon for those who
were interested. Most of the
others used the library facilities
or swimming pool. -

The content of all the classes
was designed to develop skill in
communication of ideas and
the ability to deal with abstract

concepts. The history course
covered European history from
the French Revolution through
the causes of World War I. Em-
phasis, was placed on ideas
causes, and effects, rather than
names and dates. Plato was the
focal point of the philosophy
classes. The relevance of his
ideas to modern problems was
emphasized throughout. The
speech course concentrated
specifically on the development
of communication skills. Criti-
cal reading, and the writing and
delivering of speeches were the
main activities.

“The kids were remarkably
motivated, interested, intelli-
gent,” quick and receptive,"
Miss H o l c h e r commented.
"They were a joy to teach,”
Miss Williams added. Each stu-
dent filled out an evaluation of
the seminar at the end of the
session, and the idea that five
weeks had not been enough

 

The mechanical details of a
semester at LeMoyne are under
the guidance of Dale B. Terry
(Registrar). Arrangements are
quitedetinite now, and the plan
is ready to begin as soon as
Grinneil students show their in-
terest.

Students who spend a semes-
ter at LeMoyne will receive
transfer credits toward. their
Grinneli degree, These will ap~

\ ply much as summer school

credits do: the hours would be
added to the student’s record
but the grades earned will not
be added into his cumulative
average. The normal course
load, as planned by the com<
mittee which set up the ex-
change program, would be
three LeMoyne courses plus a
Grinneil independent project
This, of course, is a flexible ar~
rangement, and could be
changed to meet the needs of
the individual student He
would also be asked to submit
an evaluation of his experience
to the committee in charge
within a month of his return to
Grinneil, These evaluations will
be used to guide adjustments
of the academic mechanics of
the program and in the selec-

time appeared on almost all of

Both girls considered their
reception in the school and the

tion of students to go at later
dates.

Applications for a semester
at LeMoyne should be turned
in to Terry, although the actual
selection will be made by a faca
uity-administration committee.
Applicants would usually have
to be sophomores or juniors,
although seniors may be con-
sidered in unusual circuma
stances. The applicant’s grade
pomt‘ will not be weighed as
heavily as it is in most ex-
change programs, although he
should be well within the re-
quirements of a Grinneil de<
gree candidate. The actual se—
lection will be based much
more upon subjective factors
and the°student’s reasons for
applying. Applications should
include a statement of purpose
(what he expects to accomplish
and contribute), a proposed
list of courses to be taken, and
an outline of the area of re-
search for the independent pro-
ject. They should be in to Terry
by Nov. 1 for those who desire
to attend LeMoyne second se-
mester.

The financial arrangements or
the exchange provide that the
student will pay Grinneil tui-
tion costs and room and board
at the LeMoyne rates, These
will vary according to arrange-
ments, but should average
about $200 for the semester.
Barring any unusual circum-
stances, a student’s scholarship
and loan would be applied to
the tuition he would owe at
Grinneil. Accommodations will
be arranged individually, but
will probably be in one of two
college/owned homes near or
on the campus It is possible
that a student may be able to
live with a family in the neigh-
borhoodl Up to four Grinneil
students will be allowed to at-
tend LeMoyne in a given se-
mester.

LeMoyne College catalogues,
brochures, and further informa-
tion are available for the ask-
ing in Terry’s office, Burling 2.

LeMoyne, a primarily Negro college supported
by the American Missionary Association . . .

LeMoyne, a scholarly community devoted to
promoting a heritage of academic freedom . . .

LeMoyne, an opportunity, a challenge, a re-
sponsibility, an answer to the needs of its stu-
dents . . .

The uniqueness of LeMoyne College is bound up
in the complexities of its roles, its atmosphere, and its
faculty, administration, and student body.

Founded in 1870 as a normal school for teacher
education, LeMoyne now has the endorsement of the
Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. The road
to accredation has been filled with hard work and many
problems; smoothed only by some of the “Consecration,

Courage, and Truth” which is emblazoned on the school _
emblem. The journey has been dramatic, as has that .

of most colleges founded during the reconstruction. The
1870 founding was possible by a gift of $20,000 from Dr.
Julius LeMoyne, a Washington physician. The school
has been rebuilt, and its philosophy has changed sev-
eral times over the years, but its basic principles remain
the same. Through its years as a high school, teacher-
training school, and liberal arts college, its prime pur-
ose has been “. . . to train youth in effective Christian
iving, clear thinking and aesthetic appreciation."
The college has awarded over 2,000 bachelor de-
grees since its conversion to a four-year liberal arts
college in 1928. Despite this new emphasis on liberal
art, LeMoyne still supplies the public schools of Mem-
phis and Shelby County with a good percentage of their
eachers, just as it did when it was the only school in
the region which trained Negro teachers. The college
is also proud of the increasing number of its graduates
that enter graduate school for further study and pro-
fessional training in medicine, law, the ministry, gov-
ernment work, and college teaching.

LeMoyne is now thoroughly non-sectarian, and
makes no distinction in its admissions policy as to race,

religion, or nationality. It demands of its students a
Standard of excellence which fully equips them for
future careers or further study. Faculty members, 25%
of whom hold Ph.D.’s, concern themselves with their

students both as scholars and as individuals. LeMoyne
has retained itsﬁstanding as a commuter college, draw-
ing 95% of its student body of 550 from Memphis and
the surrounding areas. The college provides an exten-
sive program of cultural and social activities and
groups, both for its students and the Negro population
of Memphis. Under its president, Dr. Hollis F. Price,
LeMoyne college has assumed a role of leadership and
a position of excellence among Southern Negro col—
leges. It prides itself on its total commitment to its
students, the Memphis community, and the Negro race.

An exchange program was instituted last spring
between LeMoyne and Grinnell, after a visit to the
Memphis college by former president Howard R. Bow-

en. Under the terms of the program, up to four stu-
dents from each school will receive credit for a semes-
ter at the other institution. Ned Donahoe (Speech and
theatre) is now at LeMoyne under‘ thesfaculty ex—

change which goes along with the student program.

Soccer Team Overpowers Shimer

Good Teamwork

By Steve Casey

The Grinnell soccer team,

combining a sticky defense with
a persistent offense, overpow-
ered Shimer last Saturday 50.
The defense kept Shimer from
starting a sustained attack and
the offense, lacking the scoring
punch or absent Vincent Anku,
kept pestering Shimer’s de-
fense, forcing mistakes which
were converted into Grinnell
goals.
' Grinnell’s offense began ap-
plying pressure in the first
quarter with only brief inter<
ludes when Shimer had the ball.
Fred Miller scored the first
goal near the end of the quarter
climaxing a long attack on the
Shimer goal.

The second quarter found
Grinnell taking advantage of

two Shimer miscues. Ted Cole
took an errant pass from a
Shimer player and scored,
Later when the Shimer goalie
lost control of the ball after a
Grinnell shot, Felix Lungu took
it and scored to give Grinnell
a 3-0 half-time lead.

Frank Chilingulo scored the
only goal of the third quarter
on a penalty shot. Ted Cole

scored his second goal in the
fourth quarter when the Shimer
goalie lost control of the ball
again. allowing Cole to kick it
in the net.

Saturday‘s game was a real
team win for Grinnell. By add-
ing highvscoring Vincent Anku
to the lineup, Grinnell should

now be tough competition for

anybody during the rest of the
season.

Play Bucs

Fight To Stay In Race

The Pioneers and Beloit’s
Buccaneers, both r an k e d
among the Midwest Confer-
ence’s elite on defense, will be
battling to stay in the cham-
pionship race when they collide
on the Eeloit gridiron Saturdayi

It's Belolt‘s Homecoming,
with the game scheduled for 2
pm.
The two clubs currently share
third place with Coe, all having
3-1 marks and trailing co-lead—
ers Grinnell and Ripon by a
game. While the winner will
retain a shot at the title, the
loser almost certainly will be
relegated to the “spoiler" cate-
gory.

The spotlight will be on de~
fense as the Bucs and Pioneers
currently rank first and third,
respectively, in the loop in that
category. Beloit has allowed an
average of only 161 yards per
game with Grinnell being
touched for but 176 yards.

Both outfits have also been
extremely s tin g y pointwise,
Coach Edd Bowers‘ Pioneers
have allowed 25 markers and
have not had their goal line
crossed since the opening day
of the season. in their last three
outings, the Pioneers have
whitewashed Knox 160, Mon-
mouth 42-0, and Lawrence 21-0.
Opponents have managed 28
points against Beloit. Only
once, in a 15-13 loss to St. Olaf,
have the Bucs surrendered
more than one touchdoWn. Both
crews compliment their strong
defenses with potent offenses

Grinnell has an edge in this
department with 94 points and
an average of 292 yards per
contest. Though its point pro-
duction of 40 is less than half
of Grinnell's, Beloit has moved
the ball well all year and is
averaging 226 yards per en-
gagement.

Bowers sees Beloit as by far
the toughest team his Pioneers
have faced since dropping their
opener to Ripon, 25-l4.

Though his Grinnellians have
Collected 79 points in their last
three games, Bowers is still far
from satisfied with the offense.
Poor blocking, both in the inter-
ior line and backfield, has been
the Chief Villain. Because of an
inconsistent in s i d a running
game, the Pioneers have had
to rely on end sweeps more
than Bowers likes. He also 1a-
mented the inconsistency of the
passing game, but feels it is
now beginning to come around,

Because of Beloit‘s powerful
forward wall, the Pioneers al-
most certainly will stress going
around and over rather than
through. Passing will play a big
role in the outcome of the
game, the Grinnell

aerial game will keep the Bucs
honest.

sophomore Bob Watt will take

has netted 226 yards in 40 car»
ries and Watt has scooted for

unit will look like this: Dewitt
