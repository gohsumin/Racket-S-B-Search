Faculty Reiecls Clolfeller Proposal 4

by John Pepper
and Tim Porges

Acting as a committee of the
whole, the faculty narrowly
defeated the Clotfelter Propoe
sal to dropallcourse require-
ments for graduation on Oct.
5. The marginal and contested
4542 vote culminated four
weeks of lackluster debate,
parliamentary boondoggles,
and faculty apathy.
The “Clotfelter Proposal is
technically "Proposal III" of
the report submitted to the
faculty on August 25 by the
Faculty Summer Study Com-
mittee. Its full test is as fole
lows:
Proposal III: A curri-
culum with no fixed
requirements other than
a limitation upon the
number of credits that
may be counted towards
graduation in any one
field and a fixed
number of credits
for graduation.

To this was appended a sub-

Graham To Play
This Weekend

Violist John Graham will
make two appearances at Gre
itinell this weekend, the first
at 8 p.m. Friday with the Fri
ancesco Trio and the second
as a soloist at 8 p.m. Sunday,
both concerts to beperformed
in Herrick Chapel.

Graham lives in New York
City, where he is regularly
heard in recitals andin cham-
ber music concerts. He was
violist with the EEGUX’AI‘tS
String Quartet for five years
and toured the United States,
Canada, Europe and Australia
with the group.

A participant in the 1970
Marlboro Music Festival,
Graham will tour with an en-
semble from the festival this
winter. He plays a rare Amati
viola made in the same 17th
century period asMiss Hampe
ton’s Amati cello. Hehaspere
formed on many occasions
with members of the Fran'
cesco Trio.

Graham earned a degree in
music at the University of
California at Berkeley and
now lectures at the City Col-
lege of New York

stantial rationale written by
Mr. Clotfelter, which empha-
sized general educationas op-
posed to a fixed body of facts
to be known by all graduates,
a thorough revision ofthepren
sent advisory system, and its
replacement with one oriented
towards freshman guidance on
the basis of probable interest.
Noting that this system would
tie students rather more clo-
sely to their departments than
is the case now, Cletfelter
argues that Students would be
protected against "the despm
tic power of the departments
in three ways": credit limir
nation, recognition of inter-
disciplinary majors, anda re
quirement that all depart-
ments "devote some reason*
able part of their manpower
to general education courses,
designed for the nonvmajor."

In its Augnist 28 meeting the
faculty voted 72— It) in favor of
opening meetings discussing
general—education proposals
“to students and other meme
bers of the college commun-
ity," who would be allowed to
speak, but not to vote. How
ever, student attendance and
interest has been even scare
cer than that of the faculty,
and a maximum audience of
about 60 was by far the large
est student contingent. The
faculty further moved to con-
sider in subsequent meetings
"general education require
ments" rather than the pre-
viously stipulated "general
curriculum." This seems lat
ter to have been construed as
excluding from debate the iS*
sue of retaining Physical Ed-
ucation Requirements for
graduation. Defences were
then offered for alternative
proposals:

Mr. Parslow: spoke for the

maintenance of the current
general-education require-
ments as found in the Cata*
logue.

Mr. Erickson2arguedagainst
the Clotfelter Proposal as
presently a false alternative
to the current system. Rather,
he favored a distributionalre—
quirement which would allow
flexibility and increased chr
oice of individual courses,
while requiring ”some study
of several major areas."

Miss Noble: Spoke fora "tri-
partite distribution plan,"whe
ose main features would be a
"core course requirement"
consisting of a 4 credit H“,

manitles course concentrating
on individual student-teacher
contact (no more than 18 stu-
dents allowedper section),and
a distribution requirement of
8 credit hours in each ofthree
groups of departments:

Group A; Biology, chemis-
try, physics, psychology, lane
guage, mathematics.

Group B: Anthropology, ece
onomics, education, history,
political science, sociology.

Group C: Art, communica-
tions, literature, music, philr
osophy, theater.

In addition, the proposal stip-
ulated that PhysicalEducation
requirements be mainmined,

with completionasa prerequi-
site for graduation.

Between Sept. 1 and Oct. 12
position papers were submit-
ted to the faculty by Mssrs.
Erickson, Oelke, Kurtz, Kint-
ner, and Cleaver.

Kurz's positionrpaper-pro-
posal appears to advocate,
with reservations, the clot
felter proposal. It warns ag-
ainst the dangers of "educa‘
tional entrepreneurship", in-
tellectual faddishness and in-
tern divisional competition,
which he sees as detrimental

As Low TurnoulL Shows Apathy

by Jon Stein

On October 6 after conside-
rable discussion and modifie
cation the proposals for in-
creasing student involvement
in the College’s decision-mar
king process were submitted
to the student body. The pro-
posals were largely the work
of three ad hoc committees
and concerned the areas of

social policies and regula-
tions and counseling. Theproe
posals were reviewed and re-
fined by committee A (the
executive cabinet of S.G.A.,
the Deans, and the Chairman
of the Faculty), and are likely
to be approved by the presie
dent in the near future.

IN SHARP CONTRAST TO
THE HUGE TURNOUTS AT
LAST YEAR'S "STUDENT

Town-Gown To Clean Grinnell

by Mark Sableman

Several groups on campus
and in town who have been
working on improving town~
gown relations have set aside
Saturday, Oct. 24, as Commue
nity Day, a day for members
of the Grinnell community to
work together cleaning up Gr-
innell.

The impetus for Community

Day came from the Environ-
ment Committee of the Grin—
nell CommunityPlanning Coue
ncil, a group which includes
Rev. Michael Tan Creti of St.
Paul's Church and ﬁris Nell-
son of the college Develop—
ment Office. Father TanCreti
and Mr. Neilson spoke to the
Student Senate last month, and
later to a meeting ofstudents.

Rev. John Frykman, Dr. Roger Smith and Dr. Andrew Weil were participants in the
drug symposium sponsored here October I and 2. Rev. Frykman, who is a consulting
psychiatrist in Carmel, Calif., spoke Friday afternoon on the “brief therapy" treat-
ment he uses to treat a variety of problems, including bad drug trips. Dr. Smith, a
former criminologist who ran a treatment clinic in the midst of the HaightrAshbury
speed scene, spoke on the background and history of drug attitudes. Dr. Weil is ems
ployed by the National Institutes of Mental Health where he has been studying mari-
juana, and he talked about the ”uninteresting“ pharmacology of the psychoactive drugs.

dent Coordinator, who has
been in charge of most of the
preparation for Community
Day, said that about 70 Slud‘
ents have volunteered to work
so far, and the response from
toWn organizations has been
good. Townspeople and town
organizations and businesses
will contribute tools, equip-
ment, and paint, and towns-
people and students will work
together cleaning up road-
ways, clearing vacant lots,
and painting houses of selecr
ted citizens who are unable
to do it themselves.

Community Day is thought of
by its planners as an activity
that will be made intoa yearly
affair if the response thisyear
is good. William Deminoff,
Director of College Relations,
said he believes it is valuable
as a natural way for people
from the town and the college
to get together and understand
each other, while performing
a useful job for the whole com-
munity.

Deminoff is one ofthe college
representatives on a subcome
mittee of the Grinnell Human
Rights Commission which.is

is the other member, and a
woman student will be added
soon.) This committee plane

to a ”free enterprise educa-
tional system." He appears to
see such a freesenterprise,
"enterpreneurial" systemas
a natural development in the
absence ofa core curriculum.

What he proposes in theplace
ofa strict core curriculum,is
a modified form of divisional
requirement. All of the posi-
tion papers noted above favor
a divisional requirement of
one sort or another, thoughall
but Erickson’s put in a word
for one or anather sort of re
’quired freshman humanities
course.

Kurz’s paper emphasizes the
values and costs of freedom
and innovation. The education-
al value of student freedom of
choice is largely that once
students are allowed to vete
with their feet, courses are
obliged to be innovative and
attractive if they are to be
attended. At its extreme this
innovativeness becomes fadd
ishness, and the concept ofa
liberal education (and with it,
unfashionable courses and de-
partments) is lost in the shufe
fie. Therefore, the paper ad-
vocates freedom “within the
illusion of restraints”. What
this comes to is a prescripe
tive divisional‘ requirement
totalling 40 hours. Except for
a 4 hour Humanities course,
there are no specific course
requirements.

Mr. Cleaver’s paper allows
itself to be a “reserved en-
dorsement" of Kurz’s posir
tion. He does so, but adds to
this pleas for general educa-
tion (“versatility of skills”),
asking: "Is anybody who knows
less than everything freel”.
He nOtes, and quite rightly,
that the no-requirements pro-
posal requires improved ads
vising, and that the case for
that proposal rest "heavily"
on the assumption the adViS*
ing system is presently in-
adequate. He then pleads that
"For those of usesmost of
us '— who have watched the

. margins ofour lines getscribe
bled full ofmiscellaneous colr
lege chores by the end of two

or three years here, SXhOrEa’
tions cause alternate laughter
and tears.”

But the question of advising
remains central to the whole
argument. In Mr. Clotfelter's
original proposal, a distinct-
ion is made between fresh-
manesophomore and major
advising. It is with the former
that he finds most fault, pri—
marily because "the elaborr
ate system of requirements
seems to both the advisor and
the advisee to relieve them of
the necessity of talking about
anything important". He then
proposes, 1) more and better
curricular information to be
given to the student before he
arrives as a freshman: 2)
longer new student days, more
conducive to the formation of
a sound advisorradvisee re-
lationship, and 3) freedom, for
the student to changeadvisors
so as to insure a close rap-
port between student and ad»
visor.

The question is, which best
serves the student; an impro-
ved freshman requires currir
culum which will introduce
the student to many different
"ways men have devised to
order the confusion around
them", or a close, near‘tut
orial freshman advising sys-
tem, which would bring the
questions of generaleduaition
to the student, even before the
start of his first semester?
Nearly all of the position-pa-
pers advocate the continuance
of the humanities require-
ment, with some improvement
of freshman advising. Well,
back to business.

As we go to press, the Clots
felter Proposal appears dead
to all intents and purposes.
Its 4542 defeat was not pubs
lioally challenged, although
there appear from the running
head count based on previous
ballots of that meeting, to
have been more votes than
there were faculty members
present to vote. ‘

The faculty will begin this
Monday to consider the pros,
posal submitted byMiss Noble
for a distribution require-
ment, but without considering

deans, two facul members
and five students.

Greg Vranicar, Student Co
ordinator, introduced the
Committee on Student Ser»
vices, which will deal with
the dorms, the food we eat,
the health service, student
placement, and general mm-
pus programs. The member
ship would include the Dean
of Students, the Business Mae
nager, a faculty member and
four students. '

Mary Brooner, A.W.S. pre-
sident, praised the makeup of
the Committee on Counseling
for being ﬂexible and ”not
conducive to confrontation p0,
litics”. The main duty of the
committee would be to re
view and evaluate the existing
counseling program, as well

» as make changes. Brooner'
noted that the students do not
hold any thing close to equal
represennation on the commits

tee and also expressed doubts
about how the committee would
receive information or come
plaints from the students.
The meeting ended in a pre~
dictable fashion: students
locked in the old ”elitism
or apathy?" debate. A few
spoke out against the fact
that the senate appoints or is
included inall the committees;
however Loewi scoffed at the
criticism and complained that
any other system for selecting
student representatives would
be too "time comsuming”.
Perhaps the best summary of
the inherent spirit of the re
port came from the audience
when someone observed that
"this doesn’t appear to be
much ofa studentpowermove»
ment; it seems more like a
student government power
movement". True, true, but
the question ofthe week seems
to be whether or not our
student leaders realize, or
even care. So much for apathy.

its Physical Education provir
sions. Another proposaljoint»
1y sponsored by Mr. Jones
and Barry Zigas was distri—
buted to the faculty at the cone
'clusion of the Oct. lZmeeting.
Mr. Jones' proposal could be
thought of as a sort of imag-
inative compromise between
the positions of maintaining
Humanities and supplanting it
with improved freshman adr
vising. His motion would be:
“Each student is required to
complete the Freshman Tut-
orial Program." This would
be described as a "credit-
fail, non-classroom learning
experience to be completed in
the first semester of the fr—
eshman year". The tutor
would act as the freshman's
advisor, and would work
closely with the student in his
preparation ofa series of 85’
says and acquisition of inder
pendent study and writing sk-
ills.

This program, and its rat-
ionale, should cometo discus
sion next Monday in A.R.H.
Auditorium between 4 and 6
p.m. The faculty-senate mos
ves perforse slowly, but it
remains the best show in town.
All students are encouraged
to attend.

was successful. One particir
pant in that meeting, student
Senator Barry Zigas, also th~
ought it was helpful, but he
emphasized that mass meets
ings like that should not be
relied on as a continual thing.
The Human Rights Commis

sion Subcommittee is now 100- '

king for other ways to bring
town and college together to
create, in Deminoff's words,
"a real sense ofcommunity."
At their next meetingthe com-
mittee will mectwithfour cola
lege students, and the com-
mittee is working with other
groups to find other activities
for bringing about this sense
of community.

As well as the two town c0m*
mittees and the Community
Day group, a student senate
committee on Alumni rela-
tions has been expanded this
year to cover town andalumni
relations. The committee,
headed by Barry Zigas, has
been cooperating with the
other projects while planning
some new ways whereby it can
esmblish the “continual com~
munication" between townand
college that Zigas b‘elieves is
necessary. ”Too often in the
past," he said "we have only
made efforts to communicate
in crisis situations, and con-
sequently people haven’t lise
tened."

One of the innovations that
the Senate committee is work-
ing on is the establishment of
a college speakers bureau 115*
ting faculty and students with
expertise in certain fields who

would be willing to talkto town
organizations. Also, the com-
mittee is interested in having
radio shows on KGRN, the
Grinnell commercial station,
writing a column in the Grins
nell Herald Register, and dis
tributing the Herald Register
on campus.

Bucks Jones Plan

As the Great Faculty Requirements Debate heads into its
sixth (or is it seventh?) week the casual observer is ata
loss as to what to expect next. Two variations of the major
proposals have been defeated and some are beginning to
wonder if a majority of the faculty can be formed behind
any proposal. At the close of Monday‘s meeting (in which
the faculty spent an hour and a half discussinga distribu~
tional proposal that no one proved to be interested in).
Professor Alan R. Jones stepped into the void with an amend-
ment to the Clotfelter (the so—mlled ”no-requirements")
proposal tl-at seems to answer the major objections to that
document.

Arguments against the Clotfelterproposalincludedallegations
that it was negative in tone, that it presented freshmen stu-
dents with no guidelines for choosing a program, and that it
was based on the shaky premise that the underclass advising
system would be greatly improved. The Jones amendment
answers each of these objections although it cannot counter
those who disagree with the basic philosophy of "no require-
ments" (23 out of 90 in a straw vote four weeks ago) and
who argue that there is a certain deﬁnable body of knowledge
that all liberal arts students should be exposed to before
graduating.

The Jones amendment calls for the institution ofa required
Freshman Tutorial program which he describes as follows:

"The Freshman Tutorial Program is a credit-fail
non-classroom learning experience to be completed
in the first semester of the freshman year. Each
student will work closely with his faculty tutor in
preparing a series of essays during the semester,
'and the aim of the program is to introduce entering
students into a new learning experience emphasizing
independent study and writing skills. Satisfactory
completion of» the program will carry four credits.
The turor will also act as the student‘s underclass
academic adviser. "

The proposal gets to the heart of the advising problem and
also provides the writing skills course that many professors
feel is necessary for freshmen. It is far superior to the Hu-
manities requirement (standing alone) in that it emphasizes
skills over facts, an emphasis that many feel liberal arts
in general should echo. In addition Grinnell has long needed
a program to enable its students to make the transition from
traditional high school fare to Grinnell’s emphasis on inde-
pendent study. None of the current requirements even ap-
proaches this need. .

The Jones amendment to the revised Clotfelter proposal
adds a strong positive note to a proposal which enables Grin-
nell to come closer to the ideal we seekna strong personal

liberal arts education. . -

Hits Initiative Fund

by J.c. Labowltz

The Initiative Fund has come
up with a new set ofguidelines
that they are using to give away
our money, and they are a lot
of fun. it seems thatDougMen-
denhall and the gang have de-
cided to emphasize "creative
and innovative activities" in
their allocation of our social
funds, which are part of the
$47 student activities fee that
we all pay and from which all
good things flow (SGA, con<
certs, etc.). What exactly is
meant by "creative and inno-
vative” is rather vague, but
as I understand it, the empha-
sis will be away from the tra~
dltional form of social activi-
ties that have been funded in
the past.

Part of the impetus behind
this is the definite policy set
down by "collegeauthorities"
that no alcohol be purchased
by the college, directly or in*
directly, due to the leyl imtL
piications of such an act. This
will also mean thatthe college
will not honor such practices
of the past as turning in re-
ceipts for $59 and claiming
that this was for potato chips

1 certainly have no quarrels
over this issue of alcohol. (I
did have lots of quarrels with
it, but it was patiently pointed
out to me that I was fighting
the Iowa Criminal Code so i
no longer have any quarrels.)

‘ What I raise questions about
is the idea that social activi-
ties have to be "creative and
innovative" in order to be
worthy of being funded. I have
already' heard of one instance
'where Gary Dike threwa party
for iupeople (an old-fashioned
type party which at least 41

people here seem to enjoy)
and when he applied for ini-
tiative funds, was told thattoo
few people attended to warrant
money. Now my roommate,
Cralger Miller (Grand island,
Nebraska. bats right, throws
right) saw the Red Balloon on
Sunday, and is fired up to buy
a an of helium and some bal-
loons and pass them around.
Lois of fun, and definitely cr-
eative. Al Jones' Utopia class
is going to the Amanas for
lunch which is filling if not
downright creative and inno-
vative.

My point is that social con-
cerns and activities of a great
many members of the campus
community are being deter-
mined by a non-elective body
that may not have been desig‘
ned to do that, and that “ille-
gitimate social activities",
traditional, nonrcreative, or
highly imaginative, may be re?
jected and refused funding.
And, on the other hand, acti-
vities that may not warrant
the use of student fees maybe
funded simply because they
are unique.

What I seem to be saying to

the idea being tint the stud-

Group Urges Curricular Reform;
Debate Centers 0n Requirements

This summer a specialcom-
mittee of 11 faculty and ad
ministrators studied several
plans for curricular reform,
concentrating on a11~college
requirements, with the intent
of recommending specific
proposals for curricular re-
form to the faculty this fall.
The study group was unable to
reach a concensus on a gen'
eral plan forall requirements,
but it did suggestseverai spe-
ciﬁc changes in the present
structure which were adopted
by the faculty to be effective
immediately.

The .committee grew from
the desire of faculty mem—
bers and students lastsemes-
ter to reevaluate the present
curriculum as it concerned
allrcollege requirements-and
to make changes where they
were warranted. Discussions
last semester, among stud-
ents and faculty and within
departments and divisions,
had divided most people am-
ong three major positions on
reform: 1) those favoring the
Clotfelter “no-breadth" re
quirements proposal, 2) those
favoring distribution require-
ments, and #3) those favoring
the present, structured requ-
irements. The study Commit
tee, which had been appointed

by the Dean at the end of last '

semester, had hoped to reach
agreement on one of these
proposals or a modification
and submit that to the faculty.

However, even after the stu-

dy group did research on the ‘

changing thinking about requ-
irements that has been going
on at colleges and universi-
ties throughout the country, it
was unable to reachany better
consensus than when it smrt-
ed. The final recommendation
to the faculty on majorreform
was a nine page report outlin-
ing the threeproposals (inclu-
ding two different distribution
requirement schemes) and the
rationales for each of them.
The summer study committee
urged the faculty to make it
their first business this sem-
ester to debate each of these
proposals in turn. and make a
final decision this semester.
The faculty is in the process
of doing that now.

On a more concrete level, the
committee agreed. with little
or no disagreement, to re-
commend to the faculty four
changes in the present curri—
culum. These proposals were
adopted by the faculty at their
first meeting this semester.

The first change was theelie
mination of the upperclass ge-
neral education requirement,
or minor. It was considered
overly restrictive. and some-
times ridiculous in the way it
was administered.

. rings unless

The committee also agreed
that it should be possible to
bake the science and social
science requirements any
time before the end of the jun-
ior year. This was a recogni—
tion of an already lenient pol-
icy of the Committee on Aca-

demic Smnding toward grant- .

ing delays, as well as a move
to put more flexibility into the
curriculum. Also, two Physics
courses were added to the list
of courses which satisfy the
physical science requirement.

The third proposal of the
summer study committee was
for formal recognition ofthree
types of majors: depart-
mental, interdisciplinary, and
independent. All of thesemaj-

ors had already existed, but :3.
by making them more formal, '
the faculty opened the way for
more independent majors,and 5"
the expansion of such minors L,
as Religious studies and pos- c
sibly Urban Studies into inter» k,
disciplinary majors.

Finally, a fourth recommen-
dation was incorporated into ‘.
the committee’s report to the ‘
faculty at the suggestion of
the SGA cabinet, with which
the study committee and the
Trustees met for severaldays a"
at the end ofthe summer. This .
student-backed proposal was .,
for the establishment of a ‘
committee to study the devel- t

, opment of descriptive course}:

SGA Asks Referendum

On JudicialBroposal

by John Gardner

The Senate has recentlybeen

working on new proposals for
hall judicial councils and for
a campus judicial council.
Their proposals will be con-
mined in a studentrbody re-
ferendum to be distributed
50011.

The present ideas for re-
organizing the judicial coun-
cils' workings have been re-
vised from a set of propo-
sals which failed referendum
passage last semester by a
little less than two percent
(58.7% out of a needed 60%).
Greg Vranicar, Student Co-
ordinator, says that the fai-
lure of the proposals was
partly due to the definition
of "open hearings" that was
made, partly due to the large
abstention vote. (Abstentions
had been defined not to in-
clude empty ballots.) These
earlier referendum propo-
sals, however, have much in
common with the current ones.

Both are geared toward set»
ting up hearings for students
who are accused of violating
college or dorm rules, or
who initiate cases against
dorms for violation of their
rights under the Student Bill
of Rights. There are three
basic changes:

Firsr, the definition of "open
hearings" has been changed
from an audience of twenty
people (the first twenty who
show up at the hearing) to
about 72 people (the capacity
of Fine Arts 104). The basic
idea for even this limitation
is to preserve a fairly or-
derly atmosphere in which
the defendant pleads his case;
also. peoplewill not beallowed
to speak at campus~wide hea»
they are wit-
nesses.

Second, the Senate has re-
organized the composition of
the judicial council to include
three students and two facul‘ ,
ty members, instead of three '\
stydents and three faculty 5.
members. This change is de- .'
signed to prevent hung votes ,
and also to support a trial-
by»peers concept while inclu»
ding faculty viewpoint. ‘

Third, the review power of f;
the campus judicial council
has been more clearly defined.
The judicial council will have '
power to rule on the validity ‘
of any regulation where the '
regulation conﬂicts with one
of three basic documents ‘-
the SGA constitution, the Stu-
dent Bill of Rights or any
statute of civil law. This pro-
posed definition would give a
student the power, for exam-
ple, of appealing to the ju-
dicial council if a hall was ~
violating his right, under the ,7
student Bill of Rights, tosieep ’-
in his room at any time. 9’-
When the council determines
that a rule has been broken or
that the Bill of Rights is being
infringed in some case, the
next step isa recommendation
to the President, on the facts
of the situationandany punish-
ment to be meted out.

i OCTOBER 16,-‘1970

Dr. Koenig To Be
In lecture Series

Dr. Myron Koenig, retired
Dean of the State Department's
Foreign Service Institute and
a Grinnell graduate, will be
here this Monday, October 19,
to speak in “The Department
of State and the AcademicCo-
mmunity."

Dr. Koenig has extensive ex-
perience as an educator in the
university as well as at the
Department of Smte. After
getting his B.A. from Grinnell
and M.A. and Ph.D. from the
University of Iowa, he taught
in Iowa at Grinnell, the Uni-
versity of Iowa, and Gus Cole
lege for twelve years, and at
George Washington University
in Washington, D.C., where
he was Professor of Anglo:‘
American History and Dean
of the Undergraduate College,
for thirteen years. His spe-
cial academic interests are
in geopolitics and American
and British hiStory.

After two years with the St-
ate Department as a cultural
attache in London, Dr. Koe-
nig joined the staff of the Sch-
ool of Foreign Affairs at the
State Department in 1958. Th-
ere, as Associate Dean and
later as Dean,» he was in ch-
arge of all academic prog-
rams, staff, and curriculum.

Dr. Koenig's lecture, to be
held in the South Lounge at
8:00 p.m. Monday, will be the
first major lecture under an
informal speakers program
initiated this year by Steve
Grow. It should prove of in-
terest for Mr. Koenig's views
on education and the foreign
service.

Myths 0n Pregnancy, Abortion

by Debby McKnight

The pregnancy turns out to be

_ Modernired Bookstore Opens,

, ‘ Gets‘McBee As New Manager

Grinnell's new bookstore op-
ened August 30 with a new
manager, Mr. Thomas McBee.
McBee, who inheriteda rather
difficult situation last June,
has ambitiously set about im-
proving the bookstore. He
feels very strongly that the
bookstore should serve the
students and be responsive to
their criticisms and ideas. He
also feels that communica-
tions between the bookstore
and the administration, fac-
ulty, and students is extreme-
ly important.

The main problem of college
tookstores today, says McBee,
is the lack of progressive and
competent management. Too
many bookstores are now as
they were twenty years ago.
Because the need for an ade-
quate bookstore is so import
ant to the college, great ef-
forts should be made to see
that Grinnell has a good book-
store.

Its new manager says thathe
would like to see Grinnell have
a bookstore "as good as any
in the country for a college
this size."

The annex to the bookstore
was designed to blend withthe
Skidmore, Owings and Mer-
ril designs of the Forum and
library. A Des Moines cone
SlI'LlCliOn company built the st-
ructure's shell and Grinnell's
physical plant employees did
most of the remaining work.
This included much of the inn
terior and fixtures which Mc-
Bee estimates saved at least
a half of the building’s poten-
tial cost. Work did not start
in earnest until June, sothere
was considerable pressure to
be done by the opening date of
Aug. 30. The store did open
on time but work is still con-

‘ tinuing on the interior fixtures
and the set up and display of

books, as well as on the ex-
terior.

Mr. McBee feels thatthepri-
mary function of a bookstore
is to sell texts. Supplies and
sweatshirts are secondary. He
also wishes to add more sup-
plementary texts and broaden
the available selection.

McBee, who has worked in
several college bookstores
and a private store, wishes to
try new ideas here at Grin-
nell and is always willing to
meet with people and listen to
any of the criticisms of the
store.

Theater Season To Begin Sunday

by Ann Casseit

The theater department he
gan its performing program
on Sunday, October 4, with
the play The Death of Faust,
directed by Ned Donahoe. The
theatre will continue its pr0*
gram of plays witha restor-
ation comedy by William Wy-
cherley, The Country Wife,
under the direction of Mrs.
Voertman on October 22, 23,
and 24.

The Country Wife was writ-
ten in 1675 and is a comment
on English societyatthattime.
The story concerns a man who
hires a quack doctor to spread
the rumor that he has had a
social disease and has been
rendered impotent. He feels
that if he can convince all the
husbands of the society ladies
that his story is true, they
will have no qualms about let-
ting him near their lovely
wives. His feeling proves to
be correct and he proceeds
to seduce and have affairs
with many ladies who, before

though obviously not one we
would want programmed into
everyone's life."

In an undesired pregnancy,

_the alternatives are comples

tion or abortion. Both were
discussed by Dr. Evalyn Gen-
del in the first session of this
year's Sex Education Confer-
ence on October 8. Approxi-
mately fifty students and re-
sident advisors gathered in
South Lounge for the informal
lecture-queStion and answer
presentation. Dr. Gendel's
impressive credentials in-
clude a position with the Di-
vision of Maternal and Child
(lire of the Kansas State Bo-
ard of Health, an assistant
clinical professorship in pre-
ventive medicine at the Uni~
versity of Kansas, and asso~
ciation with SIECUS, the na-
tional organization for sex
education.

Informative and exciting, the
session cleared up several
myths about pregnancy, abor‘
tion, and adoption. Dr. Gendel
concentrated particularly on
the social implications of the
newly liberalized abortion

this time, he had found un-
approachable.

Even today this situation cou-
ld be the basis for hilarious
antics. Imagine the fun they
had with it back in 1675. As
Steven H. Rubin (who?) says
in the introduction to the play,
"It is at once ﬂagrantly ribald
and libertine, and unconven»
tionally but discernably more
al,” or if you prefer it in
Mrs. Voertman’s words, "It's
a dirty play."

A few observations about the
Grinnell production of The
Country Wife are in order.
The scenery was designed by
sophomore Mark Shanstrom
and special music is ‘being
composed by David Wooldrige
of Grinnell’s music depart
ment. A large percentage of
the cast is freshmen; only
four members of the cast,
Larry Grimm, Jim Spell,Ma-
ry Brown, and Greg Gaines,
have ever been seen on the
Grinnell stage before. All the
rest are novices, including
the leading character who is
being played by Don Boros,

laws. For example, 80% of
Amerimn abortions are per-
formed for womenwho already
have one child. Since most of
these women are not widows
or divorcees, Dr. Gendel be-

Student-faculty
Ratio Increased

Definitely noticeable in the
housing crunch, the size of
the freshman class, and the
reduction in the number of
faculty, the student-faculty
ratio at Grinnell this year has
been raised significantly. At
the end of last year the stu-
dent-faculty ratio was down to
9.2, but this fall was raised
to 11.3.

Although Dean Wall, in 8 sp-
eech before the faculty, gave
evidence ofa growinginterest
on the part of students in the
Social Sciences. three Social
Science departments lost me-
mbers this year. Ecomomics
and History dropped by one,
while Political Science drop-
ped by two. French and Span-
ish both dropped by one, and
the English department exper-
ienced the biggest reduction
of all, losing four members.

The biology department gai-
ned one professor, while the
rest of the Science depart-
ments and the Fine Arts de-
partments remained the same.

Small liberal arts colleges
are feeling an impending fin<
ancial crisis and realize that
this may not be solved by
eternally raising the tuition
rates. Thus, the studentfac-
ulty ratio atmany collegesac-
ross the country is being rai-
sed. The administration of
Grinnell ls accomplishing this
through both avenues open to
them: a reduction in the size
of the faculty and a sharp in»
crease‘in the number of stu-
dents.

Academic Improvement Plan
Recipient 0! $200,000 Grant

GRINNELL, IA. ‘- Grinnell
College is the recipient of a
$200,000 grant from the An-
drew W. Mellon Foundation of
New York City, President
Glenn Leggett announced tee
day.

The Mellon grant, which re»
sulted from a proposal pre-
pared by the Grinnell Office
of Development, will help
support the program of edu-
cation in the humanities in-
cluded in the college‘s Aca-
demic Improvement Master-
plan (AIM).

The grant continues support
of Grinnell’s educational pro-
gram initiated by a predec-

a new member of Grinnell's
theatre department.

The theatre department's
next presentation will be an
experimental children's thea-
tre production directedby Don
Boros. The production dates
are November 13 and 14 in
the Arena Theatre and per
formances are planned for
the elementary schools in the
Grinnell area.

The play is based on the
story of Snow White and the
Seven Dwarfs, but the script
is being written entirely by
the actors as they rehearse
and improvise. The success
of the play depends entirely
on the actors’ ingenuity and
creativity. Right now they are
trying to understand how a
child's mind works (which sh-
ouldn't be hard for Grinnell
students) by playing children's
games andstudyingtheactions
of children. The process is

entirely experimental and is ‘

designed to teach the actors,
as well as the audience, about
what is really involved in
theatre.

essor of the Mellon Founda-
tion, Dr. Leggett noted. The
Old Dominion Foundation,wh<
ich was merged with the Ava?
ion Foundation into the An-
drew W. Mellon Foundation
in 1969, gave Grinnell $50,
000 for the upgrading of ﬁsc-
ulty salaries in 1965 and aw-
arded the college an addition-
al $100,000 in ‘1967 for the
expansion of faculty study and
research opportunities in the
humanities and fine arts.

Noting that Grinnell is one
of 15 liberal arts colleges in»
cluded in the Mellon Founda-
tion's current program of aid
to higher education, Dr. Leg-
gett said, "This grant under-
lines Grinnell's nationwide
reputation as a college offer-
ing educational opportunities
of the highest quality. Thepo-
sitive response by the Mellon
Foundation to our request for
support is in keepingwithpre~
vious efforts of the Old Dom-
inion and Avalon Foundatlons
to Strengthen the country's
independent colleges."

AIM, which was inaugurated
at Grinnell in 1967, is a com-
prehensive program designed
to meet both the immediate
and long—range needs of the
college.

The five-year $10 million
first phase provides for the
acceleration of academic of-
ferings in all disciplines thr-
ough‘new teaching projects,
expanded research opportun-
ities for both Students and
faculty, the purchase of more
sophistimted science equip-
ment, and the expansion of
library holdings.

Higher faculty salaries and
an accelerated program of
student financial aid are also
being funded by AIM, as are
new construction projects and
the rennovation of older cam-
pus buildings.

Urges Repeal Of Abortion Lows

(Continued from page 5)

lieves that the courts wilisoon
face the question: "What are
the rights of a father when
the mother wants to he abor-
ted but the man wants the
child?"

Of course, liberal abortion
laws will solve more problems
than they create. The chief
beneﬁt expected is destruc-
tion of the criminal abortion
business. Besides classic
tales of infection and hemorr
rage, Dr. Gendel revealed that
many abortions are performed
on women who are not really
pregnant. Criminal abortion-
ists are net concerned with
details. As Dr, Gendel said,
“Criminal abortion is a reef
ket. It'saboutmakingmoney.“
Since the demand for aborn
tions will not just go away, a
realistic society should pro
tect women from such abuse.
Dr. Gendel contends that lib—
eralized laws stem from this
recognition. They attempt to
rectify an old double sland'
ard - n0t between male and
female , but rather a discre-
pancy between:

“women with money who'

could always have a good,
clean abortion and the poor
who were exposed to degran
dation or even death when
seeking an abortion. "

Liberal abortion laws are
some improvement, but id-
eally- Dr. Gendel and others
of her profession want "to
see all abortion laws repealed
because it's not a legal issue;
it is a medical issue between
patient and doctor."

Despite tremendous rain, the
Conference’s second session,
"Interpersonal Relations,"
drew a large crowd. Dr. Gena
del's responses to questions
were based on her bSIIEf that
"there is a sexual system ap-
art from the reproductive sys*
tem since those two functions
have been separated in recent
times." To deal creatively
with this new freedom, Dr.
Gendel urged an emphasis on
"the mutuality of roles and
the likeness of the sexes."
Sex must become generally
human, net something rigidly
defined by social roles. Dr.
Gendel asserted that little

boys have been put into boxes
as crippling as those little
girl's occupy. Both must be
freed to act as human beings,
n0t types. Specifically in re
ference to a sexual relation-
ship, Dr. Gendel stressed the
need for constant communica-
tion between partners. Since
old stereotypes are gone, in
their place people have great
opportunities for individual
development if they only com~
munioate.

Dr. Gendel saw no evidence
of an increase in sexual acti-
vity because of the muchrdis
cussed “sexual revolution."
Instead, she noted a new wil-
lingness to discuss sexuality
and a new tolerance ofvarying
sexual standards; As support,
she cited changing reactions
to the famous Masters and
Johnson sexuality studies.
Five years ago, the first
results were published and
greeted with a storm of mail,

half of it disapproving. When

Human Sexual lnadequa cy was
recently published, only a
handful of letters condemned
the study.

Mention of Masters and jo-
hnson prompted some aud~
ience attack on the project
for taking a ”mechanical"atr
titude toward sexuality.

Having worked with MaSters
and Johnson, Dr. Gendel was
in a good position to defend
their work by explaining just
what they wanted to learn and
how they actually went about
it. The gathering concludedas
she reminded the audience:

"We talk a 10t about human
relationships, but we don‘t
really know anything about
them." Masters and Johnson
are trying to fill some of the
gaps. Whilemore humane life
styles are developing, "we
have not left the oldstandards
completely behind. It will all
Lake time."

Art Acquisition Committee
To Select College Collection

The Art Acquisitions Com—

annual budget of about three
thousand dollars a year, drawn
from the Samuel R. Rosenthal
Fund and donated by Mr. Ro-

The bulk of the acquisitions
are contemporary prints and

Biology Department Gets Grant

GRINNELL, IA. “e Grinnell
College has receiveda MI ,700
National Science Foundation
grant for cooperative compu-
ter-oriented curricular devr
elopment in biology, President
Glenn Leggett has announced.

The work at Grinnell, sched-
uled for a 267month period
ending in the fall- of 1972,
will be directed by Benjamin
F. Graham, Jr., professor of
biology.

Similar N.S.F. grants for the
biology project have been aWV
arded to Central College, C17
arke College, and the Univer-
sity of lowa.

The National Science Foun'
dation is also supporting a
parallel cooperative compu-
terroriented curricular pro-
gram in mathematics, which
is being developed by the Un-
iversity of Iowa, Augustsna
College (Illinois), Dubuque
University, Iowa Wesleyan

College, and Marycrest Cole
lege.

Curricular development in
the two areas will be corret
lated through an existing com-
puter network centered at the
University of Iowa.

In biology, the work will fo-
cus on the development of a
two-semester course tenta-
tively titled “An Introduction
to Computing Methods in Bias
logy" and the preparation of
“A Handbook of Computer
Applications in Biology."

"The course will probably
be aimed at the sophomore-
junior level of college work,
in the hope that it willprovide
a foundation for continuedstu-
dy in advanced undergraduate
courses, student research,
and graduate work," Dr. Gra-
ham said.

ram collections. Themostre-
cent gift included three mode
ern prints given by the Re
public Insurance Company of
Des Moines.

The Committee met lastyear
and bought some prints of the
London Graphica Company. It
will meet againsometime this
fall. All of the prospective
acquisitions are lined up in
the basement of the Fine Arts
Building, and each member
looks over them individually
to select the one he prefers.
The Committee then meets
in a group and determines the
final selections by concensus.
Before the committee was
formed two years ago, the art
department assembled the
college's collection. Mr. Cer-
vene still remains the com—
mittee’s most active member.

The body of art owned by the
college is growing quite large
and it is hoped that sometime
in the future, when funds be-
come available, a museum
will be built for it. Until then,
pictures will be made avail—
able for faculty and adminis-
tration ofﬁces, and will be

The main function of theStu*
dent Publications Committee
is to oversee and provide gui-
dance for all communication
media financed by the college.
Presently the committee has
jurisdiction over the Scarlet
and Black, Kch, and the lit’
erary magazine.

In addition, members appoint
editors and business mana-
gers of the publications, and
Station manager, business
manager, and chief engineer
of KDIC. They take responsi-
bility for any legal action and
also set broad policy on fin-
ancial and business manage-
ment. Funds come from the
SGA and soliciting of ads.

According to Mr. David Jor'
clan, chairman, the committee
does not censor. Members
determine the broad limits of
policy. The committee inclur
des Mr. Jim Hottois, Mr.
Henry Klein, Clayton Lee,
Mike Lipsman, and Sue Orinr
gel.

They have appointed Greg
Butcher and Jim Friend as
editor and business manager,
respectively, of the Swrlet
and Black. The KDICpositions
were filled last spring.

Mr. Jordan said that, altlr
ough it is too late for a year-
book this year, the commit»
tee is looking for people in’
terested in starting one next
year. He also mentioned the
possibility of publishing the
literary magazine several tie
mes a year with the Scarlet
and Black.

To make Students aware of
SGA affairs, the student co-
ordinator’s office is present-
ing a series on the seven stue
dent—faculty committees;.Ad-

The GDIC this week issued
the following bulletin concer-
ning changes in the order of
call for induction:

President Nixon recently is-
sued an executive order af~
fecting the order of call for
induction. While only a few
men will be affected by it, its
provisions should be common
knowledge.

According to the new order
of call, there are seven class
ses of priority for induction.
Only men in the first three of
these seem likely tobe called.

Class 1) Volunteers whohave
not attained the age of 26 in
the sequence in which tthey
have volunteered for induc~
tion.

Class 2) Non-volunteers in
the Extended Priority Selec-
tion Group (see below) in the
order of their lottery numbe
ers.

Class 3) Nonrvolunteers in
the First Priority Selection
Group in order of their lot:
tery numbers. Probably only
about half the men in this gre
oup can expect to be called
next year.

The Extended Priority is
something new. It consists of
registrants who on Dec. 31
were members of the First
Priority Group whose lottery
numbers had been reachedbut
who had not been issued in-
duction orders.

Men in this group will be eli-
gible to receive induction or-
ders up until April 1 of the
year following their entry into
the First priority group. In
Other words, if a man enters
the First Priority group in
November of this year with a
number which has already
been called, but does not re*

ceive an induction order be
cause his board’s quota is al-
ready filled with higher num-
bered men, he may receive an
induction order in the first
three months of 1971, and, in
fact, must be called before
any men in the 1971 First
Priority Group.

The other new development
is that a man who reachesage
26 without having received an
induction order will not get
one, even if his case had been
on appeal at the time he be-
come 26. So, barring agen-
eral mobilization, 26 is the
deadline.

People with questions about
this order, or about any facet
of the draft are encouraged
to come and receive any coun-
seling they may need.

Group Announces
landscape Plans

The College landscaping
committee, made up of Mr.
Graham, Mr. Zirkle, Mr. Ha»
Wu, and Mr. lambie and ads
vised by Mr. L. Herbert Ty-
ler, a professional consultant,
sees its principle work this
fall in landscaping the new
physical education complex.

The committee members we-
‘re appointed by President
Leggett and are aided inplanr
ning and carrying outprojects
by fourteen students, whom
Mr. Graham termed "a re-
serve of muscles". They are
operating on an initial budget
of $30,000.00 donated by par-
ents and friends of the college
for the specific purpose of
replacing the fifty or so elms
lost each year to the blight,
and for otherwise beautifying
the campus.

Although their responsibili-
ties include campus lighting,
.sidewalk planning, and ornar
mentation of the campus, the
committee members are con-
centrating for the moment on
planting trees. In particular,
they plan an extensive wind-
break around the new track,
using a double row of trees:
a row of fifteen-foot cedars
encircled by a low euonymus
hadge which will turn a bril‘
liant red in the fall.

The committee envisions a
sculpture garden outside the
Fine Arts Building sometime
in the future, and although
they have net yet acquired
any sculptures, the commits

.tee has begun planning in an

ticipation.

Plans for a marker on the
site of the old Heating Plant
chimney also continue to ger-
mlnate.

Can we do it? After four
league outings, Grinnell's
stalwart eleven, the hippie
Pioneers, have checkmated
their opponents thrice. The
three trump cards have been
dealt to Coe, Lawrence, and
Carleton in Grinnell’s sans
ctum sanctorum, beautiful
Ward Field, overlooking the
picturesque Unfinished Gym
Complex; Grinnell was aced
by Monmouth on a foreign
field of endeavor.

Grinnell’s triumphs (and, in-
deed, the sole momentoftheir
undoing) have each been mars
ked by closeness. Grinnelldes
feated Coe by less than a
touchdown (while scoring only
one touchdown, themselves)
as telling defensive plays
made the day.

Close competition entertain-
ed the multitudinous fans ags
alnst Lawrence as Grinnell

won by a naked two points.
This time Grinnell had to
come from behind, and then
hang on, to pull out their se-
cond victory.

Against Carleton, Grinnell
had (eventually) an easy time
of it. Bad hands and an inter-
ception caused the offense to
sputter in the first half, but
the Pioneers held a soiree in
the second half as they finally
overcame the hapless Qirles
ton team 3377.

Against Monmouth Grinnell’s
offense could muster little,
and two touchdowns alongwith
the referees proved too great
an obstacle to overcome as
the Pioneers lost 1376.

A puissant defense appears
to be the key this year, as it
was laSt year. The offense,
led by "Gorgeous”sGary J07
hnson and "Fireplug" Mario,
appears unable to score con-

sistently on its own shadow.
The defense, however, led by
"Clothesline" Alston, who
hangs his opponents out to
dry, "Bubble" Barry Huff,
who just sort of wanders thr-
ough the interference, and
"Darling” Bill Dicks, whose
hands have already found a
number of arrant aerials, ap*
pears capable of stopping any
assailant. Nevertheless, any
defense can be erroded when
it plays three quarters per
game.

The offense may go, hoiw
ever. Head Coach Edd BowV
ers is holding sophomore
"Marvelous" Marty Gilllehan
in reserve. He is currently
gaining invaluable experience
in the defensive secondary.
Gilliehan has provedhis worth
by coming in against Carlee
ton in the fourth quarter and
firing two touchdown strikes.
All in all, if the offense mn
learn to score consistently,
even against good opponents,
and if the defense can continue
to hold up, the Grinnell Pion—
eers should not remain the
underrated team they appear
to have become. '

Despite a surprising number
of crippling injuries, medical
school interviews, high school
homecomings and Jewish holir
days, the Grinnell soccer
squad has managed to post a
3.1 record so far this year.
The first game proved to be
a warmsup, as the pioneers
trounced a talented but very
inexperienced team from Ce-

weekend at Knox, the Grin*
nellians fell prey to a rough
field and an accurate short

to ram in second half goals
to bring Grinnell to a come

IMCO ER

Grinnell's IM football sea
son seems to lack something
this year; enough teams, ens
ough referees and enough cons
trol over the cretins of the
gridiron: Clark, OC, and
North. The season is lacking
a great deal of organization
in that halls cannot find the
fields upon which they are
supposed to scrimmage. And
even if they do find the field,
the poorly paid referees do
not.

This year, there is only a
four-team league, essential-
ly. Clark, without their leass
hes, is a match for the fresh-
man team with pads. Read,
who is also undefeated and
truely the only gentlemen of
the game, have found their
way in spite of Coach School-
er. 0C is composed of Grin-
nell’s answer to Ohio State;
they really get "high" for
their games. And North, the
“soul squad," have fought
diligently, behind or ahead.
The intelligence award this
year goes to the Cleveland
Langan team. After Clark
dismembered the West Norr
ris, Squad (7) 7076, Clever

not to show up. .

A Conference Championship
appears in the realm ofpossis

team proceeds through the
1970 campaign. Led by head-
jogger Eric Jahn andhis side~
kick “Shortcut” McGrath, the
team has gone unscathed thr-

ough the dual meet season and-

finished a “high" third in
their “nemesis", the Les
Duke Invitational. Fallen in
their tracks have been teams
of C06, Graceland, William

Faith Baptist Bible College
(7). The "thinnies" were spin
ked by Augustanna andSt. Olaf
in our home spectacular.

Experience is the key to their
success with six upperclass-
men in the ranks. Besides the
dynamic duo, there is Jon
Stein, Oscar Rattenborgi John
Russel and Doug Mendenhall,
who does alright for a pole
vaulter. Prep power is sup-
plied by Phil Frank and Rusty
Dawson. The loss of senior

Tim Power due to a painful
injury is noted as a loss to
the overall power (7).

In spite of competition from
some nutty professors and
humiliation by Coach O'sninth
grade son, these young men
insist that they will finish in
one of the top two spots in the
finale. Top challenger to their
possible pinnacle position in
the conference is St. Olaf.

Alums Visit Campus
, To Trade One-liners

by Jim Alt

The Returnrto-Campus pro-
gram, September 12-13, was
designed to keep "open lines
of communication" between
alumni and the campus. After
the first day of conferences,
panels, and a cocktail party
the alumni had informalvisits
with students at the various
RA'S suites. The raps which
developed were, if nothing
else, highly memorable:

“Do you believe in nuclear
war7"—r(class of thirty).

"I think you all study more
than we did, but you take it
all so seriously."h(class of
fifty).

“Did you lcnow that goldfish
are really undergrown carp?"
"(class of sixty).

Along with suchheavies were
casual inquiries concerning
the closing of the college last
May and the extent ofdruguse
on campus. We did prettywell
(the alumni seemed to think) in
justifying our actions of last
spring. It seems thatthe emo-
tions which flowed so freely
at the time can be quickly re—
called to the defense of that
episode.

Orr efforts were somewhat
less effective in "explaining
the drug situation." Some ale
umni were dismayed to hear
the belief that "marijuana
doesn't really lead straight
to heroin," and that "marl-
juana use doesn’t necessarily
mean a drug problem." Per
haps of greater interest is the
observation that the alumni
always referred to the weed
as "pot” or “grass,” while
we studiously used the term
“marijuana." So who’s cool?
Meanwhile, we were enlighte
ened with stories ofGrinnell‘s
past. Like ”Spring Riots" (an
acceptable jag back in the good
old days), or the time all of
SAGA’s silverware disap
peared, to be discovered at

Auction To Benefit

King Scholarships

The Martin Luther King, Jr.

World University Service
Auction is to be held this Sat-
urday, at 9:30 p.m., in Darby
Gymnasium. Traditionally the
funds from this auction have
gone to the World University
Service to facilitate the vari~
ous programs that the WUS
maintains. With the inception
of the Martin Luther King
Scholarship fund, however,
the proceeds from the aUCtion
have been divided in a ratio
of,three to one in favor of the
scholarship fund. A major
consideration for the distrie
bution of the funds is the mat-
ching fund that the alumni
have provided. The alums
match every dollar given to
the scholarship fund, doub-
ling the overall effectiveness
of any contribution made.

Campus used to be all male,
and South all female, and ne
ver the twain did . . .

Admittedly, it isn't fair to
take Off-[116‘ cuff remarks out
of context, just to have fun.
So here are some excerpts
from these same alumni’s
class letters which have fall-
en into our possession. One
of the best, and certainlynews
to the S&B:

". . . the college is not pubr
lishing the 5&8 this yearr-it
is having a rest until the fin-
ancial situation is better.
(This may not be the entire
reason.)”- (pre twenties).

On our appearance:

"I would add that I’m not at
all smitten with the style of
clothes theywearor theirbare
feet . . . (but) i saw several
girls very properly attired,
let me advise." --(pre twenr
ties). ;

"The kids at Grinnell are
functionally dressed, and I
must confess that some of it
strikes me as downright funs
ny. NO[ charming, however."
- , (forties).

Qt coed dorms:

“They do have separate bath
rooms."~(twenties).

“The women seem to have
had a good effect on themen.”
- - (forties).

"And since there are no
hours for anyone, there is a
regular free exchange of occu-
pants of the rooms. Ifyou know
what I mean. Iguess we had
the same arrangement, only it
was just a bit riskier!"-~
(mid-sixties).

On closing of the college:

”Most of the radical agita-
tors graduated last springand
this should help . . . Luckily,
reason and rationality pre-
vailed over emotion . . . Yet,
we must remember that the
administration and faculty did
not capitulate to the students.
It was the other way around
. --(twenties).

0n meals:

“We had our meals in the
Quadrangle u and delicious
meals they were." -- (pre-
twenties).

" . . . there is a sit-down

at 6:15; so you can haveitwith

Dr. Gregory Falls, executive director of the University of Washington's School of
Drama, who was invited to Grinnell to serve asa scholar—consultant for the theater
program, talks with students interested in drama during a speciallyrarranged lunch
in one of the Forum's private dining rooms. The lunch was sponsored bv Steve Grow’s
campus speaker's committee.

Dr. Falls, Dramatisl, Praises
Grinnell’s Theater Department

by Greg Butcher

”Today many people are exV
ploring nonrverbal, non»logi-
cal, nonrlinea!‘ experiences,
meanings, values; as a result,
we're seeing a quickening inn
terest in the arts."

Dr. Gregory Falls,executive
director of the University of
Washington School of Drama,
was invited to visit the cam-
pus for a weekend as a sch-
olarr consultant by President
Glenn Leggett and James Re-
eder, chairman of the theater
department, to assess Grinn-
ell’s program and to suggest
the direction and scope of its
future.

”Grinnell provides a mar-
velous potential situation for
teaching and studying theater.
I was impressed with the in-
terest and intelligence of ma-
jors. The college has made a
serious commitment in faci-
lities and space.

"The backbone of the drama
department is its production
program," Dr. Falls con*

Unstructured Free University
Offers Students Alternatives

There seems to be a lot of

question on campus as to ex»
actly what Free University is
and what it is trying to prove.
This reporter would like to
clarify the activity andpur-
pose of Free University on
the Grinnell campus.

Free University is an unofr
ficial, very loosely structured
program oflearningopportunr
ity. Dave Hechler organized
the original meetings, but he
stressed that he spoke as a
participant and not asa leader
since every student interested
has a say in the program.The
Free University attempts to
encourage students to pursue
knowledge on their own, Wilh’
out aprofessor breathingdown
their necks or influencing
their choice of subjects. As
Dave said, "Students are be
coming more and more ser-
vile in our educational sys
tem," and the Free Univer-
sity offers a chance for stu-

dents to participate in their
own education. in this prog-
ram students are able to teach
and learn from other students.
"There are a lot of people
here who have things to offer,
and it's a shame they‘re not
using them," according to Jim
Hartog, who teaches a con-
temporary jazz class for the
Free University. Free Uni-
versity also gives students
and professors an opportunity
to share thoughts and know
ledge with each other on an
equal basis.

The reaction to the classes
by those students participat-
ing has been fairly enthusiar
stic, but Jim fears that not
as many people have partici-
pated as are interested due
to Students associating the
Free University with a so
called ”long-haired, farrout
fringe,” Both Dave and Jim

would support the idea ofpro-
viding credit for production.
Participating in aplayismore
worthwhile than any term pap—
er on a play could possibly
be."

“The mix of courses in the
department inevitably must
reflect the strengths of the
faculty and the interests ofthe
students. The facultyaretalkr
ing vigorously with each other
and with students;and theyare
arriving at some answers."

“There isa certainminimum

essence of a theater major;
but when you try to define it,
there is a constant struggle.
Whatever they decide nowwill

from now. last year's notes
that worked so well often have
to be thrown out.”

One of the open questions that
Dr. Falls was to answer was
whether the college should
continue to offer a theater
major. He answered in the
affirmative and added, ”lpre-
dict we'll see the number of
majors and participants inc-
rease and as a result there
will be a demand for more

that’s the value about this
type department and this type

Group Stays Summer

With the early closing ofthis
college last May, a critical
view of the contemporaryedu»
cational process was under
taken. One of the results of
this analysis was the forma
tion of the Grinnell Freedom
School this pastsummeri This
school was formed by a small
group of Students concerned
with the goals and the means
of the educational process.
According to one of the parti-
cipants, the purpose of the
school was to study the con-
cepts of radical politics, to
crystalize‘these concepts by
an investigation of materials
of interest to radicals, and
ultimately to develop the abiv
lity to communicate these id-
eas to the populace at large.
Approximately eighteen SIU’
dents participated on a full
time basis with a few faculty
members intermittently being
involved. The basic means of
achieving the specified goals
was through the formation of
a collective. With this slrucr
ture, the group was able to
place a special emphasis on
eliminating the conditioned
behavior instilled into indivi-
duals by contemporary Ame
erican Society. Specifically,
the emphasis was placed on
the position of the woman in

today’s world, and her func-
tion in relation to the collect
tive living situation. Aspecial
women's caucus met to fur'
ther the understandingof “wo-
men's liberation” both in re
lation to collective living and
society in general.The exper~
iences and results of the sch-
ool are currently being pub-
lished in a report which Shall
be distributed to college offi~
cials, students, and undergr-
ound newspapers. Theaccom-
plishments of the group were
summed up as: an increase in
the knowledge of radical polir
ticals, a better developed inn
tellectual concept of thesepo-
litics and the establishment of
a favorable living situation,
utilizing the concepts which
had been studied.

Notice to pre-med students:
The annual pre-medical con-
ference for students and ad-
visors will be at the Univer-
sity of Iowa November 6. The
dayrlong conference includes
discussions, tours and talks
with medical students and fa
culty. All pre-meds, are inn
vited. Sign up for the trip
in either Dr. Oelke’s or Dr.

Dr. Cloh‘elier Publishes Book
Exploring The Nature Of Space

GRINNELL, IA. ,_ Dr. Beryl
E. Clotfelter, professor of
physics at Grinnell College, is
the author of anew book, "Ree
ference Systems and Inertia
" The Nature of Space," just
published by the Iowa State
University Press.

The volume is a study of ex-
perimental results bearing on
the two questions: Does an

absolute space exist7and What
is the origin of inertia?

Prof. Clotfelter discusses
many experimental attempts
to verify the existence of ab
solute space. He points out that
although these attempts have
been uniformly unsuccessful,
the concept itself is important
for an understanding of the
science of mechanics, which
deals with the morion of ob
jects.

An unanswered question in
the study of motion iswhether
a football, for instance, is
really moving when thrown or
whether it only appears to be
moving. In the observer's
view, the football's motion is
noted only in relation to the
status or location of other ob-
jects.

If on the other hand, the foor
ball could be proved to be moe
ving in and of it itself and not
merely in relation to other ob*
jects, this would be "abso»
lute" mutton which would
mean that there is anabsolute
space through which such mo
tion takes place.

The question continues to be
significant because attempts
to build logicaldcscriptions of
mechanics without the use of
the concept of absolute space
have so far been unsatisfac~
tory.

A related question which the
book discusses has to do with
inertia, the property which
muses matter to resist a ch-
ange in its motion. inertia
makes an object hard to start

moving, and makes it try to
continue moving once it is
started. The question is whe—
ther inertia is a builtein pro-
perty of matter or whether it
is a result of interactions of
one piece of matter with the
other matter in the universe.

if, for instance, the total
mass in the universe were
reduced by half, would a foot-
ball be easier to kick than it
is now? Many of the sensitive
experiments carried out in
attempts to resolve the ques-
tion of inertia are described
in the book.

According to the preface, the
book makes available to stun
dents with a minimal backgr-
ound in physics andmathemae
tics an introduction to current
work and modern thinking on
these concepts which are im-
portant to the ultimate ques-
tion of the large-scale struc-
ture of the universe. Thus,the
book alsodiscusses Einstein's
general theory of relativity
and its relation to the con-
cepts of absolute space and
inertia.

A member of the Grinnell
College faculty since 1963,
Prof. Clotfelter is currently
Chairman of the Faculty. His
graduate work was done atthe
Ohio State University and the
University of Oklahoma. He
received his Ph.D. degree at
the latter institution in 1953.

He is a member ofthe Amer-
ican Physical Society and the
American Association for the
Advancement of Science. ‘
