Just Another Senate Meeting
Until Bucks Delivers Speech

By DICK CHADY

The Senate meeting was goingto be
lust another Senate meeting—filled with
the events which alter and illuminate
student politics: confirming nominations
and establishing committees.

The SGA President announced that he
had attended several committee meet-
ings; the AWS Board President said
that hours were being reevaluated,

Men's Couri Fines
To Have More Bile

From now on students who take more
than a week to pay their Men’s Pri-
mary Court fines risk going on conduct
probation, according to Tim Daily,
Chief Magistrate of that court.

Daily said that since November they
hava handed out eight fines and only
two have been paid. “In other words, the
court is being ignored," said Daily.

Week to Pay

Under the old system a student was
given a week to either pay his fine or
appeal it to the high court. If the student
didn't pay, there was no way for the
court to get the money.

Under the new system, after the week
has expired the Court will reconsider

Then the Speaker of the Senate turned
his report (Item F on the agenda) into
an attack on the bureaucratic perspeCe

In a prepared speech, Dan Bucks in-
dicted “leadership groups" for tailing to
“overcome bureaucratic concerns and
inspire imagination and idealism." He
said that it was the task of “those on
the periphery of influence" to “prod the
centers of decision-making into consid-
ering new ideas."

He said that the failures of the hu-
reaucratic perspective are that it over.

too high a premium on consensus, and
breeds a "cult of confidentialism.“

Drug Use on Rise
0n College Campus

By BOB HODIERNE

It you talk to lots of different kinds
of people on campus about marijuana at
Grinnell you become convinced that its
use increased greatly this past fall. But
Gl'innell is not alone in this respect. A!
Federal Narcotics Commissioner Henry
L. Giordano said in testimony to the
House Appropriations Subcommittee in
March, “This drug—taking trend in col-
leges has jumped a great deal in the
last two years. 1’

How widespread the use of marijuana
is on campus is an open question. When
describing other campuses the chief psy-
chiatrist at the University of California
at Berkely said “at any big-city uni-
varsity or sophisticated. small liberal
arts college, ll) per cent of the students
will experiment with LSD or marijuana."

Most students who will venture esti—
mates also indicate that the number of
students who continue to use marijuana
after a few contacts is very small, The
number of one—or two—time users who
try it just to see what it’s like seems to
be fairly substantial

Further, the type of student who tries
It does not seem to be limited. or in
other words, not just the so—called
“beats" have tried marijuana. “Nice"
kids have tried it for the same reason

'Liberal' Politics
Of NSA Cause
Varied Response

By ANN KIRSCHNER

The National Student Association. a
confederation of approximately 325 col-
lege and university student governments,
has been accused over the past few
years of not accurately representing its
members. At the forefront of the critl.
cisrn are the National STDPANSA Com-
mittee and the Young Americans for
Freedom. It has been said that NSA
is staunchly supported by Communist
and other left-wing groups.

Literature concerning the various at.
titudes toward NSA was anonymously
submitted to the SH! this past week.
Included was a pamphlet put out by
the STOP-NSA Committee. which George
Wittgraf, Grinnell’s NSA Coordinator.
says is several years old and‘probably
inaccurate. According to the pamphlet,
"NSA has become increasingly involved
in political activity" so that “its serv-

ices to member schools have becomo'
negligible ” The committee charges that '

NSA has not been satisfactorily fulfill-

Will Issue Statement
To Parents, Students

Grinnell’s administration tomorrow
will issue a three page statement to the
student body about “Student Use of
Drugs."

The statement — to be placed in mail-
boxes and mailed to the parents of stu-
dents tomorrow —- says that the colleg.
"will not adopt the position that ‘it can'(
happen here', but does affirm a high
level of confidence in the mature judg-
ment of its student body when drugs on
rumors of drug use are present, and of-
fers the full extent of its resources in
meeting concerns of students. "

The statement is offered (according to
its introduction) “in response to a recent
warning and appeal by the Food and
Drug Administration of the United State!
Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare, and also in response to current
discussion among students, parents, edlh
cators, and the general public."

The statement — several months in
preparation — was originally to be re-
leased late in May when a book by
Richard Goldstein about drugs on cam-
pus (Hey Mr. tambourine Man: Drug;
on Campus) is scheduled to be releaserL

A recent flood of publicity about drugs .
on other campuses, however, prompted
the administration to release the report
now. Earlier this week an Iowa City
newspaper printed a story about drugs
on the campus there that evidentally
caught the University of Iowa admin-
istration by surprise, president Leggett
indicated that he didn’t want Grinnell to
be put in a position to deal with this issue
after it had been brought up by someonl
else.

The three-page statement is essentl<
ally a statement about the possible of.
fects oi various drugs. It is frank and
clinical.

The statement concludes saying that

To do this we have widened
each column of type by one-

the size of the old columns) and
cut the number from five to

We have also eliminated tho
line between the columns (called
“ntles”) and left I wider sep-
aration of nothing but whit.

We are also varying the sin

Drugs ai Grinnell

7 The use of drugs at Grinnell does not, we believe,
constitute a “problem.” In the fall of this year we
started doing research into the use of drugs, especially
marijuana, on campus Since Christmas time, when
we learned of a book that would come out this spring
mentioning Grinnell and drug usage, we have inter-
viewed over 60 students who purported to know some—
thing about drug usage at Grinnell. Many of these
Said they had tried marijuana. Many said they hadn't
Almost all knew of someone who had. Almost all
agreed that there was no “problem” as such,

1‘ The “problem” will start now with ofﬂcampus
reaction. Some parents will be indignant. Some gifts
,will be withdrawn from the college, This kind of re-
action is inevitable. A major portion of it will prob-
ably be headed off because the administration made
a statement in advance of any sensational break in the
Story,

What we hope happens on campus now is that
marijuana and other available drugs are discussed
openly and objectively. We hope that students will
take the time to study the report issued by the admin-
istration and even better, study still other informa-
tion on the topic

We know that no matter what is said about drugs
'some students are going to try them. We hope that
when they do they will have informed themselves
about the potential dangers.

A New NOUS

Once there was a magazine on campus called
NOUS. It died a quiet death. It was a magazine de-
voted to articles about philosophy and as such had
fairly narrow appeal. ,

Now NOUS may be resurrected, A proposal be-
fore the finance committee of the Senate would a-
bolish Grinnell Review as such and incorporate the
literature traditionally published in the Review with
new publication, a new NOUS.

The proposal has our complete support, We think
it is time that the “third publication” be given a new,
bigger and (pardon the expression) flashier format.
We think it could be a big step in promoting more cre-
ative writing and thinking.

Nexi Week

Next week the SA’LB will print “The Liberal Lib~
eral Arts College and Its Students: Part II, Carleton."
Burdett Loomis, a junior majoring in government at
Carleton, writes the lively discussion of life at that
Northfield school. His comments are interesting as
,well as informative,

I had always been told — and believed —
that you should maintain your sense of hu-
mor. So I was chuckling softly as l lugged
my Air-Foam suit case onto the train behind
me.

"Where're you going?” demanded the con-
ducmr, a sullen type with a white shirt with
a diriy collar.

“The Territories.”

“First car in your right."

“IS there a Club car?”

“Yeah. three cars that way."

I found a seat. I was alone in a double
seat. I sat on the aisle hoping that it would
make it harder for someone else to sit with
me. People Sit down if the aisle seat is vacant
but not many bother to step over you.

The porier in the club car wanted my
ID, i spent an extra dime and had Beet-
eaters instead of Inc American brand may
were serving. I didn't talk to anyone in the
car and after the third one I felt I was seeing
things in perspeciive and felt pretty good
about leavmg.

Lightin’ out as it were.

I stopped to think about how light the suit-
case really was this time. Nu hooks makes
a lot of difference when it comes to the
amount of weight you have to carry around.

“College kid?" It was some traveling
salesman type nexl lo me.

“Yes. Well. yeah, sort bi."

“Vacation time. Going home for vacation,
huh?”

"Well, no, nol exactly" I didn't want to
talk to him,

“Going home for the weekend."

“No, I’m not going home, you see . . I"

Rules Of Disorder

"Oh, I see. Going lo visit your girl some
where. I remember when I was in college —
went to college you know, during the depres-
sion, I knew how much an education would be
worth, helped me get where I am today ~ I
remember going to visit girls at other schools.
Kind of nice, you can sort of have as many
as you want that way. They never {ind out
about one another. Yeah, I remember col-
lege."

"No, I’m leaving school." I bit inlo 1
piece of ice in the helium of my glass.

The salesman leaned forward, grinned I
little and whispered “They kick you out?"

“on no, no, I just left.” l was looking for a
way to get away from this guy, I could just
excuse myself and leave I guess.

“That was a mistake. Real big mistake.
My God son how will you ever make a living
Without a college education? If it wasn't for
my college education I’d be just another
salesman but now I'm sales director in this
whole area. A two state area and every Auto-
strong spring in the district that’s sold I’m re-
sponsible tori I owe what I am to my college
education."

“Listen, I’d better get back to my seat.
I'm pretty tired and ”

“No, listen here a While. Think of the sac-
rifice your parents made to get you into
school and this far, Do they know you’re leav~
Ing?" i didn’t answer. or course they didn't
know. “Hell, if I’d done that my old man
would have heat the living innards nut bl me.”
I started to get up but he grabbed my sleeve.
“What're you going to do wiih yourself now?
They’ll draft you you know."

“I'm going to my seat and sleep."

And I left the club car.

EDI NOTE: The following is a letter sent
lo the Ad Hoc Committee on Hall Reorganiza-
tion,

Your purpose, as we understand ii, is to

Leggelt concerning ihe residence hall su-uc.
ture. We believe, though, that you have been
assigned a task winch, given the present
framework {or discussion, is beyond your

disturbed that in all discussions so far about
the “North Campus Problem," no statement
at the purposes or a hall syslem has been
mentioned. Without such a statement. we {all
to understand how any recommendations
could have beneficial effects except by sheer
lllck.

We assume that the question of hall ievi-
sion arose in response to widespread faculty
and administration opinion that the hall sys-
tem, as constituted, was failing to fulfill the
aims of a Grinnell education We wonder,
though. If your committee DI‘ anyone else has
a clear idea of What those aims are. A series
of highly idealisilc siaiemenis appears on
pages 20-21 of ihe College Bulletin, bui we
wonder If ihey are speciﬁc enough to be reler
Vant, either as ihe Working policy oi the co]-
legc, or as a basis of evaluation for your cam-
mlllee. Do these statements constitute a suf-
Iimently applicable set of expectations to serve
as criteria [or empirical study? It would seem
that problems are measured by the degree bi
divergence between the reality and the idea].
But ii understanding of either is in any de-
gree lacking, IS not any attempt to deﬁne his
problem an exercise in futility? And do ihc
objectives of lhe college, as stated, give that
adequate understanding?

We have made reference to the aims of
Grinnell education, aims which imply that the
scope of your undertaking should not he limit-
ed lo the residence hall system. it is our con-
tenlim‘i that llie residence hall system is not
an einiiy unto itself, but rather that it is an
integral part of the total Grinnell educational
complex, and that it should be treated as silch.
We quote li-om page 21 or the College Bul-
lelin:

Grinnell College exists to achieve these

nine purposes (the nine objectives as
slated on pages 20-21) which relate mast-
Iy to the kind of person the individual is
to become. The courses, examinations,
laboratories, term papers, sports, resi-
dence hall life, student. self-government—
ihe apparatus, in slum _ can be justified
only it they are instrumental toward these
goals,

If Grinnell is to maintain any direction to-
ward educating its students in future years,
it must first make Clear what it means by the
educational process, This facilitates both evalr
uarion of the success of the present program
and projection of luiure programs upon a pr8<
established standard. A definition of [he edu<
caiional process, its end and means, is now
necessary, not only for competent evaluation
of the residence hall system, but also lo
clarify areas of the Grinnell educational coin-
piex that are experiencing the same state of
chaos and confusion oi goals that it is. Educa-
tion needs to be spelled out in terms that will
justify [he disorganization of the lecture pro»
gram, that will dispel present dissatisfaction or

Studies program, ihai will jusiiiy ihe lack bi

education, that will explain the objectives or
die admissions policies, [hat will explain, in
detail, the relationship of the student with his
iaculiy advisor and other facility members,
and that will explain the lack of a vigorous
course evaluation program,

We recognize that n is not your task is set

believe, however, that in the absence of such
a directive, any policy recommendations you
might make would be irrelevant and meaning.

Problem ls Spiri‘i

To the Editor:

To many people, the basic problem at Grin<
hell is not open dorms, BELG, or the hall sys-
tem, but the spirit and atmosphere of the col-
lege me, both academic and social. Vilal to
all colleges in general and the small liberal
arts college in particular is an active (3011‘
cem on the part of the students for what they
are doing and what is happening around
them. A number of other colleges have many
of the same aspects as Grinnell — size, rules,
seclusion —- but have much different atmos-
phere. What these schools have that Grinnell
does not have are student bodies which are
aware. excited, and excitable. It is this lack
of vibrancy and excitement which is basic to
the Grinnell campus problem.

What we need is an airing of emotions and
an intellectual interchange of those topics
which should be important to us — the role
at the student in the community, the active
process of learning, current events, speakers,

concerts, and everything else which we should
be concerned about.

The 5&3 has a direct Iunclion and re-
spons ility in the formation of such a re-
vitalized atmosphere. As the ideal medium—
in terms of format and distribution—the 5853
should carry on discussions arising from col-
luqlliurns. review stimulating events, and pose
discussions 0! the'ideas and questions in-
volved. Discussion is a direct step toward an
environment where there is an excited inter-
change and conﬂict of ideas, and outlooks. The
Shit should ire-evaluate its role in the build-
ing of an active and vibrant Grinnell.

leads in ‘Faniasiicks'
‘Engagingly lnnoceni’

By BRUCE MCCONACHIE

Both Stephanie Lewis and Murry Nelson
were engagingly innocent as the Girl and Boy.
Although Stephanie‘s Voice was weak and
Murry's stage movement awkward, we never
lost interest in their poetic melodrama.

Tom Pope and Milt Tootle, their fathers.
were quite funny. Their lumbering vaude-
ville dance in the “Vegetable Song” is one or
the highpoints of the show.

But the real comics of the show were Max
Heltgott and Keith King, the dying indiun
and the aging actor. A precise sense of timing
made their periormances especially enjoyable.

Ruthie Sternberg, who portrayed the Mute.
was graceful and exact.

when the cast was taking its curtain call.
they turned to applaud Anne Hoganson and
Janet Hamilton ior their accompaniment at
the piano and harpsicord. I thank them too.

In general. the comic parts of the show
were the best, and the romantic scenes, the
weakest. But this last gripe is more an argu-
ment with the script than the production.

The cast may have been uneven in talent,
but all of them shared in the spirit at the
show. We knew they were enjoying it and this
increased our own pleasure. Rick MacDoweit.
the narrator, was outstanding. His is a
physically exhausting role’and i was amazed
that he never seemed out of breath. Rick's
lithe movements, his strong voice and the
Mephistophelean glint in his eyes practically
carried the show.

“The Fantasticks" is unique among an
nell productions in that it was ﬁnanced by
Student Govemment. I am glad that the SGA
leaders have a broad conception of their re-
spunsibiiities and I hope that they will under-
take a similar venture next year.

Among the stands apparently taken
by NSA that the committee opposes are
proposals that the House Un-Amerioan
Activities Committee be abolished, that
birth control information be distributed
to migratory wurkers, that student gov-
ernments be encouraged to organize la<
bar unions among agricultural migra.
tory workers, and that universities deny
recognition to fraternities that locally
or nationally engage in “discriminatory
practices." Recently, NSA scored Presi-
dent Johnson's Viet Nam policy and
called for an immediate halt to the
bombing of North Viet Nam.

Grlnnell and NSA

Wittgrai said that there was consid-
eration here two years ago to withdraw
from NSA, but only on the grounds that
we might not have been getting our
money's worth in student services How-
ever, the Senate defeated the proposal.
Grinnell has chosen to put emphasis on
the individual benefits of NSA, such as
loxv»cost insurance and discounts on tra~
vel in Europe. As to the apparent lack
of concern on this campus about the
liberal NSA policy statements, Wittgraf
pointed out that “most people on camp-
us have no idea what NSA stands for,
or that we are even members"

Wittgrat noted that NSA has a better
representation 0! student government

leaders than at students in general, be-

cause those students most active in gov-
ernment are the most likely to take
ﬁrmer political stands,

and liquor in high schools

One of the apparent frustrations in
dealing with this experimentation on
campus is that it doesn't appear to have
a center. The students get their marl-
juana from a wide variety of sources
making it impossible to “dry up” any
one source and thus solve the problem.
Most find their source in large cities
where it is readily available.

sources as authoritative as possible, rea-
lizing that some study is necessary in

The report goes on to say that Grin»
nell “encourages its students to refrain
from unpl'escrlbed or illegal use of any
narcotic, stimulant, or hallucinogen. and
to avoid contributing to any illusion or

drama, excitement, and/or myth about
drugs . . ."

The college also “intends to regard
any student lound to be contributing to
the problems by usrng drugs illegally or
by contributing to others’ use oi drugs
as having engaged in unacceptable con-
duct and subject to dismissal (depend
ing on the circumstances of the student's
involvement, however, the college may,
at its option, deal with the matter through
counseling and other resources) . . ."

In a letter that goes with a copy of the
statement to parents, President Leggett
says that “our evaluation of the situa-
tion at Grinnell offers no cause for a-
larm.”

Leggett goes on to say that "we have
no evidence of widespread use of drugs
by our students," and that the College
will attempt to stop whatever use of
drugs there may be by trying “to per-
suade students of the dangers to them-
selves and to others when they play a-
round with drugs" instead of by “polic-

Pioneer Nine To Face Monmouth Today Tennis Team loses First Two
Ailer Weekend Losses to Cornell. Knox

By GARY WILSON

Today the Grinnoli baseball team
tries to reactivate their winning ways
as they travel to Monmouth, lllinois, in
their Browmobiie, Gatton Bomb, and
G, W. Mustang to take on a talented
team of Monmouth Scots.

Last Friday the Pioneer diamondmen
steamed up to Mt. Vernon and lost a
nine-inning game to Cornell by the score
or 4-1. The Rams jumped off to an early
lead by scoring two quick ones in the
first inning on a walk, a Stolen base, a
double, and a single.

Grinnell came back in the third with
a run, on a walk to Greg Dean, a wild
pitch, a single by Steve Tilly. and an

Thinclads Place 8th
At Cornell Relays

Grinneii’s thinciads ran into some tough
competition and bad luck at Mt. Vet'-
non’s Cornell Relays last Saturday as
the Pioneers took eighth in a field of
twelve schools. Overcoming strong bids
by SCI and Central, Luther College won
the team trophy, Grinneli’s cause was
hurt by lack at good periormances in
the field events and poor baton passes
in the sprint medley. Captain Jeri Lang-
ham remained the foundation of the
Grinneli team as he led the two-mile
relay team of MacDowell, Kelsey, Brint-
nail, to a third place iinish. Langham
again led the mile relay (Watt, Schwartz,
Brintnall) to a second place iinish. Along
with Jon Busweli’s iiith in long jump,
these relay teams were Grinnell's only
point winners at the day.

Both the varsity and trash teams
move to Cedar Falls and the Dickinson
Relays this weekend where, though the
competition will be at least as strong,
they hope to improve their showing.

error by the Cornell left fielder. The
score remained 2-1, With both Sides gets
ting men on base but being unable to
score. Then the Rams punched across
a run in both the seventh and eighth
frames, Tilly went the route for the Pio-
neers to even his record at L1 as he
stroked out two hits to lead the Grinneu
batsmen.
Spirits High

The next port at which the Pioneers
docked was Galesburg, Illinois. The
L’mox Siwashers were fresh from a
drubbing by Monmouth. and the Grinnell
players’ spirits were “high,"

The game turned out to be a pitcher‘s
dual between Grinnell’s Dean and
Knox’s Litney. The ﬁrst sixnandra-half
innings were scoreless as neither team
could tally although both had several
chances,

Scores in Seventh

Finally in the bottom of the seventh,
an infield error, a sacrifice bunt, a walk,
and a one-bagger produced a run {or
the Siwash, The Pioneers came right
back in the next frame with a marker
to tie the score. Les Pafi was hit by a
pitched bail and advanced to third on a
double on [he right-center ience by Dean.
Tilly drew a base on balls to load the
bases and another free pass to Bob
Geller brought Patf home for the tally.

The game continued with neither team
being able to score again in regulation
play. At the end of nine innings the
score remained knotted at one apiece.

Grinnell was unable to score in their
half of the first extra inning. In the bot-
tom ot the tenth, Knox started off with
a walk and a stolen base. The next man
sacrificed him to third. Litney scratched
out an infield hit when no one was able
to cover iii-st. At this point Dave Schetz
relieved Dean and threw one pitch, after
which the Siwash scored on a delayed
steal. it was a heartbreaking 2-1 loss.

 

The word is out! Ahrv does it! That’s
right. Ahrv delivers direct to North
Campus rooms. And it gets there hot
and fast, too. Next time — don’t

starve, call Ahrv.

As Carleton, St. Olaf Triumph

The Pioneer tennis team dropped their
first two matches of the year in a double-
duai played here Saturday. The first
one was to powerlul Carleton 9-D while
sr. Olat squeaked by 54 when they took
three doubles matches to overcome a
4-2 singles deficit.

While the Carleton shutout does not
seem very encouraging, it must be re-
membered that last year’s second place
Pioneer team was also shutout against
Carleton in the opening meet of the
year. That one was played at Carleton.

Only twice were the Carls extended
in the opening meet! At number one
singles Mike Greenﬁeld won the first
set only to lose the next two. And at
number three singles, Elija Hicks lost
the first set,‘ won the second one 7.5,
but imally succumbed in the third one
W. In the other seven matches the
Pioneers went down in two sets.

The Pioneers started out well against
St. Olaf when‘Greentield blitzed his op-
ponent 62, 6-1). After Dick Lovell and
Hicks lost at two and three, the Pioneers
ran oit three wins in a row, Jim Greene

In the ﬁrst meet Lee and Risser also

5351' Still Leads
Softball League

As the intramural softball tournament
moves past the halfway point, only
East Norris still has an undeieated reo-

Drd. Three teams now have one loss—
Smith, Dibble, and Clark. Smith and Dib«
ble have already lost to East while
Clark lost to Dibble and was scheduled
to play East this aiternoonr

The biggest game or the year'came

, Tuesday when an overly-conﬁdent crew

from Smith ran into the East Grinder.
While the East tans watched as their

’ boys careiully kept the score down, by

making many errors, so as not to make a
rout of the game. the Smith ians glumiy
sat on the sideline and watched their buys
slowly fall from the ranks Hi the un-
deieated.

By their and others' admission, Smith
had a tough team. They had iirebali-
ing Henry wingate on the mound, and
such potent hitters as Jim Randall to
back hiln up. But Wingate could not fire
the ball past the East batters and Ran-
dall only managed one hit.

East got behind in the iirst inning
4-1, but the East fans were not Worried
because East had been behind early in
tour oi its tirst iive games.

in the second inning East started roll-
ing. Normally a singles hitter, Coach Jim
Wilson slammed a three-run homer past
the astonished iett fielder to tie the
score. Later in that inning, East took
the lead they never gave up. With
Steve Casey spearheading the attack
with three hits, and left-handed hurier
Greg Rankin mowing down the Smith bat-
ters, East took a 14-7 lead into the bot<
tom of the seventh. After Rankin be-
came a little wild on the mound and
East made a couple of errors, Ken
Sturbler, ace relieier on the East staff,
came in to preserve the 14—11 victory.

Smith then dropped to a three-way tie
{or second With powerful Dibble and
Clark. Dibble, since their opening loss
to East, has looked like the toughest
oi the three. Among their wins is a
17-2 shellacking of Clark. Clark's four
wins have come against second division
opponents so it is tough to evaluate
their potential.
