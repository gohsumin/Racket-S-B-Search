Radio Editorial Causes Controversy

On Tuesday, February 11 over KDIC
radio, Neil Fischer and Greg Schmidt
gresenied one of their iii-weekly news

ommentaries, in which they comment
on various news events in a creative
Way.

Although humorous in intent, the show
was potentially libelous to Henry Wil-
helm whose role in the demonstration
against Playboy magazine was an
olyzed.

According to Greg Schmidt, this par
ticular show “was intended to be a hu-
morous commentary on the exploitation
oi protest resulting from the protest on
the exploitation of sexuality."

Upon hearing the editorial by Fischer
and Schmidt, Mrs. Prescott, director 0!
the iniormation service, requested a
eopy of the full text, on Thursday, she
sent the commentary, as “a point of in-
formation only” it) the AP and UPI wire
services, KGRN radio, the Des Moines
Register, the Herald Register, and the
Scarlet and Black, Mrs. Prescott stated
that the editorial was a “potential tare

at for outside news.” Thereiore she
elt, it was desirable that the complete
document be made available in order
to be “protective of everybody con-
¢emed." She was afraid that an inex-
perienced reporter would take isolated
quotes out of their proper context. On
Thursday, A? wire service contacted
Henry Wilhelm, who had not heard the
broadcast but read it in the copy sent

y Mrs. Prescott to the S and B office.

ilhelm denied charges that he had
organized the protest against Playboy
magazine.

that he was aware the protest was going

ty' to Indecent Exposure

20 Subpoenaed, ll Testify at Hearing;
Case to Go to District Court or Grand Jury

By MICHAEL BRANDON

Pleas of not guilty were entered in the
Court of the Justice at the Peace yester<
day for five GrinnBii students who face
charges of indecent exposure stemming
from the February 5 nude demonstra-
tion against Playboy magazine. The
pleas were entered for the defendants
by Des Moines attorney Lawrence Le
Tourneau at a preliminary hearing which
was held in the Grinnell Police and
Fire Department building betele Justice
of the Peace Edwin Lincoln.

The students being prosecuted by
Poweshiek County Attorney Michael
Enich are Catherine R. Leder, of Allen
Park, Mich; Mary Malmlrn of Oklaho-
ma Oil Fredricka A. Nelson, of Brook-
lyn, 1a., James D. Rudolf, oi Elmhurst,
lllinois; and Freda s. Tepier, of Brook-
lyn, N.Y. All at the students are seniors
except Miss Tepier, who is a freshman.

At the outset of the hearing the de-
fense waived its right to a preliminary
hearing, thereby postponing testimony
by the detendants until the case is
tried, The case will now go before the
Poweshiek County District Court in
Montezuma. No date has been set for
the trial.

County Attorney Enich called a total

Playboy Called ”Printed Aphrodisiac“

011 October 5, 1966 after attending his
first meeting of the ADM as president of
Grinneil, Leggett made the following
statement in reaction to a speech given
at the meeting:

"I can agree that it might be lnterest~
ing to bring Playboy into the classroom
as a sociological document; maybe it is
part of the liberal education of our slur
dents. But somewhere toward the end
of the class hour we ought to have ar-
rived at the point of saying that Playboy
is essentially a printed aphrodisiac for
dirty old men and [or sleepless young

men who will grow into dirty old men
it they continue to think that women are
so simple and sex so free and clear."
“All this may seem far removed from
student value systems and student un-
rest but my point is that I think our job
in undergraduate liberal arts colleges is
to create an environment that will per-
mit the development oi effective and re-
sponsible value systems in our students,
and that this belief ought to be the con-
ditioning agent in out attitudes toward
our various constituencies, oi which
students, or course, an the chiei."

of eleven witnesses to testiiy at the
ﬁve hour hearing. Under Iowa law the
prosecution may elect to call witnesses
to testify despite a defense waiver of
the right to a preliminary hearing, Sub.
poenas issued by Justice of the Peace
Lincoln were served on a total of twenty
people at the request of the prosecution.
Several of the subpoenas were Issued
only hours before the witnesses were
ordered to appear.

an employee oi United Press Interna-
tional in Des Moines, emerged from the
court room after twenty minutes of
testfying and remarked, “What a farce!"
Grinnell Police Chief Bill Peters and
Grinnell detective Larry Ray were the
first two witnesses called by Enich.
Photographers Henry Wilhelm and Krys-
tyna Neuman were also called to testify
before a noon recess. Grinnell students
called to testify were S.G.A. President
Tom Thomas, 5&1! Editor Susan Kaeser,
and Jim Lew.

Shortly after Chief Peters, the first
witness, began his testimony, the coun-
sel [or the defense made a motion that
the courtroom be cleared 01 all specta.
tors and newsmen. Justice of the Peace
Lincoln granted the motion and newsmen
were barred from the courtroom tor the
remainder of the proceedings.

The five defendants have retained
Des Mollles attorney Dan Johnston as
their counsel, but Le Tourneau, his part-
ner, handled the defense yesterday be<
cause Johnston had a speaking engage<
ment in another state. Johnston is the
Democrat who was defeated by Attorney
General Richard Turner in the last 9130‘
tion.

Asked whether he had produced
enough evidence during the hearing to
insure a conviction, County Attorney
Enich said, “You always hope you have
but you never know." Enich was aid
in yesterday's prosecution by Assistant
Attorney General Douglas Carlson and
Robert Alvine of the Attorney General'l
ofiice,

At the close of the hearing the statd
rested its case and a routine motion by
detense that charges be dropped will
denied. After the hearing Le Tourneau
commented that the purpose of pro<
ceeding with the hearing despite the de-
tense waiver was to provide the prose:

Notes from the Crinnell Police and Fire Station

The fire trucks, cards, cribbage set, easy chairs, and color
TV in the garage at the fire station were all very much enjoyed
by those waiting to appear in court (held in the Recreation Room)
:lor the preliminary hearing for those involved in the disrobing
incident. The perfect cribbage band hanging on the wall next to
the TV was especially interesting to Dean Low and the other
guests The museum-piece fire equipment was also interesting.
Our thanks to Police Chief Peters and the Fire Department for

their hospitality.

This playful environment helped relax the tension created
by the entrance of the outside world, in the form of the Attorney
General’s men, into our peaceful Grinnell existence. For the
ﬁrst time since the Gates event the absurdity of the investigation
could not be ignored or missed by anyone, The big moment the
investigation had been working for, the newspapers have head-
lined, TV has filmed, and students have become paranoid about,
ﬁnally arrived in all its ridiculous glory.

It is more apparent than ever that politicians and the press,
those groups so concerned with the protest, are themselves moti-
vated by a Playboy sort of commercialism. Unfortunately, a dem-
onstration against this group is a bit difficult at this point.

Now, I am not one to defend the slate

Playboy protest races toward a final des-

ls probably in exactly the wrong desired

Now, anyone that saw the ten-man
Louie-Louie brass band last weekend,
which was the funniest thing i’ve seen
for a long time, wonders at the con~
trolled obscenity that passed for a band
and the gentle mob that passed ior
dancers. The last time I saw my body
was in the shower this morning, and as
I looked at it I thought of ten people
singing “You’ve Got to Walk Thai Lone
some Valley." The connection here be-
ing that if you missed the point in what
these people were trying to say then
you rank with the attorney general’s of—
fice, the Maryana (?) Trench, trench

wrote that mother-where-are-you letter

at least, they've pushed through my ivy,

lElTERS

College Exists for Students

Tome Editor:

The occurrences of the last few weeks
on this campus and elsewhere lead me
to make the following comments. (1) A
college exists for the sake of the students,
but students don’t exist for the sake of
the college. It seems, therefore. that the
college must take a greater responsibili-
ly ’or its student-oriented actions than a
group of students should for their college-
oriented actions.

(2) it appears that those who condemn
my action on the pan of the student
body which mighr bring adverse publicity
to the college are in reality asking for a
completely straight campus, and per-
haps one without any students. For we
all know that the student is generally
held in very low esteem by society and
my action, statement, or appearance of
a student or student group which is even
rlighny at odds with what our society
presently demands can only bring nd—
verse publicity to the college of attend-
nice.

(3) Any college which fears for its life
because of a bit of adverse publicity
would perhaps in reality fear for its lite
because of its own inability to survive.
This might imply that such a college is it-
relevant to its students and that it has
nothing bi value that should even man<
date its survival.

(4) Any individual or institution that
reasons that every action and statement
must be carefully thought out as lo all
its possible and profitable implications
and consequences before implementing
that statement or action must be male
gated to its own particular hell of inac-
lion.

(5) I would indicate to the student body
that experience now tells us that the
single voice, or even the dozen voices,
really never has much of an eflect on
the institutionalized establishment. It is
becoming more and more obvious that
there is strength only in numbers. I
would therefore counsel you (in the
plural) that the ultimate goals of your
education must be established by you
and it must be done in mass. It is about
time that you all tell us what is relo-
vanl to you and what direction you want
your educational experience as take. 0r,
must orinncll College really fear that
adverse publicity?

(6) Since we have now rached the
point in the evolution of our society at
which dialogues between the establish-
ment and anti-establishment factions are
not only unsuccessful but also dis-
couraged, I now see the rationale for
mass action. it appears, in this con-
text, that America and most specially
American colleges are reentering a
period or the dark ages, exemplified by
its witch-hunts, its inability to innovate,
and its lack of desire to either change.

Peaceful Revolution

To the Editor:

A sizeable part of the radical move-
merit seems to include a polidcal view-
point of change; power, control, and gov-
emmental systems 0! economics in gen-
eral are common targets of attack. The
Establishment is the object 0! almost
categorically negative comments directed
by the radicals at Grinnell and chewhere.
Agreed, we need some change (revolu-
tion?) and political action. But there are
a. few areas that could be expanded and
more or less opened up in term. of view-
points,

First oi all, the curegnn'czl Ippmachll
“The system is all wrong." This kind at
generalization is nearly as ever—stated
as saying everything is all right. When
you get down to actual mechanisms, any .
system, old or new, is going is have a
few problems which have to be worked
on —~ and after a new order is estab-
lished it ceases very quickly to be new
and comes under attack like its prede-
cessorl If it dictates ideas similar in
categorical content even though different
in actual policy, the new establishment,
too, is faulty.

Obviously, some systems are a lot bet-
ter for certain people than others, but
the universal perfection hr lau of it is
at least doubllul. The pmblem Iith yes-
no categories is that neither one leaves
much choice to individuals When this
happens to anybody’s system. mple's
rights to decide what they want to do are
being stepped on. A freedom movement
should be just that, not another categori-
cal set of rules replacing the old ones

Not everybody potentially interested in
change is politically oriented. u is possi-
ble to be not nearly as worried about the
structure of a government wiui its size
and impersonality as you are with the
structure of your own 'world‘ and the
way you find it. Artists, poets, or musi-
clans, ior example, all have their own
ways of seeing things and communicating

Letter to the Editor:

It has been my policy, during
my tour years at Grinnell, to
air my grievances privately to
a small, but diminishing, group
or friends Having, however. ac-
quired the exalted rank of sen-
lot, I would like to take it upon
myself to comment upon the
quality. or lack of the same, at
writing and editing in the 5&3.

There are some publications
in which the style or writing
and content of the articles are
of such calibre that one is
tempted to overlook occasional
technical errors in the presen-
tation. This, alas, is not the
case with our student news
paper. While I realize that the
paper is put out by people who
are not necessarily accorm
plished editors or journalists,
this cannot overshadow the fact
that the paper, with last week‘s
edition serving as a prime ex—
ample, was incredibly poor in
its technica: aspects. While I do
not protess to be a protcssional
proofreader, I counted 14 errors
of a purely technical nature.
included among these was the
misspelling of 9 words.

Some of the other, more
notable, errors included two in-
coherent seniem‘es and one that
was totally insipid. In the form-
er category was that classic,

that a lot oi people are saying

was the most meaningful dem-
onstration as directed against
Brice Draper, representative or
Playboy, was tairly inellecu
tive." In the latter section came
the statement that President
Loggett would select a dean
from either inside or outside the

lest l be accused oi nllpicking,
allow me to go on to examine
the content of the articles and
their point at View for, it seems
to me, a questioning oi this is
long overdue.

In the article “Implications
of Demonstration," it was noted
that members of the Woman’s
Liberation Movement and tho
Guerilla Theater met to decide
on action to be taken to show
opposition to the Playboy value
system, David Bryan supported
the protest and the form that it
took. Apparently not considered
by either the formulators of the
protest or the author of the arti<
cle was the rather old~lashioned
play or discussing opposing
Viewpoins in order to allow
those listening to make indivi-
dual value judgments. 1, my-
self, do not agree with many
aspects oi the Playboy ethic
but it I were unable to attack
its fallacies fully clothed, I
would consider my protest to be,
indeed, feeble

I would also like to comment
on the growing use of the pro-
noun “we" when the singular
"I" would seem to be mom
correct, Included here are
David Bryan, , . we thank
you, people." and David Lind-
hlom, “We suggest that the

inspired, allow me to comment
on the article on the sit»in at
the University or Chicago. I
was especially interested in the
four “non-negotiable” demands
of the students and the tactics
used to obtain their ends. It is,
it seems to me, a fine example
of the iascism oi the New Left.
This theory, that these stu-
dents are not far-removed from
their generation in Berlin in the
1930's, is receiving much at-
tention and consideration (all of
it coming, no doubt, tram the
true Nazi pigs). 1 was also
struck by the name of the or-
ganizing group of this sit-
the ‘Commitiee of 85' I would
suppose they drew their inspira-
tion from that liberal and hu<
manitarian ‘Committee of Pub-
lic Saiety' which so efficiently
ran France alter their revolu<
tion.

There are other areas which
deserve comment but which a
lack of time and space force
me to pass by. Nonetheless i
hope that my comments may
provoke some change in the
format at the 5&3.

‘Grl'nnell “Considers" Poverty

By KATHY butt

'A number of knowledgeable sources
believe that Grinnell is taking a step in
a relevant direction this spring. From
April 22-14 there will be a student ini-
tiated and organized poverty symposium,
right here under the spreading labelled
trees.

Dale Stein, head of the symposium
Dom/mittee said that the idea was formed
when there was a lot of talk about open
dorms and a lack of meaningful intel-
lectual activity. ”No students from each
social science division are in the Commit-
tee Last semester thEy met once or
twice every week.

One of the main determinations of the
group was that this project would be
controlled completely by the students.
Mr. Milner and Mr. Schwartz have been
advising the group, but the students
have made all final decisions. The
laculty and administration have been en-
touragingly enthusiastic but have not
been directly involved.

The administration has been helpful
in getting iunds tor the program, but the
students have done the actual soliciting.
Most of the money is coming from large
corporations and church organizations;
the college is not pmvrding any. any
speakers have been invited, but there
have been many refusals. Half of the
number desired have agreed to come.

There will be panels on the nature at
poverty, the black sub-culture, the gov-
ernment’s rule, and community organ-
izing, and live lectures. In choosing the
participants the committee tried to com-
bine academicians, communiay organi-
zers, church leaders and antiestab-
lishmentarians. They hope that the
guests can be treated to the traditional
coffee hours, interested student dinners,
and will be able to stay in the dorms.

when asked of what value an intel<
lectual symposium could be in dealing
with the problem of poverty, Mr. Stein
said that, although there is not a lot we
can do at Grinneil, he hopes that this
will motivate individuals to act and will
help to provide the knowledge and under-
standing of the problem that is neces-
sary to attack it. He concedes that the
symposium can not provide the real un-
derstanding needed and that the best
education would be working and living
with poverty. But he feels that because
most students have middle class back-

grounds, ihey cannot envision what pov-
erty means and they must find out be-
fore they can act. Concerning the mid
of a liberal arts education, Dale Stein
commented, “it gets away irom the
practical aspects and deals with the
theoretical. I hope the conference will
help bridge the gap."

Students are needed to help with the
program, moderate panels, and intro-
duce speakers. it this symposium is
“successful” the Rockefeller Foundation
may be willing to fund future ones.

Dixie Harrington, political science pro
fessor, questions the purpose of the con-
ference Although She does not doubt
the motives of the student organizers,
she is afraid that Sterile intellectualizing
will replace action. There is, she feels,
the possibility that people will ieel satis-
iied that they have an understanding of
the pmblem and will not feel the need
to solve it. Miss Harrington wonders
what projects students will be free to
initiate, She believes that this one would
have been begun by the administration
or another department anyway, and,
therelore letting the students do it in
nothing more than a liberal devicer

Neither does Roy Walker, senior, see
what good the program can do. He be-
lieves that ii there is money available
it should be channelled to neighborhood
programs in Des Moirles or Marshall-
town, or used directly in some other way.
“if people here do not understand it
now, discussions or books or lectures on
Grinnell campus will not help. You have
to View it first hand There is the same
hang-up with sex. You don’t need panels
and programs to understand it, but posi-
tive experience." He feels that the ad—
ministration is using the same political
ploy with this “student initiated pro-
gram" as it has used with the black stu-
dents and the student government; pia-
cate the students by making them ieel
like they have a voice and are in direct
control.

Exhibit Panned — ‘Superfitial'

By RICHARD WICHSTROM

The collection of paintings from the
Viviano Gallery, New York. on exhibi-
tion at Schaeffer Gallery from February
12 through March 15 is regrettably a
typical Grinneli exhibition. The Work of
Peter Lanyon, Cesar Manrique, Manabu
Mabe. and Afro is highly superficial.

Peter Lanyon, an English painter, who
died in 1964, is well-known internationally
ior his landscapes of his native country.
From my knowledge of his work, the re
putation is well-deserved. However, the
chaotic and unstructured paintings cur-
rently on exhibition give no indication of
the power and beauty in much of hill
work.

Cesar Manrique, & Spanish painter,
makes extensive use of hot reds and
thickly applied impasto. Although seem-
ingly forceful and dramatic at first, the
paintings are pristine and delicate to
the extreme His elegantly applied im-
pasto is trite.

Manabu Mabe, a young Japanese
painter who had his first one-man show

last year, exhibits interesting washes.
in Breath of Life his wash creates grain
tactile qualities in some areas and 1
others creates very fluid movements!
dissolving line and distinct shapes. This“
technique, however, has the tendenc,
to deaden his color. His oriental heri
tinge manifests itself thmugh deiicat
sweeping line, but his warlt is merely
decorative and superficial.

Afro, a welleknown italian artist, hal

some respects. His work can be chara

relationships. In Quatemo a black Iigur

evolve. Warm blown washes achieve int
teresting tactile qualities and form
beautiful compliment to the iorcefu
blacks. ll Grande Nero explores the fol
range of tonal relationships and posses

ever, the vigorous color in Trofeo seem
forced and unresolved — iull of soun
and fury, signifying nothing.

and to formulate a rough proposal to!
the revision of comps.

At present, the proposal provides foul!
options for the student; he and his ads
visor would decide at the end of hi:
junior year which one would best fit
his needs, They will consider the coursal
he has taken, his future plans, his
strengths and weaknesses, and 1M
possibilities within his field.

The student could choose from the
{our following options:

1) to take the three part oomprehens

sivo as it is presently administeredl

2) to take an independent with or with
out credit, including a paper and do.
fense of it,

3) to take a symposium with or with-
out credit,

4) to make up his own option (either an
innovative plan, or choose not to take
them at all)

in this form, the proposal emphasizes
ﬂexibility, both ior individual studenti
and for the different departments. Thiﬁ
proposal is hopefully the beginning of q
broader inquiry into the usefullness oi
the present system of comps as part of
Grinneil’s commitment to education out:
side, as well as within a student’s mas
jor ﬁeld.

in the hopes of opening up some of
the possibil' ‘es for comps, there will
be a discussion Wednesday, February 2d
at 4:30 in the South lounge. Facult,
members, and all'students in all classej
are invited to participate. A proposal ‘
this sort needs suggestions and oontris
buttons from different segments of the
college.

Know Your Neighbor or "Gidgel Goes Io Monmouth"

by Would-you-believe, Franz Kafka?
GARY GIDDENS

0n the evening at February 14, three
members of the Grinneli student body
embarked on a perilous search for truth,
justice and the American way at Mon
mouth College. The students were mild-
mannerod SGA president Thomas Thom-
as. (it’s a rough task but one that all
honest men should aspire to"), that loves
ly and austere newspaper editor Susan
Kaeser (“Those presses are my life,
by golly, and I‘ll go anywhere for a
good scoopr"). and me, your jolly social
coordinator (“Ba yabada oolla, Ba
yabada oolia coo”).

The trip was motivated by an ACM
oonierence sponsored by Monmouth and
u desire to get the hell out of Grinnell,
sponsored by the Attorney General of
Iowa. Should the meetings be successiul.
we intended to return to Grinnell with
new ideas and broader vistas in the areas
of editing, good writing and dictating.
Should the meetings be a failure. . .weu,
there‘s a great little hamburger stand on
the outskirts of Monmouth.

We arrived at the college (after stop-
ping at the hamburger stand) at about
9:00. Representatives of Monmouth were
to be awaiting us at the student union.
Alter decoding the rather enigmatic di-
Tections given to us by a fat little Mon-
mouthian carrying a bowling ball, we
tound the appointed place. There we
were greeted by reps from Cornell as
well as Monmouth. They eagerly shook
our hands and asked if “they" really
took their clothes off. The three of us
debated brieﬂy as to whether we should
dismbe, light a joint, and copulate —
menage a‘ trois — on the floor. thereby
living up to our reputations, but de-
cided against it on the grounds that it
might alienate them at the meetings.
(Have you readers felt that Grlnnell —
the “Gem of the Cornfield” -—— breeds in-
tolerance?) They decided to postpone the
meeting long enough for us to be housed.
Susan was taken oif to room with the
iemale SGA candidate and Thomas and l
were taken to that old zippo-bang frat
house, TKE. TKE-house is a marvelous
example of where it‘s at in contemporary
America. A brief questioning of the in
habitants brought out the (act that they
could have rA—hour opens it they desired

but that they voted against having girls
allowed past first floor because their
rooms are usually dirty and. well, you
know. Each room — all of them quads
which may be another season why girls
can't get up there -— has a zippy title
like The Bowery, The Pub, The Ghetto
and others not so imaginative. Each floor
has a mutual lounge where a set or bar-
bell: is at everyone's disposal. The frat
guys look disarmlngly alike. They have
short blond hair, pepsodent teeth, wear
gray V-neck sweaters with T-shirts and
tennis sneakers and speak a highly eso-
teric jargon: "Gosh," “Golly,” “Gee,"
“Darn," “Heck," and “Hi0." l was to
iind out what the latter term meant at
a party latter that night.

Back at the union we discovered that
students from Ripon had joined us and
that Knox would be represented Satur-
day. We were invited to sit around a
much too large table on which pads and
water pitchers were distributed. l have-
n’t had enough time to sort out my im-
pressions of that meeting, but the water
was very good. After the meeting we
were invited to the off campus residence
of a student, There, we were scheduled
to “party." Each of the colleges segre-
gated themselves into a comer oi the
room and began to drink. The room was
conspicuously decorated with an elab<
orate stereo system with (our records
and a two loot hooka placed on the col-
fee table lor show and use as an ashtray.
Unlike Susan and Thomas, this reporter
can proudly say that he made a sincere
and dutiful attempt to get in to the ieel
or things for a deeper understanding at
his hostsx l bravely consumed a bottle
of Wine.

The next morning we ate breakfast at
10:00 (not all SAGA systems are run
like Grinnell’s), and went to a meeting
at the union. I don't know What the
presidents or the editors discussed. but
the coordinators found little to agree on
in terms of block booking. Monmouth’s
major concerts were The Brothers Four,
Ferranti and Teicher, and Peaches and
Herb. ’l‘he “Ides at March” made the
front page of the Ripon newspaper
when they appeared there and one line
from that article read. "Anyone who
misbehaves. will be asked to leave the
dance, and lined ten dollars.” Among
the other interesting bits of information
revealed were the facts that Monmouth-
ians have a tendency to be chubby, girls

mouth does not: have a drug "problem."
Everybody’s too busy drinking.

We then paused for lunch and the
food was good, SAGA Chuck would be
awed at how good the loud was.

We all got together for the next and
last meeting in the Alumni room, and
discussed tor two hours when the next
meeting would be held. They insisted on
avoiding speciﬁcs, although they finally
agreed that we should send a notice to
all ACM schools as to whether they
would like to block book Bully St. Marie,
thereby lowering her price. The results
of that are yet to be seen.

Driving hack to Grinneli we had much
to think about. Frat liie for example
was a revelation. You wake up, lift
weights, eat, lift weights, eat, get drunk,
throw up, go to sleep, wake up, lift
weights, etc., etc. We also mourned
over the fact, goshdarnit, that Grinnell
doesn’t have things like winter weekend,
spring Olympics and tall pick-up-sticks.
And how come Only the Scarleteers get
to wear bright red blazers around here?
There was much indeed to ponder as we
drove through the tenebrous portals of
this great institution.

Civil Rights to 1968

SCARLET AND BLACK

The White Students’ Bag

By BRUCE BESSE

Tire civil rights movement on the
Grilinell College campus has iollowed
a pattern which seems comparable to
that of most of the educational insti-
tutions throughout the United States. The
spring of 1964 marked the inauguration
of an organization by the college chap-
lain, Mr. Roger Eldridge, and was sim-
ply referred to as the Civil Rights Group.
its membership consisted primarily or
white students. Gradually, more and
more black students became actively
involved in the various movements on
Campus, and today nearly all, it not all.
of mu black students of Grinnell are
,very much involved with civil rights.

This writer spent a most enjoyable
afternoon sometime ago looking through
back issues of the Sid! in an attempt to
draw out some of the interesting high-
lights and activities involving civil rights
on Campus in the four years preceding
1968, Probably the most important thing
to be noted from this article is the dates
oi a lot or these happenings. This will
tell as much as the accounts themselves.

The Gr-innell Civil Rights Group
'(C.R.G.) was concerned pr arily with
three areas for its activ es. It re-
searched and studied social problems.
planned lectures and discussrons, and
interested students in the Des Moines
slums. This last project was by iar its
most productive. It sponsored numerous
trips to the Des Moines bottoms and
printed several pictures in the 5&1! do»

picting the poverty or Des Molnes. The

group altllloted itseli with SNCC in the
spring or 1965, at which time it also re-
jected the proposal that it join the
NAACP, A major determining factor in
the group's rejection or NAACP aliilia.
tion was lack oi tunds to pay the mem-
bership fee; SNCC membership was tree.

By the time Mr Eldridge had lelt the
College in the summer of 1965, the C.R.G.
had pretty much passed into oblivion.
It had been replaced by the Des Moines-
Preject group. headed by Bonnie Tinker
and Ian Smith. Ian was the iirst black
student to become actively involved in
a Grinnell College civil rights movement
through an administrative position. This
group, as the name implies, carried on
the work in Des Moines which had been
started by the C.R.G, This group like
its forerunner had financial troubles, and
despite much enthusiasm among its
leaders, it tailed to generate much sup—
port from the student body.

By January of 1957 interest in the Des

Moines Project had waned. A 5111le
group or students then became active
in another project in Des Moines — the
Southeast Bottoms Project. However,
this movement on campus drew even
less support from the student body; few-
er than a dozen students gathered in
the South Lounge to hear the head of
this preject explain his group’s goals.

As the white students' interest in civil
rights movements on campus diminished,
more and more black students started
voicing their concerns in December oi
1966, the sun published a letter to the
editor written by Louis Kelley and Roy
Walker, in which they accused the white
liberals on campus ot not being so lib»
eral and tree or prejudice as they
claimed to be. Not only had the con-
cerned white students failed to generate
widespread enthusiasm, but also the in-
tensity of their convictions was now be
ing questioned. This letter served as an
invitation to other black students to
start raking the initiative in the civil
rights movement 0“ campus.

The fall oi 1967 found black students no
longer remaining silent. Stories of ha~
rassment and violence that had gone
untold for years were being exposed ior
the lrrst time by the black population on
campus. The blacks formulated a list of
grievances and presented it to President
Leggett, Dean Thompson and the comr
munlty belora they left for Christmas
vacation. Soon alter the spring semester
started, everyone associated with the
college became aware of a change in the
role Grinnell College was to play in the
area of Civil rights. it was to become
more active than it had ever been, but
it was to achieve this and through the
leadership and initiative of the black
students. The transition can be seen quite
clearly in a statement made by one of
the white leaders of the civil rights
movement on campus. Max Heligott was
quoted in the February 2, 1963 issue oi
the 5&3 as saying, “But it should not
be up to me to take leadership which I
am obviously not in a position to take
up now.” Civil rights had become the
black students bag.

Editors Note:

The 5&8 asked Ernest Weston, pres. of
CBS to provide an article explaining the
Black Student's positan at Grinnell. A
similar article is being written lor the
“Brotherhood" and will not appear in
this paper. An ofﬁcial policy statement
by Mr. Leggett concerning this posltton
will appear in the near luture.

investigation led to Charges

Charges were ﬁled against the deiend«
ants by Poweshiek County Attorney Mic‘
hael Enich earlier this week, following an
investigation by the Iowa Attomcy Gen-
eral's Office, the Poweshiek County Ah
toriley and the Grinnell Police Depart-
ment, Summonses issued by Justice of
the Peace Edwin Lincoln ordering the
five students to appear at the prelimi-
nary heanng were served on Tuesday by
officers of the Police Department.

Oil Tuesday subpoenas were served on
former Grinnell students Henry Wilhelm
and Krystyna Neuman. presently associ—
ated with the East Street Gallery of
Photography, ordering them to appear at
the hearing to testify. Also subpoenaed
on Tuesday was Dean of Students Alice
low. who was ordered to appear at the
hearing with any pertinent information
she might have as “an official of the
College.” Dean LOW last week relused to
provide state investigators with what she
called “conﬁdential information” unless
she was subpoenaed.

On Wednesday subpoenas were served
on eleven additional Grinnell students. ac-
cording to Justice of the Peace Lincoln.
Most of the students subpoenaed were
present at the dismbing incident.

According to legal advisors consulted
by the 5&3 the purposes or a preliminary
hearing ore to Clarify charges against
the deiendant and to provide the prose-
cution with an opportunity to present sui-
ﬁcient evidence to show that a trial in
warranted. Until sufficient evidence sup-
porting a complaint is provided, a Court
cannot require that the defendant post
bond or be jailed.

Waive oi Hearing Sougth

On Thursday the attorney tor the ac-
cused students decided that the delend<
nuts should waive their rights to a pre—
liminary hearing, in which event the
case would proceed directly to trial. The
defense felt that such a preliminary heap
ing would not be necessary because pro-
secutors probably had sulflcient evidence
to Show Cause [or trial, (although not
enough to Convict), because the hearing
lug might result in adverse publicity re-
garding the defendants, and because a
waiver would provide the delense with
more time to prepare lor crosscxarni—
nation of witnesses. However, under
lowa law, the prosecution may elect to
hold a llearlng ln older to interrogate
persons subpoenaed.

According to County Attorney Enich,
the preliminary hearing is the “first
stage” in prosecution proceedings. The
next stage will be arraignment oi the
defendants in the District Court oi Powe-
shlek County. in Montezuma. The direc-
tion in which the trial will then proceed

will depend upon whether or not the de-
fendants decide to change their plea.
Under lowa law “indecent exposule" is
an “indictable misdemeanor" and the
defendants could have been indicted by
a grand jury who would send the case
to district court. An indictable misde-
meanor carrres a heavier penalty than
a regular misdemeanor, which has a
maximum penlaty or thirty days in jail
or a one hundred dollar ﬁner

Chapter 125.1 of the Town Code says
“It any man or woman . s guilty of
open and gross lewdness, and designedly
makes an open and indecent or obscene
exposure or his or her person, or oi the
person of another, every such person
shall be imprisoned in the county jail not
exceeding six months, or be lined not
exceeding two hundred dollars."

Only Five Charged

The SM! has been unable to determine
why only five of the alleged demonstra-
tors have been charged in the incident.
Early this week Asst, Attorney Larry
Seckington. who has been involved in
the investigation, Said that the Attorney
General’s Office had “positive identifi‘
cation" of nine or the persons involved.
Asst. Attorney General Douglas Carlson,
who was on campus again this week, re-
fused to clearly explain why only live
persons are being prosecuted. “It‘s all
a matter of due process," he said. Carl-
son pointed out that testimony at yester-
day’s hearing is public lecord. and may
be used by investigators in prosecuting
other demonstrators.

Carlson refused to comment on wheth-
er the investigation by the Attorney Gen-
eral’s Office is concerned only with the
dismbing incident. There has been wide
speculation on campus and in the press
that Pterodactyi, the campus under-
ground paper, is also being investigated.
The 5&3 has learned that investigators
from the Bureau of Criminal Investiga-
tion have been making inquiries about
Ptero at a printing shop where the paper
was printed last year. investigators on
campus have been observed reading back
issues of the paper, and have reportedly
questioned students about the publica-
tion. Carlson remarked that the state inr
vesuguiors “might be around (Grinnell)
for awhile.”

Charges Attomey’s Duty

Earlier this week there had been con-
troversy about who would file charges
against the alleged demonstrators. The
County Attorney and the Attorney Gen-
eral have concurrent jurisdiction in the
matter. According to Carlson, the deci-
sion to have County Attorney Enicll tile
charges was "by mutual request."

Enlcll told the 5&3 he brought charges
because it was his “duty," and because
there had been complaints from town
residents and people throughout the
state.

The Board oi the Iowa Civil Liberties
Union informally decided to withhold its
aid in the case, but leferred the defend—
ants [D Attorney Johnston. Should the
Case reach a higher court, the lCLU
could conceivably reverse its decision
and offer its aid to the students.

Iiagers Seek Victory

The Grinnell Pioneers will be
traveling to Beloit Friday and
then be moving on to Coe on
Saturday. They will be attempt-
ing to make up for the two set-
backs they suiiered against Ri<
pan and Lawrence last weekend.
These two losses dropped Grin-
nell’s conference record to Hz.
and left the Scarlet and the
Black two full games behind
ninth place Ripon.

Coach Edd Bowers’ big task is
to revitalize an offense that
could manage only 55 points at
Ripon and 53 points at Law»
rence. Deiensively, the Pioneers
have done much better. They
limited kipon to 68 and Law—
rence to 63.

Bowers is considering some
lineup changes for this week-
end's games and doubts that
the starting unit will he identi-
cal both nights.

"We will be racing two com-
pletely dirierem ball clubs,"
Bowers noted. “Beloit is big and
relatively slow while Coe is
small and last. We may go with
sine at neloit and speed and
quickness at Coe."

Coe shares third place in the
standings with an e5 record.
Beloit is seventh at 57.

Fast Proposed

The student Senate is looking
for ideas for this semester's
SAGA fast. Those who have
ideas should present them at
me Senate meeting this coming
Wednesday. One suggestion has
been to pay lawyer’s tees and
court costs tor the people in the
Playboy demonstration. Costs
have been estimated at about
31200, exclusive of any bail or
lines.

All Educators — No Teachers

By TED GLICK

rho Education Project, while working
to formulate proposals for educational
and curricular change, is providing an
example of a new and forward-looking
class structure (or rather, non-struc-
ture). Instead of the usual class proces
dare ot a teacher assuming a role of
authority, directing questions, and/or
channeling the discussion into areas
which he considers important, our
nlxss is run with no leaders and with no
set pattern.

The class sets hours to begin but sets
no hours to end. We end when we have
nothing else to discuss — no bells and
no decisions to break up made by the
teacher bother us (we have no teacher;
Mr. Liggett, the faculty member lne
valved, is just another human being ins

volved in the process at group education
and. enlightenment who contributes ac<
cording to his ability and volition). We
have a goal in mind. i.e,, writing up pm¢
posals for change, but we move towards
these goals as the group wishes to, not
with a well-defined and structured plan
and with the necessary research and
work being carried out as each individ~
ual or small group of individuals seal
ilt; we have no assignments, papers, or
textbooks.

The thing which will be hard for many
people to understand is the fact that we
really are learning, moving somewhere,
and participating in a common educa-
tional experience. We are learning not
just of books and of how to write up
proposals, but also or people and their
lives and their feelings. It is this, this
knowledge oi what a life really is, not
just what a mind says, which is one of
the most beautiiul consequences of this
class.

Faculty Approves Greater Student Voice

By JANET SMITH

The iaculty made several decisions
of significant Interest to the student
body at their meeting Monday night.
The cut penalty for missed classes on
days surrounding holidays was abolished.
No student now attending Grinnell is re-
quired to accumulate more than the
standard 124 credits required for gradua
ation. it was implied by the faculty's
statement that this decision is to be e!»
iective retroactively.

of tar more importance are the
changes made concerning student re<
presentation on the Committee on Ad<
missions and Student Aid and the Educa‘
tlonal Policy Committees (EPC). Last
week a letter distributed by Tom Thom-
as, SGA president, urged students to in-
dicate to the iaculty the need ior stu~
dent participation on the admissions
committee. Mr, Waldo Walker, chairman
of this committee, informed the student
body in a campus memorandum that he
was aware oi student interest. He stated
that the Committee on Faculty Organize:
tion was preparing a proposal to to-
structure tho committee in question. in-
cluding provisions for student involve-
ment. Thomas commented that he ielt
the resultant student-iaculty descussion
was beneficial, as "such communication
—- oi desires. interests, and proposals —
is the tirst important step towards my
tual student participation in the tin-going
process of governing the College,"

The iaculty also passed a recommenda-
tion reorganizing the original Committee
on Admissions and Student Aid. A com-
mittee by that name will no longer deal
with administrative matters, but will be
responsible ior making recommendations
to the President and iaculty on admis-
sion and student aid policy. This cone
mitteo would receive regular reports
irom the Director oi Admission and Stu‘
dent Aid ooncerning the current FNCG‘
dures. Membership on this committee
will include the Dean oi the College,
Chairman oi the iaculty. three elected
faculty members, three students seleot<
ed by the Student Government Associa-
tion, the Director of Admissions, and the
Director oi Student Aid. The fact that
the SGA is to appoint the students gives
new importance to student government
in the opinion of one iaculty member.

ADDRESS HEI'iii

An Admissions Board consisting o1
three faculty members and the chem
tor ot Admissions was formed to deal
with administrative matters. They will
decide on all special cases in admis‘
siooa and student aid which fall outside
the guidelines at official policy. They
would also make suggestions tor the for.
mutations of policy, help in the adminin
stretlon ot policies, and report the num-
ber oi cases they act upon to the Com-
ynitteo on Admission and Student Aid.
This restructure eliminates the necessity
of students using confidential files, which
has been a major objection to student

arilcipatlon in the past. This proposal
tr not yet ofilclal. it was voted upon as
a recommendation to the President:A
which he is to transmit to the trustees.

Each divisional EPC will now have two
voting student members, as the result ct
still another iaculty decision. Each dlvl~
sion will decide its own methods 0!
selection. Trwo probabilities are an elec-
tion of the majors at a division and the
selection of two students from a student
arc which may be created.

Students are now represented on every
iaculty committee relevant to student
interest except the committee on acor-
demio standing. One pmtessar comment-
ed. “students now have a real opportun-
ity to express their voice in campus at:
fairs and policies.‘|
