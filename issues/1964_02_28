classes, live in residence halls
and participate in extracurri-
cular student activities during
their. stay.

“The governors will make no
formal remarks during their
stay,” said Gilmour. “We feel
that the extensive student con-
tacts constitute the real work
of (he politicianeineresidence
program, with more lasting ef-
fect than a mere formal ad-
dress."

Both governors will attend
the seminar in American Stud-
les (Urbanism) and the Politi-
cal Process class. Hughes will
attend a European History lec-
ture; and Morrison, a class on
Race Relations. The wives,

 

 

meanwhile, will attend fine arts
classes.

While on campus Hughes will
stay in Langan Hall, Morrison
in West Norris Hall, Mrs.
Hughes in Haines Hall,.and
Mrs. Morrison in Main Hall. In
special ceremonies Thursday
night, they will be made honor-
ary members of these halls.

Other activities during the

at which interested, stu-
dents will have an oppor-

will be led by Anne Fetter,
John Bowen, and the Bear

eiety.

The group plans to oper-
ate on both a national and
local level. On a national
basis, the group will be a

However, membership in
the civil rights group need
not necessarily include
membership in the NAACP.

‘A Psychological Study of Two Thiigs'
Provides Project for Hicks, Brooks

“Through inane conversation
the play exposes the basic
fears of the characters," stated
Bill Hicks. director of “The
Dumb Waiter,” to be presented
by Hicks and co-actor Steve
Brooks as an independent
theater project on March 1 and
2 in Roberts Theater at 8 pm.

Although neither Hicks or
Brooks is majoring’ in the the-
ater, they classify themselves
as “extracurricular drama mu-
jors.” Both have acted in prew
ious Grinnell performances.

A psychological study or two
thugs in the ‘basement of a
warehouse waiting for their
kill. the play projects the pria
vate, terrors and personal
farces of daily life. “If you
question life, life does away
widi you,” stated director
Hicks. “This is the theme of
the play.

Asked why he picked this
particular work. Hicks said,
"I did it last year‘in Acting
and Directing. The play is in-

l

 

tense for its length. It's differ-
ent because you never know
what’s going on until it's over."

Hicks, who is also designing
the scenery, described the set.
“Previously the play has been
done with a realistic back-
ground, but we’re trying a dii'e
ierent approach. Instead of du—
plicating a room, just the sug-
gestion or a room will be given.
This is the idea of a fragment
ed set."

“One of the main problems,"
according to the pair, ”is time
ing. We have been practicing
since the middle of November
and the play can very easily
get stale. We have to time our»
selves so we will reach the
peak of our performance on
opening night,"

When asked about plans for
ru t u r a dramatic activities,
Hicks stated, ”I would like to
get people interested in a com-
edy but this current project is
enough to keep me busy for
a while."

 

Phil Johnson, a junior polit-
ical science major from Dav.
enport, Iowa, was elected
president of the Student Gov-
ernment Association in‘ n
campus wide election Mon-
day. With 73% or the students
voting, Johnson received a
total of 495 votes.

Concerning Senate ‘Change . . .

One of the basic policies endorsed by the newly-elected
SGA president is.that of structural change within the Senate.
The idea of electing part of the Senate body from student
elections at large is directed at getting more interested and
competent people in Senate seats.

There has been increased dissatisfaction among student
leaders this year concerning the apathy of many senators.
The present speaker has laid most of the blame at the door
of south campus. In the 5&3 last fall he stated that the women
senators were uninformed, inactive, and too severely restrict-
ed by their halls. ‘

If the focus of senate problems is on south campus, we
would suggest that reform he done iii this area rather than
on a campus wide basis. The problem should be attacked di-
rectly rather than by an indirect route which would only

a-create more problems.

Dividing the senate into two factions consisting of hall
representation, as it is now, and of a group elected at large
would only tend to decentralize the method and purpose
of the senate action. Likewise, electing senators at large on
a campus wide basis would create a group of junio ' presidents
of SGA if campaign methods remain as they have in the past.

Tile maiii concern is with the women senators. This is
the problem that should be solved.

The lnaiii weakness in the south campus senate system

is the conditions under which the senators are chosen. House
council elections are held at the beginning of each‘year.
The women change their residences every year, so that the
-indiVidual communities electing their representative have
a constant population flux. At the beginning of the year,
many of the people don’t know each other’s names, let alone
their interests and abilities Senate elections often result in
popularity contests or simple elimination events. A girl really
Interested in senate work might be defeated because she has
no backing, while a less competent member is elected because
the group is generally aware that she has served as senator
before.
' We would propose that women senators should be
elected in the spring, when hallmates are aware of their in-
terests and abilities. While campaigns and voting should be
limited to individual halls, the representation would be shift~
ed around after room drawings. In a sense, the south campus
senate representation would be elected at home, but would be
lervmg at large.

Freshmen senators remain a problem because they must
represent their halls, but the circumstances surrounding their
election are completely inadequate. If the dorms are inte-
grated, however, there would be no longer a need for fresh-

en women to serve as senators, for each hall would still
have the chance for representation.

It would seem that representing each individual hall on
south campus is not nearly as important, under the shifting
living conditions, as adequate and competent representation
of the women students as a whole. Therefore, we see an im-

mediate need for revising the manner in which women sena-

tors are chosen.

Letters to the Editor
Students Want To Know What The Grinnell Image Is

To the Editor:

Question: Is the Grinnell
education considered excep-
tional by graduate and other
undergraduate institutions?
This ”question was assaulted

in a discussion we had with an
interested and informed facul-
ty»administration member, to
whom we are grateful for his
sincerity and help. We feel,
however, that some questions
remain that must be answered
if Grinnell College is to be hon-
est with itself and with the for-
times of its student members.
These questions relate to the
student’s image of Grinnell as
perpetuated by the administra-
tion and perpetuated by him-
self.

”As a private college of
high standing Grinnell. . .3’

“As a high-quality college
it (Grinnell) has distinctive
characteristics which are
especially conducive to the
education of gifted young
people.” .

“Selection makes possible
high academic standards and
keen academic competition,"
(From College Bulletin l963~
1964)

This is the college we think
we are attending. Is this the
college the graduate schools
think we are attending?

 

How high is Grinnell ranked
and by whom?

What is the significance and
eifect of this rank?

Are the demands of Grinnell
more rigorous than, for exam»
ple,’those of Coe, Riporl, Cor-
nell, Beloit, I. S. ll, S. U. 1.?

Would Grinnell students get
better grades at other schools?

How do Grinnell graduates
fare in competition for gradu-
ate admission with students
from the above schools: Does
a 2.8 from Grinnell allow you
actively to compete with 3 M]
from “lower ranked" schools?

Are the grades given at Grin-
nell commensurate with an ed-
ucational program "designed
especially for students of sur
perior ability and talent?"

How do Grinnell graduates
perform in graduate school
compared with graduates from
other schools?

How does Grinnell measure
these various ratings, quantita-
tively?

Finally, how can Grinnell stu-
dents, faculty, and administrar
tion work together to raise the
rank and reputation of their col-
lege?

We would suggest that a
place to begin would be with
quantitative answers to the
above questions. We believe

Miscellany and Digression

Those people who showed an
interest in the column which
dealt with the interim session
may also be interested to learn
that others Who are in no way
connected with the College have
shown an interest in that col-
umn. In a sense, one might say
that. the preceding sentence was
an interesting sentence.

To get back to the subject,
which by the way is non-exist<
ent this week, Hollywood is
bidding for the’rights to that
column. The word is that they
want to turn it into a musical-
comedy western medical spec-
tacular.

Their latest telegram deals
Wim their efforts to line up "a
cast of thousands for the big-
gest extravaganza since The
Great Train Robbery.” They
are communicating with Sena-
tor Barry Goldwater to play the
part of Josiah Bushnell Grina
nell. There is no final decision
yet since Goldwater's latest
message has not arrived due to
adverse weather conditions
which have delayed his pony
express rider.

Tuesday Weld, in what would
be by far her most challenging
role to date, is scheduled to
play the New English Diction-
ary of Historical Principles.
Pat Boone and Bert Parks will
play the tyrannical administra-
tion, While Lon Chaney Jr. and
Slim Pickens will play the ID-
phisticated and intellectual
student body. The invisible man
will make a brief appearance
as the head of the administra-
tion.

some liberties with the events
in order to make a good mo-
tion plclut‘gvTa make the story

ready had to invent some in

dent body.

All in all, the movie should
be one of the surprising rea

liciuls have promised the stu-
dios all the help which the stu-
dios might need. Right now the
college has their IBM machines

prove extremely valuable in the
scene where it is shown that
Grinnell students are treated

that this college is one of the
finest institutions of highel’
learning in the country. How-
ever, we want to be reassured
with data, data which once re-
corded can be actively used by
the College to enhance its repu<
tatan; and specifically, to bet-
ter the bargaining position or

‘l'llicit' Press Item
To the Editor:

The recent rhetorical oul-
pourings of that celebrated
Federalist, Publius, reminded
me somewhat of a sample of
illicit press sent lo me by a
friend at Colorado College. I
am submitting it to the see,
not so much to show Publlus
that nonrsanctioned publica-
tions can be well typed, as to
provide a model for future Pub-
lii to use. It should make their
unsigned treatises more inter-
esting, if less crude.

Jay Williams
Dear Al,

Since you have inquired as to
how 1 am achieving CC’s final so-
lulion to the student problem.

First, the student body must be
subjected to a lot of silly regula-
tions. At cc, of course, we have
rcaliled the difference between
boys and girls, and have therefore
established different regulations
for each. Once each week we make
every male student, in his broun
shirt and green BVD’s, strut
around with a useless stick which
he is laid is the ultimate weapon
in modern \varlare. We do better
with the girls; we give them 24
hour protection. By day we check
their dress, and by night we check
their address.

This unthinking submission
makes it easier lo apply control on
more important matters. We look
the girls up as much as possible.
After 211, boys will be boys, and if
we don't do something about ii,
girls will be mothers. We can
exert this control only because no
force all the girls in live on camp-
us.

Over the years i have found that
student reaction is best overcome
by giving the students useless
tasks which they feel are impor.
tant. Among those front ol'ganua-
tions, a puppet student government
is a must. “Student leaders” must
be elected democratically as role
ing is the American Way. or
course, students must be encour-
aged to establish committees on
administrative matters. Never fear,
this policy is foolproof, for if these
committee ever do anything, you
can easily dissolve them.

it is good to cultivate the solid,
conventional members of the cam-
pus community to serve as your
stooges. Just provide them with
plenty of status — that’s all it
takes. They believe in “freedom
with responsibility” (use that
phrase, it’s catchy!) and as they
have no responsibility, they ask
for no freedom. The students will
want publications. Unfortunately,
freedom of the press is the Amer'
can Way. However. subtle pres-
sure on the editors can achieve
your ends. At all costs, never cen-
501' any publication. it one offend:
you, abolish it. Any illicit publica-
tion must be mihlessly squashed
before the seeds of dissension an
sown. ,
sincerely.

senators played bridge with

day again; Grinnell students
were nominating the candidates
for its highest student govern-

There was serious business at
hand, but not before the 273
delegates had played the con-
vention game to its hilt. it’s an
unwritten law at Grinnell that
nothing serious be done until
the evening session, and this
year’s delegates were not about
to break this rule, at leastl For
three wild hours, a Weird mix-

with Parody as his queen.
Campus problems, world af-
fairs, and the Beatles provided
inspiration for the jag candi~
dates and their speeches, as
well as for the jag ballots of
the delegates.

"Saga‘Skip" Weyrauch was
the first candidate to be offi-
cially nominated. Mike Ml-
nard's nomination speech in
cluded Skip’s platform, “Every-
thing eats," and his promise of
unlimited second helpings. Skip
himself made a triumphant ap-
pearance from the depths of a

David Sellergren Advocates Consistency With Flexibility,
Wants To Stimulate Sense othesponsibility On Campus

The relationships of the men
of north campus are to be
,viewed with an eye to realism.
Rule changes, individual ac-
tion, structural
o r g anizations,

‘ student a f t i~
tudes are all a
p e rt of the
Grinnell C o l-éﬁj
lege Commun-
lty. Emphasis
should rightly
be placed on
t h e students’
welfare. Real»
ism is a term ’
which is the key SELLERGREN
for leadership, and this realism
must be implemented so as to
benefit the students' Welfare.

Consequently, the role of the
Coil-1P is to stimulate a sense of
responsibility among the men.
The men are their own best rep-
resentatives. Consistehcy both
in attitude and, resultantly. in
rule enforcement can be both
an end and a means. Consisten<
cy cannot, however, mean uni-
formity since such an equation

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ignores the flux and dynamics
of the real situation. Consist-
ency is to be the ideal—a real-
izable ideal within a year’s
time if we recognize the guide

’ lines and limitations of the de-

mands of social order, If we
wish to alter the limitations

. presently set down for us, we

must work within those limita-
tions and accept responsibility
for them in order to implement
change. '

On the other hand, the Coil-1P
must be flexible: Intimate, per—
sonal relationships in Grinnell
College are close and in a State
of flux. Only' the hall Council
and the elected hall leader, the
hall president, know the at-
mosphere of their respective
hall; these are best able to
judge situations and make
choices. They must, however,
bear in mind the limitations and
intimacy of north campus life.
Flexibility holds primary im-
portance because of the dual
purpdse of the CofHP—that pur<
pose being problem solving and
representation.

 

The purpose is best achieved

 

through a re-establishment of
rapport among students, stu-
dent leaders, administration
and faculty. Through individual
and joint action with the stu—
dents and other divisions of
student government, the Coil-[P
Should strive to instill mutual
trust with the administration
and our fellows. The dual pur<
poses of CofHP are interde-
pendent, and rapport must be
established to erase any dis-
tinctions.

Grinnell College is unique in
several instances which are, at
this time, best confronted in a
realistic manner, First, the stu-
dents are isolated both physi<
Cally and in their ideals. Sec
ond, the distinct men’s resi-
dence hall system is such that
each hell is autonomous and
mutually responsible to the
Whole. Third, the advent of a
new, unknown Dean of Men
provides an opportunity to re
establish satisfactory relation—
ships. The CofHP Ought to be
organized to meet the unique
ness of the total situation.

David Sellergren

 

Read Cites Need for CotltP Progress in Two Areas;
Student-Faculty Discussions and Enforcement of Rules

I feel that progress within the
CofHP must occur in two
areas: student-faculty discus-
llon and rule enforcement, The
ovents and att‘
t‘udes of this
past year have
disclosed o u r
w e a k n e sses.

The rift be-
tween students
And faculty in,
regard to the
discussion and
establishment of
social and aca-
demic policies
ls n 0 longer “A"
practical. The aftermath of the
Boar‘s Head Dinner revealed
that many faculty members
are interested in our problems
and can offer pertinent sug-
gestions. Mainly they are will-
ing to sit down and talk with
us. Meeting in small informal
groups, students and faculty
can consider a wide range of
subjects, perhaps entirely un-
related to immediate college
problems. Though with no par-

Republicans Name
Convention Heads

Young Republican President
Bob Savage has announced the
names of those students who
are chairmen of the candidate
campaigns for the mock politi-
cal convention to be held in
April.

They are Robin Converse,
Goldwater: P e t e r Kollman,
Rockefeller; Barb B e n d a,
Lodge; Laurie Houdek, Scran-
ton; John TePaske, Nixon; Ken
‘Adelman, Romney; Larry Hutt-
gren, Margaret Chase Smith.

Savage also announced the
appointment of Jim Stoddart as
head of publicity and general
effects for the congention.

ticular action in mind, these
discussions can result in pro-
posals for the improvement of
our academic and social life.

I propose the i 'ation of stu-

’ dent-faculty discussions on a

fairly regular but highly flex-
ible schedule. Each individual
hall would decide the time,
topic, and participating faculty
of these discussions. Evaluation
and synthesis of these discus-
sions would‘occur within the
CofHP.

This year we have witnessed
a decline in the respect for
rules, Too easily many of us,
if we have disagreed with a
rule, have violated it. Those
charged with responsibility
have too frequently looked the
other way, Grinnell is a society
Whose rules reflect the con-
cerns not only of students but
also the College President,
T r u Ste e 5. Administration,
Alumni, Faculty and our par-
ents. If a majority of students
disagree with a regulation or
hesitate to enforce it, then they
must work with these other in»
terests to effect a new policy.
Yet the very essence of law and
student government depends up-
on the enforcement of existin
rulesi '

I believe that the majority
of students now realize the need
for rule enforcement but at the
same time racknowledge the
presence of certain policies
which inhibit proper enforce-
ment. I propose that individual
halls be allowed to impose pen-
alties for many violations now
under the jurisdiction of the
Men's Primary Court. This pro
cedure can facilitate the en-
forcement of certain rules, in
particular open rooms and ilr
legal visitations, and has prov-
en effective in some halls this
year. Until this method is legal~

 

ized, I expect that each hall
would enforce present rules,

 

thus insuring a sound basis for
future liberalizetions.

If it is to be a year of change,
let us have it prefaced with re-
sponsibility and discussion,
Some changes are certain and
I hope an earnest evaluation of
our attitudes toward rules, to-
ward the larger goals of Grin-
nell life, and toward the im-
provement of our community
will be among them. To these
ends I pledge my strongest ef-
fort.

McKlveen for Rules Changes
To Suit the Students' lclecils

Responsibility is not defined
solely as upholding the laws of
a system, although this is cer-
tainly necessary for maintain-

ing the stabil-
ity of a system,
and for achiev»'
ing the goals -
for which the
system is estab-
lished Respon»
sibility ,
may be defined
as recognizing
the necessity

for c h a n g e 5

Within the exist-

ing s ys t e m. McKLVEEN
Neglect of this second aspect
of responsibility is just as ser-
ious as negleCt of the first.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

While at Grinnell it is expect-
ed that we take every advan-
tage of the academic opportuni-
ties; it is also desirable for the
individual to recognize and ac-
cept his social responsibil' ’es,
Ideally the social responsib i»
ties of the student, like that of
the citizen, are to act in a man-
ner which will promote Com-
munity harmony and cause no
discomfort or harm to others.

At Grinnell the ideal system of
rules could be limited to those
which prevent deliberate harm to
others. One rule would he suffi»
cient to insure that ideal, a rule
pertaining to disorderly conduct,
including a quiet hour provision.
The purpose of the legislative body
at Grinnell is to legislate only
those rules which the student body
wants, Again ideally, the system of
rules should accommodate the
beliefs which the student body
holds; moreover, the student body
should not be forced to adhere
to laws in which it doesn‘t believe.
it is to be realized that there will
be a time lag between the evolue
tion of student social practices and
the passage of laws consistent with
these practices.

is to determine ﬂie ideals of the
men of North Campus. He
should attempt to influence the
administration and the Senate
to negotiate a system of laws
consistent with the ideals which
the student body holds. I be-
lieve that we need only two im-
mediate rule changeFan ex-
tension of car privileges, and
opendorms on Friday nights
and Sunday afternoons placed
on a permanent basis. If the
opportunity presents itself, I
will support abolition of the
rule prohibiting coed drinking
in openrdorms.

It is also the duty of the Pres-
ident of the C of HP to Com-
municate directly with the
Trustees of ﬁne College and the
Board of Overseers. If elected,
i would feel it my duty to re-
main on campus after Com-
mencement to provide the Oh
ficers of the College with a full-
er understanding of student
opinion and social practices.>I
would also encourage the House
Presidents to stay for the same
purpose.

Under the existing hall sys-
tern, we find that different halls
have different identities. These
differences of hall personality
make uniform rule enforcement
difficult. This inconsistency is
inevitable within the hall sys-
tem, although it should not be
encouraged. Different social
practices exist in the halls and
different values are held by the
house president and the house
Council. The President of the
C of HP can not force house
presidents to adopt identical
enforcement policies, but he
can encourage them to be sensi-
tive to the social ideals of his
particular hall. Until a consen-
sus exists, this is the most rea~
sonable and accepted policy to
follow in the enforcement of
rules. Once the student body
holds a common idea about a.
law, as the liquor law in the
past, it is not a difficult pro-
cedure to get the law passed by
the Senate and accepted by the
administration.

The court system may be made
more effective by revising the pen-
alties, making them more realistic.
The courts would then become the
practical mechanism of legal con-
sistency, rather than a theoretical
one as they now seem to be. An
example 3f an unrealistic penalty
is the possi lity of supension for
two late violations of open dorms
By enhancing the effectiveness of
the court system, pressures on the
house council will be diminished.
The courts, were created to judge
violators, and they should judge.

Ultimately, we must secure
laws consistent with the ideals
and practices of the Student
body.

MncGregor lauds Congressional Output;
Strout Weighs Procedural Inadequncies

By Glen Ashmon

Robert Strout, Washington
correspondent for the Christian
Science Mani-
tor, delivered
the first formal
lecture in the
Student Sym-
posium session
dealing with
The Legislative
last Thursday
evening in Her-
rick Chapel. His
t a l k, “What's
W r0 n g with
Congress," smouT
dealt primarily with the proced-
ural inadequacies of the Na~
tional Legislature.

Strout pointed out that “safe-
ty (checks and balances) was
built into the Congress, not ef~
ficiency." He singled out the
seniority rule for choosing con-
gressional committee chairmen
and the Senate filibuster rule
for critical examination.

“America is the only state
that recognizes longevity rather
than ability in choosing its
legislative leaders. The aver-
age age of committee chairmen
is 76 years. Besides this, com~
mittee chairmen are often op-
posed to the legislation they are
to consider; as a result, a
single man can prevent a majbr
presidential bill from ever be»
ing considered.”

According to Strout, the Sen-
ate filibuster rule ranks high
among congressional ineffici-
encies. Because of this rule
there is a danger that the gov-
ernment cannot govern. Strout
said that‘southerners and sena-
tors from small states reap the
most advantage from the rule.
Consequently, it is usually im»
possible to obtain a two—thirds
majority to envoke cloture.

Strout further criticized Con-
gress on the following points:

1. Congress has opposed elec<
tronic voting which would con-
siderably speedup legislative
procedure in the two cham»
bers.

2. Congress has failed to act
on redistricting, though repeat-
edly asked to do so. This bur-
den, therefore, has fallen on the
courts. _

3. Congress has allowed many
of its powers to be eroded by
courts and the White House be-
cause of inaction.

4. Congress has allowed new
representatives too little time

p to adjust. Consequently, the
term of office for a congress-
man should be extended to four
years.

5. Congress has never come
up with an adequate system of
budget control.

Strout suggested the need to
reassemble and centralize the
powers of various congression—
al committees. He further ad-
vocated the adoption of a pro—
cedure that will at least assure
voting on top" priority presi»
dential bills.

“What’s right with congress
iar outweighs What’s wrong
with Congress," .

C o n g ressman
Clark MacGreg<
or (R - Minn.)
said in a speech
Friday morning
in H e r r'i c k g,
Speak-
ing on the topic
“What’s Wrong
With Congress,"
he wa s the .

of s p e a k erg Mueenrson
brought to the campus by the
Student Symposium, “The
Democratic Process in an Era
of Crisis.”

He asserted that the truth
about Congress lies somewhere
between the expressed belief of
President Johnson in the ability
of Congress, and the statement
of Representative Richard Boll-
ing (D—Mo.) that Congress is
not visible under its present
structure. This truth, MacGreg-
or said, “can best be found
through an analysis of party re-
sponsibility.”

He listed some things that he
said were right about the first
session oi the 88th Congress:
the passage of the “bricks and
mortar provision" for higher
education and other education
measures, which were followed
by appropriations to carry
them out; "the willingness of
Congress to remain in session
111/; months”; the hard work
the Congress djdveven though
it might not have been evident
since much of it was done in
committee.

As an example of the last
point, he traced the develop
ment of the Civil Rights bill in
the House—especially in the
Judiciary committee, of which
he is a member. “In the field
of civil rights,’ this Congress
can hold its head high so far,”
he said. '

MacGregor cited the work
done by individual members of
Congress in formulating pro-
posals to improve the legisla-
tive body. This kind of think-
ing, he said, was also right
about Congress, l-l listed some
proposals or indi dual mem-
ber's of the House:

1. that the Rules Committee
be limited to 21 days in consid-
eration of a bill coming to it
from a legislative Committee.

2. that a joint committee on
the budget be established.

it that a committee to rec-
ommend specific reorganiza-
tional structural changes be
established.

4. the publication of public
funds expended by members
of Congress.

5. some members have taken
the lead in disclosing their own
personal holdings so that any
conﬂict of interests can be
seen.

Criticism. he said. must be
informed and responsible, and
it must consider the responsi-
bilities of the parties. “No
legislative body in a free gov-
ernment anywhere in th e
world," he said, allows the av-
erage citizen to have his pres-
ence felt as does the Congress
of the United States."

Pioneers lose to Beloi'tv,VC

By Pete Kollman

Grinnell’s basketball team
dropped two games on the road
last weekend, losing to Beloit
Friday night, 90—61, and to Coe
on Saturday, 9130. The losses
dropped the Pioneers to fifth
place in the Midwest Confer-
ence standings.

Friday night Grinnell trav-
eled to Beloit to take on the
Buccaneers. The less said
about the game the better; the
Pioneers played one of their
worst games of the year. Grin-
nell fell behind at the begin-
ning and the margin steadily
increased, reaching 15 at half-
time, 39724. Beloit continued
where they left off when the
second half started and contin-
ued to roll up the score.

Bright spots in the Grin-
,nell effort were , ell-captains
Jim Mifflin and John Sundell.
Mifflin hit 8 for 13 from the
field enronte w 25 points and
Sundell showed he had recov-
ered from the illness which
hampered him last weekend
by snagging 21 rebounds.

Saturday night was a happier
story, although the result
looked the same in the stand-
ings. Grinnell jumped off to an
early lead, but the Kohawks
came right back to tie the game
at halftime, 47417.

The Pioneers recovered from
meir Friday night deep freeze
by shooting 50 percent the first
half. The entire second half
was a see-saw battle, somewhat
like the St. Olaf game 2 Weeks
earlier. The Pioneers lead by
four with three and a half min-
utes to play but the Kohawks
regained the advantage and a
lest-second basket by Sundell
was of no avail.

Jeff F r s n t z, sophomore
guard, along with senior co»
captains, turned in noteworthy
performances. Frantz lead the
Pioneers with 27 points. closely
followed by Mifflln’s 26.

Co-Capluins Sundell. Mifflin
Eye Musser's School Records

Grinnell’s basketball co-Cap-
tains, Jim leflin and John
Sundell, are quickly closing in
on one season and two career
marks held by Pioneer John
Musser (’56), older brother of
Bob Musser ('62).
In the scoring department,
Mifflin, a forward who is cer-
tain to join the “LOW-point
club” in Iowa this weekend,
could, by maintaining his’ cur-
rent 21.2 point, average, slip
post Musser in career scor-
ing.
with five games left, Mifflin
has come up with 329 points this
season, giving°him a three-year
total of 994. This leaves him
just 10!) markers shy of Mus-
ser's pacersetting 1103 points.

Grinnell’s Pioneers return
home this weekend to try and
break out of the slump that has
cost the Scarlets six of their
last seven games. Tonight at
7:30 p.m. the cagers meet the
Lawrence Vikings in Darby
Gymnasium and tomorrow air
ternoon at 1:30 p.m. face
league-leading Ripon.

Coach John Pfitsch's main
problem is still the question
of finding someone to back
up his 1-2 punch of Jim Miff-
lin and Jeff Frantz. Since the
departure of sophomore
guard Gordy Kinkead at sem-
esters, Plitsch has been un-
able to find a third Pioneer
who can consistently hit in
double figures.

Last week Mifflin scored 51_
points to boost his average to
21.2, among the leaders in the
Midwest Conference. Frantz
rebounded from an offrnight at
Beloit to pour in 27 points
against Coe and keep his aver.
age right around the 17 point
mark. But aparrirom these two.
no other Pioneers can be found5
among the top is scorers.

However, John Sundell, chiefr
ly known for his rebounding,
had one of his best offensive
nights of the year in the 91.90‘
loss to the Kohawks with 19
points. Rounding out the lineup
tonight will probably be Clyde
Smith and Dave Sellergren, al-
though Randy Morgan, Dick Ul»
rich and Ted Risser are all
slated for action.

Tonight's opponent, Law.
rence, is currently in sixth
place in the conference, one
slot'behind Grinnell. The Vik-
ings played only one game last
Week and looked good although
dropping a rather one-sided
game to neighboring Ripon.

The big gun for the Blue and
White this year is Joel Ungrodt,
a 5'9" sharp shootibgguardl
with a 21 point average. Un-
grodt finished in the top five in

Pogo hurl

oe; Drop to Fifth,

last year’s scoring race and
is a good bet to do so again this
year. L i k e Grinnell, Lawn
rence’s big problem is finding
someone to batik up Ungrodt.

The Redmen of Ripon seem
headed for a second consecu-
tive basketball crown. Cur-
rently sporting a 13-1 record,
the Wisconsin crew has a two
game margin over second
place Cornell.

Ripon boasts three players
among the top ten scorers.
Gary Mevis is the top point~
maker with close to 22 points
a game. Jack Ankerson, of
gridiron renown. has a 19
point average, and Jim Cahoon
a 17 point average. Also fre-
quently hitting in double ﬁg-
ures is another Ankerson, Doug.

Harlshorne ls Against Delerlninism,

Although the Greeks “saw
nature as highly orderly." they
had little empirical evidence
for their' belief. During the
Newtonian era the startling dis<
coveries of natural regularities
made the notion of Strict deter»
minism seem “both clearer and
more credible," he said.

Any suggestion of chance or

deterministic science and phi-
losophy ensued.

Hume, Kant, Spinoza and
Leibniz were all determinists;
it was not until the nineteenth
century that some less re-
nowned philosophers began to
credit the idea of chance.
Peirce, an American, developed
the theory of Tychism named
forthe Greek word for chance,
“Whose reality Peirce not only
affirmed, but with penetrating
reason accepted as a universal
aspect of all nature.”

In working with Darwin’s
theory of natural selection,
Mendcl’s laws of inheritance.
Gibbs' phase law in chemistry,
and the laws of quantum me-
chanics, ”a usable determin-
ism seems out of the question.”

Hartshorne believes we are
entering a new intellectual
phase in which ”terms like
chance, randomness, probabil-
ity, possibility are no longer to
be dismissed a ‘word of our ig-
norance.’ ”

Hume and Kant tried to make
“religious sense out of the
Newtonian world machine."
“The resulting religious deter-
minism led to a dual‘concept of
freedom. God's decisions are
free in that there are no condi-
tions determining them. We,
however, are free to make de-
cisions in a totally different
sense, for our acts are precise—
ly what antecedent conditions
determine them to be.

Hartshorne asserts, ”In real<
ity, neither causality nor pur-
pose is intelligible without
chance.”

“The reasonable view of cau-
sation is . . . that causal con-
ditions limit the then-and-there
possible outcomes, but do not
in advance completely define or
determine a unique outcome."
This self-determination of out-
come is 'frcedom in the meta-
physical or universal sensor"

He pointed out that “though
the particular event is by
chance, uhe‘laws or regularities
in events are not. And it is
these we need to know in ad-
vance, not the' precise events
themselves,"

Purpose is also related to
chance because purpose is es-
sentially social. There are al-

lvey Cartoon Collection Includes Work
0i Two Centuries From [1.5. and Abroad

The cartoons currently on
display in the Schaeffer Gal-
lery and in the Student Union
represent the two-century his-
tory of cartooning.

From the collection of James
Ivey, a San Francisco cartoon-
ist, the exhibit includes original
drawings from great cartoon~
ists starting with Gillray, “the
grandfather of modern political
cartooning,” and ending with
Rube Goldberg, an American
newspaper cartoonist.

The exhibit contains examples
of the work of Honore Daumier
whowas imprisoned during the
early nineteenth century for
ridiculing the French monarchy
in his caricatures.

Father of th 6 American
School of political cartooning,
Thomas Nast created many of
the symbols still used today.

ways a number of purposes
held by a number of purposive
agents,

He gave the example, “Sup-
pose A intends x and B intends
Y, and both are’ successful;
then what ensues is XY. No
one intended XY," ,

Hartshorne explained the
this formula applies even if B
is God; “His decision must con-
join with others’ in a manner
not wholly intended even by
him.”

To say that this implies weak~
ness in God is “nonsense.”
“God is not weak just because
he cannot do what intrinsicah
1y could not be done."

"Randomness is coming into
its own," Hartshorne conclud-
ed. "Should not the idea of real
freedom, creaturely and divine,
now have its opportunity at
last?"

 

The "only truly American art
form" is the comic strip, also
well represented in the collec-
tion, The first daily strip, “A.
Mutt” by Bud Fisher started in
the San Francisco Chronicle in
1907. ‘ '

The New Yorker's one-line
cartoons contributed to the
sophistication of American hu-
mor.

Throughout the history oi
cartooning, methods of repro-
ducing cartoons were chang
ing. Gillray and his contempor-
ary, George Cruickshank, used
engravings: Daulnier, lith0<
graphy; Nast, woodrcuts; and
modern cartoonists, photo en-
graving.

Circulated by the Western As-
sociation of Art Museums, the
collection will remain at Grinw
nell until March 4. .

Rube Goldberg, in a “fore-
word” to the exhibition catalog,
reiers to items in the collec-
tion as “original works of art—
and 1 say works of art advised-
1y."

”There are 'ﬂiose, unfamiliar
with the great scope of car-
tooning, who believe mat cars
t o o n i s t s are irresponsible
zanies accidentally gifted with
the facility of putting scrawls
on paper to amuse the chil-
dren. They do not realize that
it is a painstaking craft, a call-
ing that requires a vast fund
of knowledge acquired through
concentration and experience.
“Cartoons are drawn not only
to amuse but to bring a visual
understanding of human foibles
and social injustices," he adds.
