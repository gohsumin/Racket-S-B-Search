In Concert Series

Ahrio Diaz, internationally
known classic guitarist will ap
pear in concert at Roberts
lllheatre tonight and tomorrow
night at s p.111. ‘

His program will include a
variety of pieces for classic
guitar ranging from the Renais-
sance to the present. Included

in the program are the compo«
sitions of Milan, J. 5. Back.
Scarlatti, Villa—Lubes, and Al-
beniz.

Diaz was born in Venezuela
in 1923, and started his musical
studies in Caracas. In later
study at the Conservatory of
Music in Madri d he was
awarded the coveted “Prize Ex-
triaordinary."

The young artist pursued his
advanced musical education in
Europe where he was a pupil of
Andres Segovia at the Accade»
mia Musicale Chigi‘ana in Siena,
Italy,

Segovia praised both the mu-
sical and technical mastery of
his pupil and soon appointed
him his assistant in teaching
Accademia classes. At the start
of Diaz’ career, Segovia named
him, “a true artist, free from
any influence extraneous to his
own rich personality."

From September to mid-June,
Diaz tours the world giving
concerts in North and South
America, and throughout the

 

world. He made his New York
debut in 1959 and last. January
presented his latest Town Hall
recital. At that time the New
York Times said:

“Mr. Diaz played with deli—
cacy, formal balance, and a
sense of continuity. It was an
exquisite and aristocratic per—
formance.”

During the summer months
he continues, with Segovia, to
teach at the A‘ccademia, where
students of the classic guitar
come from all parts of the
world.

The programs this Weekend

Holimonn Sees Recognition 0!
Red China As logical Step In
Modern French Foreign Policy

‘ By JOHN WOLF

France's recognition of Red
China was explained as a logi-
cal step in French foreign pol-
icy by Stanley Hoffmann in his
5 e c o n d Rosenfield lecture,
”France, the United States, and
Nato," given yesterday in Her-
rick Chapel.

France, claimed Hoffmann,
realizes the difficulty of fight-
ing in SouDheast Asia; there«
fore France would rather nego-
tiate with Peiping, no matter
how long and difficult negotia-
tions might be.

Further, France would feel
more secure it more than two
super-powers existed in the
world, a united Europe would
offset the power of the U.S.,
and a strong Red China would

stabilize the Communist situ-

ation.

The establishment of an axis
between would-be nuclear na-
tions is another French consid-
eration in establishing relations
with the Peiping government.

The first part of Hoffmann's
lecture was a view of the im-
pact of the U.S. on French so
ciety and on French intellectu-
als Since World War II.

Hoffmann first explained that
between 1945 and 1958, ”Al-
though French foreign policy
generally followed the pattern
set by the U.S., the American
impact was badly received.
Since 1958, however, the situa-
tion has been reversed, and now
France has accepted the Amer-
ican impact but has followed
its own foreign policy.

Under a new grant of $28,987
from th e National Science
Foundation to Grinnell College,
the Grinnell Behavior Science
Institute will be held on cam-
pus this summer for the third
successive year.

Expanded from seven weeks
to nine weeks, the institute will
run from Sunday, June 14,
through Saturday, Aug. is. Its
director again will be Dr. Neil
D, Kent, associate professor of

part one of the Junior Liberal Arts Ex-
ednesday and officially started the in-

 

highsability secondary school
students, the institute began in
1962 with a $20,750 NSF grant
and continued last year with a
524,890 award from the same
source. It is the only such pro-
gram in the country to be sup-
ported by the NSF.

Its purposes are to identify
secondary school students who
have potential for becoming
scientists. to accelerate their
scholarly development through
instruction by scientists of rec
ognized stature. and to develop
cooperation between colleges
and high schools in increasing
the quality of education in the
sciences.

Enrollment will be open to
approximately 45 students of
exceptional ability and promise
who have completed their jun-
ior. but not their senior, year
in high school and who have
good backgrounds in science
and mathematics.

Instruction Will be offered by
Griiinell faculty members and
v i s i t i n g scientists in five
courses: Introduction to the
Philosophy of SClence, Experi-
mental Analysis of Behavior,
introduction to Psychological
Research, Psychological Statis-
tics, a nd General Experi-
mental Psychology.

Lectures Will be supplemented
by intensive laboratory work
and programmed learning ma-
terial. During the last two
weeks of the session Students
will have an opportunity to ex7
ecute an independent study of
their own design.

 

Hoffmann outlined several
changes which have arisen
because of the American im-
pact. A youth culture has ap-
peared, the bourgeois culturo'
has given way to a mass cul-
ture due to mass communica-.
tions, and education has be-
come quantitative rather than
qualitative.

Hoffmann concluded his leo-
ture with an inspection of
Charles de Gaulle's foreign pol:
icy.

First, he stressed, as Gaullc
is not an isolated character in
his (1 e s i r e for grandeur.
“Whereas most French people
might not be concerned with
grandeur, they are very mucli
concerned with decline. There.
fore, the Gaullist appeal to pow-
er goes over very well.”

France’s main concern un-
der de Gaulle has been foreign
affairs. De Gaulle sees France
as perpetually oscillating be-
tween decline and grandeur.
Therefore, France must have

a large world goal in ordev
to keep the country from bick-
ering‘over domestic issues.

De Gaulle sees history of ah
fairs as a play in which til!
countries are the actors.

”It is the duty of statesme -

In Our Opinion . . .

l With the inauguration of any new administration
some statement of policy is always in order. In the
case of the campus newspaper it seems especially ap-
propriate because of the prevalent conception that the
Scarlet and Black has no policy or that its policy as
such isn’t worth much.

Shortly after the election of a new editor it be-
came apparent that some students feared the editorial
licy would be pro-administration ~— a policy which
hey stated, would violate the concept of a “student
press.” Their reasoning demanded that a student se—
ected by students put out a newspaper representing
the students .

, Although such a policy seems logical on the sur—
face, the flaw, on this campus, exists in the idea that
such a ”student” paper must be violently opposed to
anything the administration does or says, because this
represents the “student” stand.

While supposed supporters of the “student” stand
make their position known by individual noises in their
respective offices on campus, the majority of students,
who are simply interested in having a good, informa-
tive, and entertaining newspaper, stand by and shake
their heads.

Ever since it was announced that a new editor
wouldassume the top position on the S and B masthead
for 1964, one of the hotly discussed issues on campus
concerned whether the paper would be pro»administra-
tion or pro—students, or in other words, would the Week-
1y rag be a scandal sheet or a house organ?

Does it seem impossible, in light of this debate, to
introduce a policy whereby the S&B would be a news-
paper with news in the reported columns, side~choosing
In the opinion columns, and a general, overall practice
of representing each group and individual related to the
college? This, we feel, is the news function of a good
college newspaper, This will be the foundation of edi~
torial policy for the 5&8 during 1964.

We will attempt to do an objective job of covering
“all" the news. The individual columns and the “letters
to the editor" department will be the campus forum
for opinion, discussion and debate. The editorial col-
umn will present the editorial voice and opinions of
the S&B on those issues we feel have particular signi-
ﬁcance for the Grinnell College community.

In this latter category of
awards are those given by the

FROM TIME MAGAZINE

If the most popular of the lib.
eral arts is the art of snowing
the grader on exams, how
should the grader respond?
During December 'this question
cropped up in the first exami-
nation of examinations at Harl-
vard in 15 years.

The answer given by William
G. Perry, Jr., director of Har-
vard's-Bureau of Study Coun—
sel, is that snowbound student
bluebooks should be divided in-
to two Classes. “Bull" is opinv
lori without supporting (actl.
“Cow” is fact: without under»
standing. It the grader has to
make a choice between these
two categories, says Perry. ho
should take bull every time.

According to Perry, “bull in
pure form is rare: there is usu.
ally some “contamination by
data." But even in its purest
form, bulling “expresses an im-
portant part of what a plural-
ist university holds dear, sure-
ly a more important part than
the collecting of ‘facts that are
facts,’ which schoolboys learn
to do.”

Unlike the cower, says Perry.
the bullor is close to being “in
a strong position to learn com
lent rapidly and meaning hilly,
and retain it. I have learned to
be less concerned about the
education of a Student who has
come to understand the nature
of man’s knowledge, even
though he has not yet com.
mitted himself to hard work,
than I am about the education
of the student who, after one
or two terms at Harvard, is
working desperately hard and
still believes that collected

 

"facts” constitute knowledge.“

King Resigns from Grinnell Post
.To Assume Vanderbilt Position

Dr. Winston L. King, Rand
professor of Applied Christian-
ity, is resigning from the Grin-
nell faculty to take a new po~
Eition this fall at Vanderbilt
University in Nashville, Ten-
hessee.

At Vanderbilt he will be
ﬁrefessor of the history of re-
‘gions. He will be officially a
member of the Divinity School
faculty but will be teaching in
the university itself at both the
undergraduate and graduate
levels.

Joining the Grinnell faculty
in 1949, Dr. King was dean of
the chapel until 1963 when he
relinquished his chapel duties
in order to devote more time to
teaching and Writing. During
the current year he holds the
college’s James Morton Rob-

erts Honor Professorship and is-

completing his two year elective
term as faculty chairman.

Dr. King is the author of five
books and has written numerr
ous articles, book reviews, and
chapters in books. His latest
book entitled “A Thousand
Lives Away,“ is to be published
this year by Bruno Cassirer.

Much of his recent writing has
been based on his experiences
and observations during a two
year leave of absence, from

958 until 1950. During that
time he was a visiting profes-
sor and adviser to the Ford
Foundation at the International

 

Institute for Advanced Buddhis-
tic Studies in Rangoon, Burma,
for 20 months, and a teacher
for four months at Ahmednager
College in India.

Before coming to Grinnell,
Dr. King was minister of the
First Congregational Church in
Waterville, Maine. He received
his BA. degree, magna cum

Dr. Winston L. King

laude, from Asbury College,
Wilmore, Kentucky, his B.Di
and S.T.M. degrees from And-
over Newton Theological Semie
nary, and his Ph. D, from Har~
vard. During World War II he
served in Europe as an Army
chaplain.

Dr. and Mrs. King plan to
leave Grinnell about August 1.

 

Apply Now For Week-in-Wasllington;
Internships Provide Political Insight

Competition has been opened
tor the annual Week-ianashing»
ton political internship pro-
‘gram, the Iowa Center for Edu-
cation in Politics announced
this week.

Sixteen students from lowa
colleges and universities will be
selected to spend an expense-
tree week in the Nation’s Capi-
tal as guests of Iowa Congress-
men.

The students will go to Wash-
ington in groups of two —— one a
Republican and one a Demor
crat. They will be shown the
workings of the Congress and
the political party headquarters
and will be introduced to legisr
lative and party leaders.

The object of the intern-
ships is to provide political
and governmental insights

Hoffmann Views ﬁfth Republic:—
Its Political System Am! Society

By Susan Taylor

There are two sides to the
post-war problems of France,
according to Professor Stanley
Hoffmann, Rosenfield Lecturer,
These are the continuing

troubled history of French poli-
tics, caused by the presence of
so many political parties, and
th e transformation of the
French society in the period fol»
lowing 1945.

Speaking on ”France Under
the Fifth Republic,” Hoffmann,
professor of government at
Harvard University, Wednesday
night analyzed the problem and
discussed the background. the
quest for political stability un-
der De Gaulle, and the pros»
pects for the future.

“In spite of the hopes of re-
juvenation and regeneration
which followed world War ii,
the French were not able to
solve the basic problems of the
instability of the political sys
tem,” he said,

The society was divided on
fundamental issues, I-loifmann
explained. These included ewv
nomic and social divisions
which were not necessarily re-
lated to the equally prevalent
divisions on an ideological ba-
sis and a "division of the tem—
per itself.”

Hoffmann explained that folr
lowing the war, under the gov-
ernment of the Fourth Repub-
lic, a new role of the state
emerged. “The state was for
the first time able to play an
important role in French so-
ciety and Fiench economy."

He explained that the impact
of the transformation of the so»
ciety under the Fourth Repubr
lic had no effect on the politi-
cal system. T h e economic
changes only contributed to the
weakening of the historically
messy political system.

Under General De Gaulle,
who took over the government
in May, 1958, Hoffmann said
that the social and economic
transformation Continued and
accelerated. But, he said, under
De Gaulle's fifth Republic the
changing society has benefitted
from political stability.

According to Hoffmann, De
Gaulle believes that the French
state must be preserved at all
costs against the accidents of
history; that the state must be

constructed “as the common
framework and the guiding
force of the nation”; and that
the state must be a republic.
Under the di sions in the
French society, there is a “la-
tent general will,” and only the
executive can awaken this will.
Parliament cannot, because of
the many divisions it has within
itself. De Gaulle, according to
Hoffmam‘l, realizes that the di-
visions on the surface of the so-
ciety are realities reflected only
too accurately by the parlia-
ment — which leads to “a per-
fect recipe for deadlock," ac—
cording to Hoffmann.

“De Gaulle has become the
dominant element in the sys-
tem,” Hoffmann Said. He has
imposed a strong executive over
the parliamentary republic. In
his constitutional reforms of
1962, he further strengthened
his position by having the pres-
ident elected by universal sub
frage.

But, Hoffmann explained, the
stability imposed by consoli-
dating the dominancy of the
presldency, and by attempting
to force the parties out of their

 

grooves to fight for the election
of the President instead of par.
liamentary seats, is brought “'1‘
to question by me problem of
succession. What will happen
when France no longer has De
Gaulle, Hoffmann said, is the
question most Americans ask.

In asserting the prospects.
Hoffmann pointed out: the lim
fations of the present constiiu.
tional system. “The bottle neck
lies with the parties,” he said,
He also pointed out the tension
between the old parties, and the
new forces, essentially non-p0.
iitical pressure groups and
“think groups” which are play.
ing an active role in the eco.
nomic and social machinery of
the government.

"De Gaulle hopes to reshape
the relation between society
and power,” and to reshape the

parties, Hoffmann asserted. He
must reshape the political sys-
tem such that it will outlast
him. But, Hoffmann said,
“There remain a number of
question marks." At present he
saw no answer as to what the
future of the Fifth Republic
would be.

By Dah Little

One of the cogent (printable) things that numerous critics
have called the Scarlet and Black, affectionately known to many
critics as the “Scab," its “a historical record of the momentous
and noose-momentous events mat take place within the confines
of Grinnell College." To fulfill this noble function and give our
readers a pleasant, nostalgic trip through the recent past we will
recount some of those events that helped to make that the semes-
ter that was

The semester started with a splash. Approximately 1150 stu-
dents converged on what, in some circles, was affectionately
known as the "ol’ Swimmin’ hole" to find that the ancient “N0
Swimming" sign had been removed and the forbidding "3.2
Lake” legally opened to qualiﬁed swimmers. The rejoicing and
revelry caused by the removal of that moschovered sign will

_doubtless echo in the respective loggias for years.

It was a semester of rule change and important d isions on
campus life, The students were suspicious of the admi istration,
the administration was suspicious of the faculty, the faculty was
suspicious of everybody and President Bowen left the country.

The Grinnell Nonconformist club forged, or rather putted,
ahead in characteristic progressive style by declaring, through
gritty teeth and moss covered lips, the new Non-club motto, “Two
wheels good, four wheels bad.” The emblem adopted by the group
was entitled, “Ainu Astride 3. Chrome Cyle.”

The Scarlet and Black changed printers, got a much needed
facevlift, came out in glorious red, white and black, held forth the
promise that it would be the finest newspaper ever produced on
the Grinnell College campus; and failed to appear the following
week.

A conservative group of enlightened Grinnell dowsers and
alchemists predicted a deluge of gold water in 1964 followed by
four years of joyous prosperity.

Campus skeptics scoffed at both predictions saying that, if the
first came to pass, the second would necessarily fail. “Anybody
knows that gold water would never make anything grow.”

It was a semester of close communion with nature. Half the
student body spent a weekend talking about “those students” in
a sylvan setting, the men of Clark and Cowles sold down the
river, President Truman bit the dust, and Dean Wood decided to
head for the hills.

President Harry Truman visited the campus as the year’s
official "Politician-in-Residence." Before his visit was over he

, had flopped (in a bush) and the P,P.P.E. was almost committed

to carry Harry,

Construction on the Forum moved ahead at a pace that made
the students currently attending Grinnell wonder “‘for whom?”

The male students and representatives from the faculty and
administration attended a traditional holiday dinner. However,
the three groups couldn’t agree on What tradition was traditional
and when nhe ensuing controversy came to a head it was de-

cided that the whole thing was too booring to argue about and
toasted its abolition,

”Barbie,” Grinnell’s thick-skinned, $75,000 white elephant,
was placed in her cage early in December, But, as if she was no
better than any common, ordinary, “cheap” slab of concrete, she
refused to perform until the temperature got below the freezing
point. ~

The semester officially ended with those Grinnellians, com-
monly called “off men," that couldn’t find their way home look-
ing forward to a rosy field of new lecturers to add to the three
per student total that had already visited the Grinnell campus
during the semester that was. .

Professor C. Edwin Gilmour,
Director of the Program in

securing of the services of Mc-
Gee and Hatfield, says he ex-
pects the keynote addresses to
be ”hardhitting and highly

student body was involved in
the preparation of the platform

You? Have To Get Up Early If You
Want To Beat The Hockey Club

By Karen Adkinson

The Gl‘mnell hockey club
specializes in practices at weird
hours. Last year before the
hockey rink was built, they
practiced on Barber Plaza from
11 to 12:30 at night after the
rink closed to the public. Last
week a warm spell forced them
out of bed whlle the ice was
still frozen to begin practice at
6 am,

Hockey devotees. Russ Har-
din and Jerri Langllam, organ-
ized the Club last year.

Jerri recalled, “Russ and I
both played hockey before
coming to Grinnell and
wanted to get something go-
ing our freshman year, but
only ten boys showed any in-
terest in playing hockey. Last
year we really worked and
thirty guys showed up and
continued coming. Mr. Irv
Simone is our faculty spon-
sor and was instrumental in
getting competition for us.
7 We played a Des Moines Club
several times and the fresh-
man squads of Carleton and
St. Olaf."

This year the club is scrim-
maging on a new rink built with
funds allotted by the President
of the College after a request
by the club. BSrG erected the

'rink over the summer and care

for it during the season.
Twenty-five men are out for
the club this year. Fifteen are

up their little power in face of
the still-powerful lions," he
concluded.
