"ROTC, or the Department of
Aerospace Studies, exists on the
Brlnnell Campus, for the de-

artment and the college iinds
t mutually beneficial," stated
Captain Purdom of the Grin<
IIBll ROTC.

The Captain explained that
ROTC is valuable to the stu-
dent “because it opens up op-
tlons—career options and op-
tlons in meeting military obliga-
tlons. Tile program is flexible
enough that it can grow and
change with the student’s needs;
he gets out oi military service
the most advantageous expein
ience. also, the students get an
opportunity to see what ‘this
military business’ is all about.
It’s important for an educated,
responsible citizen to See what
the issues oi national security
are."

In return, Grinnell students
beneﬁt ROTC by the “sense of
values the liberally educated
man brings to the activities he
engages in. The liberally edu-
cated man brings to ROTC a
Width of mental Vision and a
willingness to question.”

“We don’t help the school fl-
nancially — at least not direct
Iy," stated the Captain. Indirect-
ly, the scholarship money ROTC
gives to students might free
some college money, but the
Captain declared that ROTC is

FREE STORE OPENS
IN LOOSE COATROOM

Loose Hall cloakroom is the
temporary home of Grinnell
College‘s new Free Store, or-
iginated by Bruce Nissen '70.

A Free Store is a market-
place that operates without
money. Supplies ior the store
are donated. Anyone who has
something he feels he does not
need, or would like [0 share or
give away brings it iii—and
these things can be taken by
anyone.

Nissen hoped to locate the
store in the basement of an
off-campus house, but his re-
quests have so far been denied
by 8&6.

A fund-raising drive for the
starving people of Eiafra was
held this past week by a group
of students led by Bruce Nissen
and Cathy Bull. It was
sponsored by both the Board of
Religion and SDS.

On Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday collections were
made at lunch and dinner meals
at both Quad and Cowles. Let-
ters have been written to all the
ministers in Grinnell requesting
them to have collections for
Biafra at the next church ser-
vices.

A suggestion has been made
to the Senate that a fast be held
this semester with all profits
going to Biafra.

Off-Campus Girls
Get New Houses

There are three new off-cam-
pus houses at Grinnell this
year: interracial House, Con-
ference House, and French
House.

Two of the three, interracial
and Conference, were born in
the desire ior understanding
that followed the assassination
of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
French House is the successor
to a similar house that existed
three years ago, according to
its president, Barbara Weitz,
’69. ,

The largest of the
houses is Interracial, With
16 girls. President of the
house is Sherri DesCliamps, ’69,
who was one oi a group respon~
sible for the founding of the
house.

Thirty girls applied to live
in the house last semester, and
each wrote a short essay de<
scribing wily they thought the
house should be started and
what it should do.

Five books are on a planned
reading list, and discussion of
the books will be the equiva-
lent of another course. The
house is also planning to set
up a library with AWARE (As
sociation Di Whites for Advance-
ment of Racial Equality) for
general use to be financed
through funds supplied by the

Linda Cutler, ’70, cannot
open her window as a result
of a change in the heating
system of Main Hall. in the
past, each resident or the
hall could control the temv
perature of her own room by
a knob on the radiator. Now
there is a central thermos
tat for the hall, located in
Cutler’s room.

She is told that opening her
window would affect this
central thermostat and tllus

Picnic Posier
Makes Diggers,
Saga Slew

"steal silverware from Saga,"
advised a poster advertising
Saturday night’s digger picnic
at Conference House. It was
rumored on campus that Ralph
Pomerenk, Director of Resi-
dences, intended to close Cnn-
ference House because he was
so angered by the poster’s pro-
pasal.

It was also said that all in
ventory oi Saga silverware
would be taken before and after
the Saturday evening meal in
order to bill Conference House
for any spoons and ibrks found
missing, Neither rumor was
substantiated.

Bruce Nissen, the poster mak-
er, accepted respoiisibility lor
the “steal silverware” idea. Nis-
sen, a Loose Hall junior, said,
“Pomerenk is conducting a
witch hunt against the off-cam-
pus houses. He tried to enrol-

/nate them this year. The digger
dinner got him maddest.”

Why Pomerenk was most
angry about the dinner Nissen
could not explain. Several stu<
dents gave accounts similar to
Nissen’s.

The president of Conference
House, Catherine Jones, ‘69,
said she had heard nothing
about the closing of the house.
She surmised that Pomerenk
“was afraid that the house was

At present there are 45 ca-

Grinncll has not met its quota
In the last new years. Thereiore
the sub-detachment at Grinllell

Editorial . . .
The Election

In an interview, newly elected C of HP Presi-
dent Lee Maril said he wanted to make the position
as important as the AWS Board head. Only 20%
of the male students voted and he received only
11% of the votes.

This hardly represents a mandate, and he may
find difficulties in achieving his aim. Two conclu-
sions may be drawn, The students failed to partici-
pate in their own governmental system, and, as a
result, Maril will be forced, whether he wants to or
not, into representing his own views rather than
those of the electorate

A Good Change

Although it is said that the proper place of
women is with men, in the past at Grinnell men and
women have been separated. The women, through
the shyness which befits the gentle sex, except on
rare occasions, chose to stay on South Campus. The
men usually preferred to remain in masculine com-
pany on North Campus. In a society in which men
and women are intellectually equal, it is only civ-
ilized for them to be in the company of one another.

The nature of things dictates that women will
have a taming influence upon men. The proximity
of women surely will help to remove some of the
jungle conditions that used to exist in the boys’
dormitories and Cowles dining room.

A Fine Action . . .

Last year one or two students saw an oppor-
tunity for a new course to be offered in the Depart-
ment of Philosophy and Religion, the course in
ethics. Working tediously with the faculty and ad-
ministration, and despite abundant bureaucratic
obstacles, they developed the curriculum of a course
which is currently being taught.

The Scarlet and Black commends this action,
which represents student responsibility in its most
thoughtful and effective form, and it is a sign that
genuine change in the structure of the college is
possible when serious effort is made.

The Community Bicycles

Last year, through the efforts of the David M.
Gibson Memorial Newsletter and some other efforts,
eight bicycles were purchased to be used as com-
munity bicycles. These bicycles, which were to be
markedly distinguished, would be ridden by any
student who happened upon one. The rule was that
the bicycles should be left on campus. Before the
painting of the bicycles, however, two of them per-
manently disappeared. When the remaining six
were placed on campus, they were often misused,
thrown around, left in town, and sometimes taken
for private use.

It was a noble experiment, one depending on
the essential goodness of human nature. Perhaps
because of Adam’s fall, perhaps because of ignor-
ance of the proper way to treat bicycles, the venture
failed. The bicycles remain now by Loose Hall un-
used, broken. and chained.

Collogrophs
Depress Critic

By Mllvn ANDERSON
Ari Major

Reaction to the Glen Alpl
Coiiographs now on exhibit in
Scheaffer Gallery has been un-
fierstandably weak. The works,
which date from 1958 to 1961,
are not the only, nor the best,
representatives of the colic-
graph technique. They are, at
best, explorations into a "new”
printing technique and the
forms suggested by it to the art-
ist’s imagination.

Use of collage and intagiio
in the printing process has pro-
duced a striking range of tex-
tures. Textures and values alone
create form and depth.

Most of Alps‘ works, however,
do not explore depth, and in
many the form is ﬂat and
tricky.

The parts, or pieces, of the
patterns are intriguing, but the
overall effect is unmoving. Con-
scious awareness of materials
and design displaces total aes-
thetic experience, This aware-
ness, in a truly great work, is
analytical and only subsequent
to experience. ln other words,
creative design should evoke an
aesthetic emotion which is
greater than the sum of its
parts.

Alps has come closest to
achieving this in his more or-
ganic and expressionistic works
where an intense linear vitality
creates movement and mood.
in these works depth is most
effectively rendered; the black
ls a distant. haunting shadow;
in the foreground, aggressive,
menacing white forms move.

“Where Th Truth Lles

By DONALD STUMP

The first issue of Pterodactyl
contains s large dose of obscene
words and, to state the case as
fairly as i can, tasteless car-
toons. One drawing depicts pigs
in police helmets preparing to
eat their own excrement and
another shows cops in the act

of raping personifications of
Liberty and Justice.

1 would not bother to hrlng
up the vulgarities, except that
to include such pictures has be-
came a deliberate policy of the
paper; and the policy seems to
be at odds with the express
purpose of the staff to win peo-
ple over to a “radical alterna-
tivai’. The obscenity is apparent«
1y 8 part of that alternative,
and I Wonder why.

It seems to me that to per<
suade people to climb out on a
radical political limb the best
strategy would be to humor the
peoples' sensibilities and avoid
estranging them needlessly. It
is foolish to become involved in
quibbiing over dirty cartoons
during a serious revolution. One
might argue that the sort of
"working classes” the Hero-
dactyi is seeking to attract will
be drawn to such stuff; but
from my own observation many
blue-collar Workers are likely
to be conservative and puritani-
cal in their tastes, and I do not
think the radicals would be
wise to chance offending them
(in ii mere whim.

Now it is an entirely defensi-
ble position that the staff of
the “underground" newspaper
is not wise, that the cartoons
are indeed a whim, and that a
tactical blunder has been mader
But I prefer to give more credit
for cleverness than the editor:
perhaps deserve, for if is better

to overestimate men’s power»
than to underestimate them.

in his article entitled “The
Movement at Grinneil”, Richard
Schnairov explains the failure
of the Grinneil Student Move-
ment in the following way:

“The real issue was and still
is which side will the students
and faculty take. Will they line
up with the oppressed and ex-
ploited people in the country
and around the world or will
they line up with the oppressors
. . . We in the movement com-
pletely failed to pose the real
problem. We failed to polariza
the alfernau‘ves."

It is apparently true that on.
is either with the Movement or
against it. (My revolution, right
or wrong.) And one of the or-
deals of catching up with the
Movement seems to be an ac-
ceptance of the propriety of hav-
ing vulgar cartoons in its news-
paper. If one puts oneself on
the side of Mr. Schnoirov et. al.,
how can he avoid seeming to
approve of the tone of the
Plarodactyi? is he not involved
in an act of complicity in the
vulgarness?

Of course, any polarization of
alternatives forties people to
ignore distinctions and sacrifice
their reason for a particular
dogma; and perhaps in an ef-
fective revolution people must
give up their right to make in-
dividuai judgments about the
proper course of action and be-
come parts in the great liber-
ating machine. But do they havs
to make even such things as
taste, which have nothing to do
with the revolution per so, part
of their political commitment?

Is there here a faint scent of
the totalitarian tendency to con-

About 40 people Attended the Saturday "wedding" of Paul Jones and Janet Thomas on the lawn
of Conference House. “They felt their rnnr—rylng each other encompassed all of the friends of
each individual,“ says a friend who attended. The two exchanged rings, and performed a wed-
ding dance, in n ceremony they found more no eanlngfiu than their earlier one. Their friends
shared a wedding feast of wine, bread and cheek, Ind sat on the grass in the autumn sun.

BENJAMIN F. GRAHAM, Jr.

“Mr. Hoar Is Still in Concord,
attending to Botany, Ecology,
etc., with a view to making his
future residence in foreign
parts more truly profitable to
himr"

This comment, written 110
years ago in a letter from Ben-
ry David Thoreau to his cousin
in Bangor, Maine. reveals that
even then, long before the term
ecology had found its way into
the dictionary, Thoreau and at
least some of his contem-
porarles had discovered the
pleasures and increased sense
of gratiiication to be derived
from the ecological point of
view.

one's environment, and to real-

having been led to believe that

bearable in the summer and
unthinkable in the winters

It’s not flat. not are the sea-

True, you'll probably be able to
get along without unpacking
your crampons and pike, but
it's not flat. The pleasantly roll-
ing topography is the product
of more than 10,000 years or in
termittent rains which have
eroded deep into the land.

From the profiles of the deep
est cuts one can learn some-
thing of the gross physical
changes during the Ice Age,
and their role in building the
substrate on which we live.
Here in Grinnell, the bed-rock
is more than 200 feet below the

ducing some consequent change
in each of the others, is to find
at the same time the comfort
of humility and the wonder of
reality. It seems healthful to
discover that nothing one sees
in nature is static.

E v e r y molecule, organism
and population represents the
ephemeral sum ot subtle and
intricate environmental changes
which, having led through cons
to the present, will continue to
lead to the future. Any mole-
cille, organism, or population
which lacks the resiliency to
adapt to environmental change
is doomed to extinction.

i guess what I‘m trying to
say is that life is more inter-
esting, if you‘re aware or

lze that you’re a part of it.

If you stumble over a gran-

through one of the deeper ra<

chances are that it‘s a Chunk of

carried here by the glacial ice
as it moved down from the

blew in from the Missouri
River Valley during each of
the warm windy intecgiacial
periods.

The Ioess is Iowa’s great
agricultural sail, a priceless
heritage, but not present in
infinite supply. You‘ll see
tons of it, having been mis-
treated, moving over to Illi-
nois on our westerly winds
this winter.

To come back to the layer
cake analogy, ii we cut down
through the top two layers
along an eastrwest line just a
few miles north of Grinnell.
and then remove the top two
layers from the southern half
of the state, we Will have CnmA
pletcd a reasonable model of
the glacial stratigraphy of
Iowa

The oldest layer (Nebraskan)

lies on bedrock, the next (Kan-
san) overlies the oldest, and
Grinnell sits atop the ioess
which covers the Kansas glacial
debris. The top two layers
(most recent) did not quite
reach this far south. You need
drive north only a few miles,
however, before you go up over
a conspicuous rise and onto the
top of the cake.

When the contractors dug
down through 15 feet of loess
to put in the footings for Rob-
erts Theater, they found a thick
layer of peat. in it were the
well-preserved remains of an
ancient bog-forest — Wood,
bark, pollen grains and many
other clues.

When you walk beneath the
rtage in Roberts, you pass only
a foot above this soaking wet
compressed remnant of a larch-
spruce forest which thrived
here 24,000 years ago and may
even have witnessed the icy
edges of the two most recent
glaciers.

After two iairly poor sea.
Ions (both 2-6). most students
have predicted that we're in for
another bad year. Hints oi a
strange optimism can be seen
in those who know something
about this year’s team. Rumors
or a “new look" and “maybe
‘win hall" can be heard around
the “inner” circles.

The “new look” starts with
the two new coaches, Conney
Kilnbo from Indiana University
and Ray Boyd, tormerly head
Iootball coach from Grinnell
x-tigh School Coach Bowers,
who has proven his ability with
the right material, is still head
iootball coach.

With only nine returning let-
termen, part or the new look
will be the players themselves;
many members or the last
year’s undefeated freshman
team will hold starting posi-
tions this year. Steve Hutch<
ings shows potential as a line-
backer and Alex Karlin should
have a great year at delensive
tacklci Larry Grimm and Jim
Edwards are agile but big and
are likely to do a fine job at
the guard positionsi Roy Lewis
is out With an ankle injury, but
should soon he ready to play
again Roy's big, fast, and has
excellent moves.

The success oi the season.

however, will mainly depend on
the returning lettermen. Rumor
has it that the captains Bob
Lillis and Don Kraitsik have
sadistically hard workouts.

For those of us who love to
Watch hard hitting tullbacks,
Jon Buswell's backt Jon spent
last year in Costa Rica and he
should have a good year.

Bryan Barnes is lighting to
keep his position at haliback,
and from the way he is running,
he might hold it.

Don Kraitsilt will be the wing~
back, and he's another hard
hitting runner,

Doug Fink will be starting
quarterback, the only junior
letterman, Doug threw some
line passes last year, and could

The new look in oiiense is ru-
mored to be an “I” formation
with a permanent “up" and
“down" side.

The opener tomorrow against
St. olat should be a very tough
game. They only graduated
two starters and are picked to
win the Midwest Conference
this year. The iirst chance
most of us will have to see this
year’s team will be next Sat-
urday, the iirst home game,
when we meet our annual ri-
vals, Cornell, Be sure to make
that one, support the team and
see it you aren't surprised by
the “new look"—the beginning
or a good year for Grinnell ath—
letics (its about time”)

STUDENTS INVENT NEW COURSE

A new course is included in
this year's curriculum because
oi the eitorts of a group or stu<
dents. Philosophy 101, Seminar
in Ethical Discussion, was cre
ated as an experiment to serve
two iunctions: l) to provide a
course in Ethics based on the
students’ own assumptions and
interests rather than the history
of ethics, and 2) to reason out
a series of rundamentai ques-
tions tor group discussions in
the resident halls.

According to Grant Crandall
and Donald Stump, both '69,
Who initiated the idea of the
class, it was accepted by the
philosophy department and by
a general vote or the racuity
last spring with only minor
changes in the students' pro-
posal. The readings and weekly
schedule of topics for the two
credit seminar were worked out
with the instructors, Mr, Haas
and Mt: Worley.

The first eight weeks will be
spent in arguing philosophical
questions like the existence or
tree Will and the ultimate goal
or man. The remaining weeks
will be spent in applying the
distinctions made to problems
of current importance, such as
those posed by Black Power,

drug use, and premarital sex.
Students select their own reada
ings trom lists of short articles,
both ancient and modern, rep<
resenting major ethical sys-
tems. Forty students are par-
ticipating in the experiment and
about thirty more were closed
out, Haas said,

One pro-administration argu-

The team has largely im-

took Doug Dray, number one
runner last year, and Bob
Grant, the second runner. This
year’s team will sport a youth-
ful look with the top five run-

The top returning Veterans
are Bob Asbilie, number two

In September again, as
shown by our typical autumnal
deluges (Camelot this is not),
and we are again immersed
(what a clever verb choice) in
the pleasures and rigors of
l. M. football. The game is the
some and the people are the
same and yet, somehow, the
thrill is just not there. Dibble
no longer hates Smith and, aft-
or titty yearn oi tradition, who
can work up a good antagonism
against Haines Hall? Nonethe-
less, the show must go on, on
September 16th, the teams
marched (swam?) out to the
football wars.

The balance that has been
characteristic oi the other
years is somewhat lacking this
year as a result of the fact that
the 0ii»Campus team is made
up entirely at seniors while
most or the other North Ca'm-
pus halls have about ten seniors
in the entire hall. Loose has al-
most one hundred meu, more
than double most oi the other
halls, and yet the system
creaks on with no structural
changes.

As for my customary pre<
season picks (which have been
correct tor the last two years),
I feel I can say, without iear

oi contradiction, that the Oil-
Campus team will go undeleata
ed. The Dkies (clever?) heat

can only be described as ludi-

clear soiling from here on in.
Dibble should finish second and
from there on out your guess in
