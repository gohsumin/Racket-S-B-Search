' Gl’lllltell student union
Ed by March

is pictured allure.

Temporary union plans he yea/e ;
history of present building given

The latest in a long line of “temporary"
student unions at Grinnell wlll begin operation
on March it in the newly remodeled basement
of Main Hall, Merritt c, Ludwig (vice president)
annonuced today. Main basement will be the
campus social center pending completion in last
of the new Grinnell College Forum on which
constru 'on will start this spring. ‘

Activities in the old union building will be
dispersed to new locations by the end ot Febe
ruary Cyclone and 5&8 otfices will be moved

to 1022 Park SL: the food service office will
occupy remodeled space in Mears basement; the
oiiices of Georgia Dental (activities counselor).
the strident auditor, and social and SGA. com—
mittees will be moved to ARH. anne . and the
union grille and lounge will be moved to Main
basement

Most of the moving will take place during
the last week in February. “Although we will
try to keep the grille ope ting as long as pos-
siblc," Ludwig c id, “it. will probably be neces
sary to curtail, il not suspend, some activities in
the building that week,”

The college is contracting for removal ot the
old building during March. Dismantling will

probably start soon after March it.

The present building is the only real student
union building the college ever had. Ludwig said.
It is the suitcassor at several smaller social ce
tcrs once operating in such places as the “Y’
building (now Steiner Hall). the White House,
and the residence at 1206 Broad St., now the
home of John Kleinschmidt (modern foreign
language), Union operations in these locations
were pretty much limited to refreshments and
maybe some checkers and ping pong, Ludwig
commented.

Dismantled and hauled by truck some 235
miles from the Sioux City Air Base, the pres—
ent building was a war surplus structure given
to Grinnell by the government along with
several otlmr barracks buildings used to ac»
commodate the post—ww n student population.

The building was formally opened, complete
with ribbon—cutting, on Nov. 15'. 1947, Only
the first iloor was used ior socialepurposes;
classrooms and taculty oiticcs were on the see
ond floor.

In a student contest to name the building,
“Pioneer Pub” won out. but the name didn't
Stick. However, “Elbow Room.” the name given
to the back portion of tlic grille is still used by
some students and faculty.

At the grand opening of the union much at.
tention was given to a new popcorn machine,
and a unique donut making machine s 'd to turn
out up to 75 dozen dounts per hour.

“Everyone has always thought of the studentl

union as it ’ternpcrary' building,” Ludwig coin
mented. “Student generations since 1947 have
been telling visitors somewhat apologetically
that Grinnell is going to build a new social celle
ter soon, and no one expected the old bullding
to remain almost it: years’

Main Hall basement. the temporary ”union”
until September of 1964, has undergone major
remodeling: during the past 60 days. Tile former
little theater is converted to a large lounge area
with terrace A new outside entrance w s con-
structed at the northeast, and a new 211in r h to
the private dining room was provided.

The Whole area, including the private dining
room, is air condltionnd. New rest rooms and a
(oat storage roonl have also been Constlu ‘ted.

The former private dinlng room pantt'yrstor—
age space will become a temporary grille kitchen

wtih tlic picket”) counter just outside the PDR _

doors. Saga plans to offer the same rclreshment
menu. but soft drinks, candy, and cigarettes will
be rended by machine due to the cramped space
for counter ervice.

Furnishings from the present Union lounge
will be moved to the new lountze area, and rooms
adjoinlng the lounge will be used for television

and bumper Deal. The private dining room will'
he the grille seating area using the present FDR,

tcébles and chairs. Some booths will also be adde
e ,

The college expects to continue use of the prie
vate dining room for toreign language and othcr
group dining, Ludwig said. which means only
the lounge area and vending machine scrvicc
will be available during the noon and evening
meal hours most days.

Opening and closing hours and other details
concerning operation of the ncw union will be
annonuccd later.

‘Cagers defeat Cornell; to battle Carls, Oles’

The Rams took the floor with
an unusually well—balanced and
talented team, but they simply
couldn't cope with the fierce
Pioneer drive and determina-
tion. Three players scored in
double figures for the home
team Jim Mifflin drilled home
18 points, John Sundell pumped‘
in 14 points, and Car Smltlt ndd-‘
ed a ‘very important 13 points.

Although it was an excellent
game for the spectator who eiiaj
joys excitement, the game could
only be described by the gen.
eral play as erratic. At times
both teams appeared to be mak-
ing a conscious effort to throw,
the game away, and Conlelll
finally succeeded late in the
second half when their wllolei
offense collapsed. 1

Ed Truelson fouled out with
one minute and 33 seconds re
maining in the contest, and
Dick Calbow fouled out with‘
about one minute to go and this
practically immobilized the Ram

machine.

Freshmen beaten by Cornell 71-66;
edge Central in three overtimes

By Neil Weiiier
8&3 Sports Writer

The freshman basketball team
ended their season this week
with two games, one against
Cornell and the other against
Central, lt lost to Cornell Sat.
urday afternoon in Darby gym
and beat Central in the same
place Tuesday evening.

The Pioneers had three men
in double figures including
Cord Kinkead with 22 and chf
Frantz with 20 but their defense
they allowed
five Cornell players to score
ten or better. The final score
was Grinnell so, Cornell 71,

The Central game was a dire
ferent story, The Pioneer flee
fensc, which has been hurting
all season, finally began
click and this, combined with
excellent shooting, sent the
Crinncll frosh to an
point lead. The second
played the last five minutes of
the first half and the half time
buzzer sounded with Crinncll
ahead 38-29.

Coach Bowers switched his
team to a maneloemftn defense
in the second half but it did
not seem as effective as Central
closed the gap about halfway
through the second period From
this point on the score stayed
close and thc lead changed
hands several times. The second
half ended in a tie and it look
three overtimes to decide a i-ic—

According to Coach Bowers
the biggest problem of the team
all season has been its weakl
defense. They have allowed the‘
opposition to score too many
easy baskets, Bowers said "The
difference between good teams
and mediocre teams is the dc.

cause of our defense." He thinks
that Frantz and Kinkead will
make valuable contributions to

It was not until about 1366 that two students, Charles

a physical tr ning program, At the start it consisted of
two things: a collection was taken for :1 swing to be hung‘

At the age of so, when many
men e slowing down in their
aciiy ties and beginning to look
toward retirement, Albert Craft,
0[ 1526 Spencer St., is putting
in a full 70-hour week and .seotrs1
at the idea of cutting don-n. Aft-
er all, how can a man think at
retirement when he has just bee
gun a brand new way oi lite?

In 1954, alter 52 years oi~liiu
ing, working on. and owning‘
farms in Chester township, Grah‘
and his wiie decided to move in-
to Grinnell and leave their son,
Albert. Jr, to run the farm. in
order to l-zeep himseli busy and
provide a small supplemental me
come. heaccepted a light main-
tenance job at Grinnoll College.

Took Job In 1958

In the case oi multitudes oi
younger men, the call of tumors
tunity is met with a deaf ear.
When Al Graii, then as, was of-
iered an opportunity to work
long hours at a strenuous lob,
he jumped at it, In 1953 he as-
sumed his new position of col-
lege athletic equipment manag-
e .
"When I ﬁrst started at the
college I had only planned to
do a little light carpenter work,”
he said, “I never dreamed that
I would end up in charge of the
athletic equipment. Now that i
have the job though, I wouldn‘t
trade with anyone."

Graﬂ‘s office is a 10 by 10 ft.
cubicle at one end of the men’s,
locker room in Darby gym. Dur~
ing the school year it resembles
a cluttered antique shop. ‘

Uniforms of all descl‘ (ions
and sizes hang Irom the Ceiling.
A huge table, which takes up
tho-thirds of the ﬂoor space in
the odice, is heaped high with
equipment ranging from broken
football helmets to unstrung ten»
nis racquets. Under (his tsble
and overﬂowing into the illrdee
ﬁned aisles around it is an in-
describable pile of various ath-
letic sundries which have been‘
collected and dumped there over
the years.

The walls of the “Cage," as it'
is reier d to, are ringed wlIh
ceiling high cabinets ehocked
full of everything from seeks to
shotguns.

Buried in one corner- of this
crowded cage is a heat up old
desk barely discernablc under a
