8:45 —— Arrival at Grinnell
College. Intention was to take a
pig out to lake and slaughter it.
Driver had 9 o’clock class. He
took keys of car with him to
class. Meanwhile B846 men are
unloading chairs into Langan
basement for lounge party that
night. A B&G man nlused how
he recalled that a pig was once
slaughtered in a men’s hall a
few years back. It takes a long
time to roast a pig. The keys
to the trunk were in class. Lan-
gan basement shower is a clean,
tiled, sunken affair, The site
of the death was fixed. 'lhe
tools were moved into place:
a stout machete, razor sharp;
one 4'lncll Switchblade; and 4

squeals. Mr. Pomerenk called

RADIO TURNED OFF

Members of the executive board of the fetal radio station re-
signed en masse last week

Following the example of station manager Babak Armajahl,
they dated their resignations January 3. They Will withdraw
them, though, if the station is operating by that date.

At an open Senate meeting Tuesday, Atmajani explained that
the board members are frustrated, and cannot continue to work
without results. They hope to coerce the college administration
into getting something done.

The pressure seems to be taking effect. Armajani says so
much has been accomplished this week “it would make your head
spin.”

Evan Walden promises that the station's studios will be
completed by December 18, but, notes Armajani, “I won't be com
pletely optimistic until we're on the air."

Reviewing the history of the station, Armajani said the idea
of reviving the radio station was germinated about two and a half
years ago. There had been a station on campus some years before.
The college administration was cool to the idea, even alter the
Student Government Association agreed to ﬁnance it.

A group of students then formed the organization of the station
and submitted a detailed plan with a budget included, to the ad-
ministration. The administration was then willing to commit itself
to the idea. The executive board hoped to have the station on the
air at the beginning of this semesterr

Since then, Armajani said, the station’s studios have been lo-
cated in just about every building on campus, and after seven
months the station is still not on the air.

The station‘s staff at its peak included one-tenth of the student
body, Armajani told the meeting. They were very active in train-
ing and discussion sessions at ﬁrst, but are now demoralized.
They do not feel that they are accomplishing anything.

Armajani still has hope that the station will be broadcasting
by January 3 and that it will not be engulfed in a “bureaucratic
quagmire," If the station is not on the air by January 3 and the
board resigns, Armajani expects to reorganize the board when
and if the studios are completed.

“Too much has been done by too many people to let the thing
die on paper,” he said.

Concern was voiced by Iowa

Metzler did not want the is-

A RADICAL EXPERlMENT
lN GRlNNElL GOVERNMENT

'Aiter only three meetings an efficient and conscientious
Senate constitutional reform committee has drafted a preliminary
proposal to alter radically Gl'inneli’s student government into the
most progressive student democracy ever attempted by a college
or university in the United States.

The proposal would change the large and cumbersome suiclent
Government Association (SGA), with its Council of House Presi«
dents (Coil-lP), Associated Women Students Board (AWS), and
Senate, into a unified Committee of Thirteen, employing a stream.
lined system whereby any student can recommend legislation, seek
redress from administrative oversight, and understand all of the
workings of the student government and administration policies.

Ten of the members of the Committee of Thirteen would be
elected atelarge from the student body, under the proposed plan.
Anyone, including ireshmen, who meet academic eligibility re-
quirements, could seek election. The AWS and Coil-1P will be re-
tained solely in an enforcement and advisory status in the halls,
but the Coil-KP and AWS presidents would serve as voting members
of the Committee of Thirteen. A Chairman of the Committee —
like the present SGA president — would conduct meetings and
have a vote. The social coordinator will act as an ex—officio non-
voting member.

Standing committees on all phases of student life —— eg., li-
brary committee, rendence hall committee — will feed proposals
into the Committee of Thirteen for action, The chairmen will be
lelectecl by the Committee of Thirteen (Corr) from people who
make applications, and all interested students may apply to the
chairmen to serve on these committees. The standing committees
will meet regularly, and regularly propose legislation to the Ccrl'.

Underlying the entire structure, an office of student ombuds-
man will be created. The ombudsman idea originated in Scandi-
navian countries as a people’s watchdog or official to investigate
grievances against administrative agencies’ oversights; his job in
Sweden, for example, was to protect the little man from the large
bureaucracy and to explain its policies and rationale.

The ombudsman — elected irom applicants to the Cofl' — will
have an office and regular hours and would receive a salary equiv-
alent to that of the present speaker of the Senate. A student who
feels that he has a valid legislative proposition seeks out the om-
busman to find out which committee would be the proper channel
for it.

A student Wishing to deviate somewhat from the academic
requirements of the college because ol 8 special situation asks
the ombudsman where to turn in the College administration. A stu—
dent indictetl by the judicial council can ask the ombudsman how
best to be assured of his rights.

The ombudsman would meet weekly with the deans, and would
sit on the ColT as a non-voting observer. He would receive min
utes from all of the standing committees and hopefully have access
to minutes of faculty committees dealing widi student life, al-
though the contents of the latter would not be publicly divulged.

The ombudsman would report to the Con". His power lies in
the prestige oi his office, and the investigatory publicity (sets, ra-
dio station, etc.) attending his reports.

In short, anyone can go to the ombudsman, and find out how
his government works and is working. Any student can play a part
in the representative government on a committee. Any student
can run for an office. Any student can propose legislation. All stu-
dents will have a voice in the smoothrrunning democratic process.

Ombudsmen . type proposals have been offered in several
state legislatures and many congressmen have agreed that this
approach to democracy works well with populations oi one or two
thousand. Colorado, Pennsylvania, lowa, New York, and several
other states, have dmfted ombudsmen bills.

One or two American colleges have considered a government
employing an ombudsman, but they were lost in struggles for
other reforms. If the Grinnell student body and the Senate have
the courage to create a government like the one proposed by the
Senate constitutional reform committee it will be a First.

A student govcmment can be more than a mirror image of
American political process; it can he an experiment in progressive
sziciency. It can put Grinnell on the map.

We hope that the trivial difficulties in passing any revision of a
governmental system are transcended with all the celerity of a
thinking student government.

The Senate cornmittee on constitutional reform is to be cork
maimed tor its rapidly evolved and wellvfounded proposal. This
is something that should be talked about and noted upon . . . soon,

The new Grinneil Plan lot Student Governments is good enough
not only to streamline Grimeil but to serve as a guideline for every
other college and university government in America,

ANIMAL BEllllhlﬂllR

By Ne FschEI‘,

There seems to be nothing to complain about at Grinnell this
week, but something is radical (and therelore interesting) in the
state of Denmark.

Tile independent republic of Bird Island —- located in the
middle of one or Copenhagen’s several city lakes _ has de-
clared total war on the United States.

According to reports irom the British News Service, the newly-
proclaimed republic was founded last month by Danish students
representing an organization called Zenith.

The ultimate goal of Zenith is not known.

Danish police on the banks of Lake Sortedamsseoon were
“making invasion plans" November 9, according to a Collegiate
Press Service (CPS) release, as the students refused to surrender
their lztldsquareyard nation.

Bird Island has a population of six. It was seven, but one D!
the iouiideis apparently ieu overboard from a landing cralt and
had to swim back to the Copenhagen shore.

“The group has sent a telegram to the United Nations seeking
membership," the CPS reported, “and a cable to the US Em-
bassy here (that is, Copenhagen) declaring total war.”

The Bird Island War — unlike the Vietnam conflict »— is al<
ready picking up open support of American college students, espe<
Cially in the Associated Colleges of the Midwest,

An editorial in the November 9 Beloit (Wisconsin) Round Table,
for example, proclaimed "SUPPORT OUR BOYS 0N BIRD lS‘
LANDl!"

“Join the new Peace Group on the Beloit College Campus,"
a news story in the Round Table suggested. “We are foresightedly
protesting the War in Bird Island."

"We oppose the Administration's stand on the isme," it cork
tinned, “They are choosing to ignore it although this one 15 a de‘
clared war."

“We have been challenged this time," the Beioit story Con<
eluded, “We want to iighfill”

Now I suppose I could relate the Bird Island affair to the
Grilulell campus. i suppose I could beiahor it in typical GSM <
The Paper—Mariotype satire. I suppose X could suggest a Saga
last to give out to Bird islanders or u Mobilization Against the
War in Bird Island or a Bird Island Committee.

1 could ask you all to get in the groove and consider off-cam-
pus, national and international affairs.

I ought to, really, because when I attempt to analyze onrcam<
pus, irritating problems, I get nothing but sweat.

You tell me I should be more concerned with off—campus, na<
tional problems,

You tell me I shouldn’t attack individuals who have been irre<
sponsible.

You tell me —— in letters — not to “waste space in public
bulletins."

Okay, kiddies, this week you just get what you tell me you
want — a typical news-type release from the phantasmagoric,
netherworld of GSMs everywhere. It’s real, documented news,
you know; it‘s really real. 1 hope you enjoy it as much as
you’re supposed to enjoy The Paper.

But really, you know, there are other things to talk about at
Grinneli — like the gross conservatism of the place, as a little ex«
ample. the conservatism that underlays GSM thinking and GSM
lack of action.

And if you'd like me to talk about that kind of thing again.
you know where to ask.

But if we don’t. want to reform the little irritations at Grin-
neii H if you really don't — l’li be happy to give up and let The
Paper tell you about other Bird Islandsr

IIII IMMODEST PROPOSAL

By DON WINNEY

Author's note: Any sexual or otherwise scintillating sym-
bolism herein stated, whether intended or distended, ex«
tended or attended is hereby declared slmply symbolism,
unless otherwise perverted.

Not long ago our esteemed President declared there is a Resl~
dential Hall Problem, not to be confused with last year‘s South
Campus Problem or the previous year's North Campus Problem,
He asked for a frank Solution and now, Irl all immodesty, I should
llke to propose a very natural one. But first, perhaps an existential
example from my tnil at Grinnell will help one candidly conceptu-
alize this humble answer.

A couple years ago one spring rlot night after diligently wres<
ding with the social implications of my gradepoint, I was calmly
contemplating realities of existence in a North Campus lavatory.
There, surrounded by cool green walls, lulled by a sweet, seques-
tered quietiide occasionally rippled by the sibilaut suddenness ol
sloshing water, I gargled transfixed by the Very pastoral sanctity
of this haven, reminded as indeed William Wordsworth was of
nature's welcome refreshment.

"Five times," I murmured to the rythmic rain of cleansing
water, “Five long times have I passed to thee this day. And again
I hear these waters swelling from their natural spring i .

“Pooh, you 5.0.3., you," I heard a friend politely posit. I ma
quiesced to that affectionate euphemism, although no one before
had ever called me “Pooh."

“Pooh," he implored, “This bitch has to take a ———”

“cognizance of our facilities?" 1 suggested. He was referring
to the sleepy, curvacious bundle of silken beauty seductively nes-
tled in his virile arms. “Why certainly," l replied, although dutl<
fully noting its gender, one usually foreign to our North Campus
facilities.

He gently dropped her on the floor along with several cans
of roaming liquid and staggered to the mirror where he wrote in
lipstick some obscure classical word, it looked like a derivative
form of the Latin Verb “iucco, fuccere,”

“Come on, Pooh," he begged in a somewhat unscholarly man-
ner, “Let's leave this bitch and go rape South Campus."

Why what did he mean? Never before had I been proffered
such a philosophical proposition. After all. it might be easy to do
that kind of thing to a bitch. But tn a universal . , . Suddenly I
seemed confronted with a moral dilemma of enormous propor-
tion, one unequal to my mental or physical fortitude. Should l fol-
low my friend‘s sinuous and sinful path to South Campus like an
animal or should I remain here amidst the amenities of Civilizav
tion? That was the question: To go or not to go?

I had to go. Quickly I walked over to the lacility, Just then,
however, this bitch started tervently clawing at my leg. I looked
down and as i did. as 1 gazed upon those sultry lips, upon that
silken skin and sensuous body, upon that wagging tail, it was as
if the burdens of Civilization were somehow to be discharged, as
if face to face we stood naked unto the world unashamed oi out
corporal beings and now awed with a transcendental sense at hu-
man bretherhnod. l quickly pulled up my pajamas.

As my uncouth friend impatiently left, I graciously held the
door or the faculty open while she soampercd in. Yet I too was
relieved. At last there was a solution to the Residential Hall Proh-
lem a a civilizing emission at the human condition: coeducational
johns.

DEFENSE PLANNED AS
INVADERS RETURN

 

Again alter legal visiting
hours, though this week on Fri-
day night. six strange young
men found their Way into Read,
Loose. and Meats dormitories,

They went first to Read, en—
tering by the loggia door and
passing a Read girl who had
witnessed the invasion of Sat-
urday the eleventh.

She said: “At least one of
them was the same; he was a
big guy and easily recogniz<
able. One wore a jacket turned
inside out, but it flapped open
and showed a William Penn
College insignia," and added,
"They were drunker this time.”

One man entered a second

. floor room but left when told
by the surprised girl that she
was going to call the police.

The SIX then went (0 Loose
lounge where Bette Davis, Res-
Idellt Adviser, prevented them
from entering actual bedrooms.
She phoned the police, was told
about the Road call, gave dlr
recllOllS In the dormitories and
went to Main to look for the

patrol car already en route to
South Campus.

Their last Visit was to Mears.

“About 12:15 a.m. I went to
my mom; i opened the door.
A guy was sitting inside on the
windowsill, using my tele-
phone," a Mears girl said.

The window, which had no
look, was open, revealing the
boy's friends who were waiting
outside on the ﬁre escape. The
loose window screen had been
torn off.

“I asked him What he was
doing and he asked to make a
‘phone call," she continued, “I
told him he couldn’t, pried his
ﬁngers from the phone, and
pushed him out the Window, onto
the fire escape.

They ran to their car which.
she said, was a red Chevy
Convertible with a white top

The police, although they have
not caught the offenders, re<
portedly told the nightwatch-
man that the boys were from

BOOK REVIEW

ON NELLY SACHS,
HER POETRY

By GEORGE YOUNG,
RUSSIAN

The first German-English edi-
tlon of the collected poems of
Nelly Sachs (0 The Chimneys,

published last month by Far-
rat, Strauss, and Girou) is a
book of very important poems,

Hans Magnus Enzensberger,
in his introduction to the book.
calls the oeuvre of Nelly Sacha
great and mysterious, two
words which are among the
first we teach freshmen to
avoid when writing about liter-
ature. But Enzensberger use!
the right words,

Her poetry is great because
in poem after poem Nelly
Sachs iinds human voice and
human words adequate to speak
of the inhuman and unspeak-
able agony of the death camps.

Her poetry is mysterious be-
cause her words, her Voice, her
images quietly, without forcing
or fudging, transmute real
Bgunles into real joys. in her
poems the dust that rises from
the death furnaces becomes, by
magic that is not slight-of—hand,
the dust the butterlly carries
on his wings. The dust from
Dachau is carried, by winds
which man can not control,
across seas to become the soil
of Israel.

The themes here are the old,
timeless ones: death and re-
birth, catastrophe and redemp<
tinn. But what is fresh and

Nelly Sachs speaks of these

One certain problem for ev-
eryone today. but especially tor
the literary artist, is that daily
one witnesses and learns more
of the unspeakable, but one has
only words. Nelly Sachs fled
from Germany to Sweden in
1940, when, as she said, lan-
guage was all she had left. Not
many writers in any language
can lind words that say more
than a picture of a pile of emar
ciated bodies, or Words that
speak more eloquently than the
seven digit number of the
people wllo were killed. Only
the rare Word \leI not bounce
back, only the rare voice will
not scream or fail. Moreover,
the news media show us so
much of the unspeakable so
Often that our ears no longer
hear, say, the weekly boxscores
from Vietnam; our eyes no
longer see that humans, not
just televised objects, are be-
ing killed. For sanity we make
ourselves blind, deaf, dumb.

The achievement of Nelly
Sachs is that she gives us eyes

IIEIIN PATROL ROOMER RUMOR

Uncommon to popular belief,
up student has yet been tound
in violation of residence hall
regulations, Dean Thompson
said. Asked about patrolling, he
said that there has not been any
since the Spring Riot last year.
and he does not plan any in
the near future; he has no
plans for, as he puts it, “wane
dering around looking for trou-
ble." Thompson does, however,
reserve the right to intervene

if informed specifically of any
trouble.

Thompson said that house
councils, consisting of elected
officials, seemed to give pri-
mary loyalty to their constitu-
ents than to the administration
in conflicts that arise between
the two. A “civil service sys-
tern," he stated, might there
fore be preferable. The South
Campus ”batilehoard system"
was commended by Dean
Thompson as one such example.

of induction notices to overseas

GROSSETT’S GLOSSARY OF STUDENT “SAGE

By JOHN cnosserr,
CLASSICS

‘ Students have expressed, late-
iy. an increasing interest in a
course in “human values.” if
Iuch a course should material-
ize (spiritualize), a number of
curious problems would arise
As one student remarked to
me, “What will happen to a
student who fails the course‘i’,
,Will he iorieit his right [0 be
considered hum an" other
Questions follow; for example,
would he forfeit his right to
stay in crinnell-perhaps a
,Worsc fate. And what will we do
with those who get a grade of
"D” Would you want a room-
mate, or a house president, who
gut a “D" in “human values."
Even the “Credit-Fail" system
will not help here.

One reason advanced in sup«
port for such a course is thisll
there is a failure in ”Com-
munication". The words we use
may be the same but the mean-
ings are different; or worse
-—the words are different but
the meanings are the same, only
we cannot tell. In the interests
oi greater harmony, and to
help those working to establish
a course in “human values",
I have compiled the following
glossary for meanings attached
by students to the basic comw
mon Words of academic dis-
course. it is, of course, intended
only tor the use of faculty and
administration, since students
always have a clear and pre-
cise sense at what they mean
even when they iail to com-
municate the meaning. i
thought, however, that i would
publish it instead of circulat-
ing privately. in this manner,
niudents who resent being left
out of major “policy decisions”
might feel less resentful: and
——futhermore—as i may have
mistaken a meaning or two

along the way. the student body

will have a chance to correct

me. i shall be gratotul for any
additions or corrections

YEARBOOK
PLANS

As a result of previous dif-
ficulty with Grinnell yearbooks,
an experiment in yearbook phil-
osophy is now being carried out
on campus. The academic year
19674968 will see two yearbooks
instead of just one

Scheduled to appear on cam
pus in February, the first of
those books, Cyclone is“, will
have faculty and administration
pictures, senior pictures, and
hail pictures, which should make
it of special interest to seniors.
Grinnell Book 1958 will be a
candid View of the multiple fac-
eis of life at Grinnell, This
last journal, to be published
in June, is for every student
a valuable record of the events
of a college year. The Cyclone
is now selling for 33.50, the
Grinlieli Book for $4.50, or both
books for $7.00.

Since work on the Cyclone
is now being completed. sever-
al final tasks must be ac-
complished. Senior pictures will
be taken by the National Stu-
dios of Waterloo on Wednesday
and Thursday, November 29 and
30. A sitting fee of $5.00 will
be asked to cover photography
costs and postage charges on
the final color proofs.

Arrangements for appoint~
merits should be made im-
mediately by contacting Peggy
Morrison at ext. 514 or by sign-
ing the appointment list in the
Publications Room of the Forum.
Seniors who do not make their
own arrangements with the

RESISTANCE PAN-EL PLANNED

By RON W001)

As the second nationallyor-
ganized day of anti—draft demons
strations and resistance ap<
preaches, now seems a good
time to examine alternatives.
1 have asked representatives of
different organizations to come
to Grinneli December 1 to air
the issues.

Steve Morris, a member of
the Iowa City Draft Resistance
Union, (DRU), has agreed to
come representing that organi-
zation. An Air Force veteran.
he was one of three Iowans
to surrender his draft Card to
Federal authorities on October
16.

The position of the Draft Re»
slstance Union is best stated

by a quotation from one or
their handbills:

“The Resistance Is a move
ment of draft ago men who
are opposed to the war in
Vietnam Ind the policies til
the U.S. throughout the Third
World. We are saying that
our dissent and protest has
been ignored. We on saying
that mere dissent and pro-
Iest are no longer enough.
We call on all Americans to
refuse to light this war and
to resist the draft. . . Turn
in your card or join our sup-
port demonstration.”

Randy Miller, a senior history
major at the University of Iowa,
will represent Students for a
Dcmocralic Society (5135). This
organization, which has not
sponsored any national mobili-
zation since the first of the
demonstrations, is a radical
left group. I think its position
should be heard by anyone can-
templatirlg activism.

of biochemistry at low: State
University and editor of the
Iowa Peace Bulletin, will rep-
resent the Iowa Political Action

Lounge—is an allrlowa, student
and adult organization attempt-
ing to take the peace issue
into every state precinct and
to raise support in both major
parties for peace platforms and
candidates. it includes “old
line” peace workers at well as
potential candidates.

I finally approached mem-
bers of the Iowa Civil Libertieil
Union (ICLU) and have been
assured that a member of the
Executive Board will be pres-
ent here on Dec. 1. He
will speak on the legal and
libertarian aspects oi the var-
ious forms of war protest. They
(the ICLU) need no introduction
as defenders of individual civil
liberties and the democrsno
process.

The Iowa board will have two
cases before the U.S. Supreme
Court this year, one of which
is the Des Moines armband
issue—a political protest in pub-
lic schools where students wear-
ing protest armbands found
themselves in trouble with
school administrators.

Those undecided about the
form of their participation in
practical protests will, hopefully
find the air cleared by thls
discussion; PPFE pays for the
coffee.

A STUDENT OPINION

ANONYMOUS STUDENT
ANSWERED

By CONCERNED BLACK STUDENTS

There is indeed an increasing concern among Negroes on this
campus with the Negro subculture, but it is a concern that is ap«
parently little understood by the white students here.

A sociological survey taken last semester indicates that only
43% of the Negroes' primary group relations are with other Ne-
gmesl This moans that the majority oi these relations (57%) are
found in interaction with white students. We are not really aware
of any groups of Negro students that "eat together. walk together.
talk together, dance together, and generally spend time together
exclusively." .

We feel further, that the reasons you give for the Increased
numbers of Negroes on the Grinnell campus are all but totally er-
roneous. The increasing number of Negroes on this campus has
resulted, in most cases, from the active “recruiting" program of
the college. Regrciiully, the National movement of which you
speak involves a minorlty of American Negroes, and very few, if
any, of the Negroes on this campus. The isolation of a small, white
liberal arts college prevents their participation in this movement
on the level that other Negro college students have entered it.

All of this, combined with the apparent purpose of a “liberal”
education to indoctrinate the intelligent Negro into the White so‘
cieiy, has indeed caused a situation worthy of much concern. For
the Negroes on this campus, are, contrary to what you seem to
believe, painfully lacking in the really important elements of the
American Negro subculture,

The chalky, Sterile Grinnell environment forces the Negro to
relinquish his subcultural ties. He accepts the artificial standards
of the artificial college community in order to survive, in order to
be accepted. But the real crime is that in relinquishing the “old
values," The Grinnell Negro is also asked to relinquish his own
heritage: a heritage he should exhibit with pride, not store away
with his travel luggage.

The ”exclusion of the white world” is not the evil form of dis-
crimination that you describe, The ”self isolation” that you speak
of is imperative to the Negroes' search for an ethnic “soul.” This
inrgroup interaction is a necessity for the Negro if he is to main-
taiu his identity in a world which tries to destroy it. in direct con—
tradiction to what you have said, there is not enough of the Negro
Subculture on this campus, a subculture that actively works to
build the Negro’s pride in himselfl Ethnic pride does not mean so<
clal separation; ethnic apathy can mean social annihilation.

Today the American Negro seeks himsell; we here at Grinnell
are not. too late to start looking.

billion. The money presently
going to health, Education and
Welfare, he cited, only one
tenth of the military expenses,
§8.6 billion. At least $31 billion
of the military expense, he
said, was going to the war in
Vietnam.

This amount of money "could
provide all the state needs, in—
stea ," Hoover said. it could
also replace one million hous-
ing units, Think oi the jobs oi
those in the military, tor this
(employment), instead.”

Hoover ielt that the Republi-
cans must "push (or a new
lace, unite the factions," and
rally support so that neither
Johnson nor a prowar Repulr
iican is elected in 1968.

William Plymat, object of a
"Draft Plymat for Senate Draft
Committee" campaign, also ad-
dressed the group. An insur-
ance executive by occupation,
Plymat said that he has been
active in the Civil Rights move«
ment, and has also helped in
the iormation at a bill keeping
gambling and alcohol out of
Iowa.

He later added that even a
major number of hawkish
preachers might vote for him
because of his ‘gambling—booze'
issue.

Although the major empha-
sis is, of course, on the ap-
proaching presidential election
in 1968, Plymat said that “we
must not lose all interest in the
senatorial races. The only pre-
occupation now seems to be
with the Presidency. it is as
though we are electing a [our-
year dictator."

Asked about his prospective
candidacy, Plymat said: “1
ieel like taking a reading or
this group — would you sup-
port me? I am not anxious to
do it (run for Senator) unless
in my careful judgment it is
wonh it. . . . It would not be
good for the peace movement
(it I would just) divert votes
born the other two (candi-
dates)."

Plymat stated the opinions
oi some toward his running as
merely to “divide the anti-
iiichenlooper (present Senator)
iorces." He said that, if he did
run “there would be no pussy-
tooting around about it."

An analysis of relationships
between what goes on inside an
animal and what we see him
do may help to clarify our
knowledge of the variables con—
trolling behavior. George Zim<
mar (Psychology) is presently
doing research in this area.
Aversive (“painful") stlmu~
lation produces emotional be-
havior in men and other organ-
isms. One theory oi emotion
holds that some structures in
the brain (primarily those in

SCARLET AND BLACK

the limbic system and olfactory
brain) are involved in mediating
emotional behavior and learn
ing. Some stnictures inhibit
these types of responses, others
facilitate them. Zimmal‘ is pl'i<
marily interested in electrically
and chemically Stimulating the
brain and observing changes
produced in learned emotional
behavior.

Acetylcholine, a chemical
iound at nerve synapses, also
serves as a transmitter Sub-
stance in the brain itself. What
will happen to learned emotional
behavior ii the “emotional”
structures are Stimulated with
acetylcholine?

Memory traces are thought
to be changes in the nervous

system associated with learning.
In some cases, acetylcholine
may facilitate the formation of
these memory traces, in other
structures acetylcholine inhibits
memory traces. Facilitation and
inhibition are iniel‘l’ed through
observable changes in learned
emotional behavior Sll'lCe recent
research in men and other
animals indicates that StruC<
tures mediating emotion and
memory are closely related.
Zilnmal"s procedure will enable
him to evaluate the efiect of
acetylcholine on the “short-term
memory” that may be involved
in this sort of behavior.
Research at a small liberal
arts college, says Zimmar, has
some limitations. The iacilities

are good, the students oiten
inspiring but Zimmar {eels the
lack of what he terms “pres
iessional consultation".

it he were, for example, to
study the effects of early brain
damage on primates (apes or
monkeys). Zimmar would need
to consult with other profes-
sionals about diseases in the
colony, brain histology (tissue
structure) and other problems
involved in doing research oi
this type.

At a large university, vetet‘.
inarians, histologists and tech-
nicians are readily available.
Nevertheless, Zimmar [eels the
importance of teaching students
outweighs the disadvantages of
research at Grinnelli

GRAY MATTER

By Bill Gray

Volleyball has taken over the center stage of l. M. activities
and while it is considered by many as a filler between football and
basketball (primarily those who lose), many others play it with
the vigor and intensity usually reserved for football. South, with
enthusiasm enough to bring down the walls of Jericho, has taken
a commanding lead. At the other end of the spectrum is Dibble
whose enthusiasm wouldn’t have much eliect on a house of cards.

The intro—college bowling league continues to roll along in un-
interrupted obscurity. The lead is now held jointly by the teams
captained by Rick Kuethe and Dave North, their records are
15-5. Senor Perri, who doubles as a Spanish professor when he is
not kegling, holds high game with a me Eill Gray has high series
with 564 and Tom Oppenheimer has the best average, 180.

though I don't think humanity is ready for this philosophical pro
tundity, to placate the masses i will make it public. “The purpose

144 penalty points to win the
117 mile rally.

The course, laid out by the
Grinnell College ROTC unit, led
through several towns in and
around Poweshiek County. The

object of the rally was to fol<
low the route, given by instruc-
tions that referred to road signs
and landmarks, in a prescribed
time. Penalty points were in-
curred tor being early or late
at the finish line, travelling
more than the required mile-
age, or failing to answer “fill-
in questions” dealing with road-
side signs and buildings (eg.,

opened its 1567—68 season Sun-
day with a 7-4 loss to a power-
ful Des Moines club.

Des Moines scored first, but
Grinnell's Mel Thompson even-
ed the contest with an unas‘
sisted goal. Des Moines then
