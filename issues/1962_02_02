FM 7

We call your attention to the article on the next page:
0 this issue which deals with the possible switch by cam—l
pus radio station KGRW from All to FM‘ broadcasting.

We entirely support such a change

Critiscism ol' ”KG” has rained l1ea1ily upon the shoul~1

(leis of station managels throughout its history. Among
the blasts are these: that it is often impossible to bring‘i
in programs because of electrical interference or because‘
'of mechanical failure at the station; that the station is an
expensive hangout fol iazz ai'ficiandoes 1vhose“cool” chatu
tel and Far out fare find few listeners;
on campus don't have time to listen to the radio anyhow.

A switch to PM would eliminate the first beef almorst en-
tirely Such a change would allow the station to broadcast
suonger signals 7 signals even strong enough to be pick-1
ezl up in the now “KG- less" Norrisses. l

According to Manager Porter, true high fidelity sound
could be transmitted within a 10-nlile radius. Such improv

ed quality and range would be an inducement to the cam-
pus musical and drama departments to present radio con»l
certs and plays ,¥ thus helping to widen the variety of
programs, a task already undertaken with some success by
Porter.

And, in answer to the third criticism, we think with
the good programming and fine mechanical quality which
17M would allow, more people would find time to listen.

Of course we re; ize that FM reception requires a dif-
ferent type of receiver than the traditional AM varietyl
But FM rcceivers are no more expensive than the othel
type. Many students have FM receivers now and are en-
joying the excellent commercial-free programs available onl
e tions in Des Moines and other cities.

e think the investments 7 $7500 (ma mum) by
tie college and individual investment ill FM 1eceive1's ’7‘
\zollld be well worth the money
And for those who don't wish to buy an FM set, we;
offer a suggestion made in our office the other day. Why
not present afternoons of selected music in Roberts Then-
ter? Piped through the wonderful sterophonic sound sys
tem recently installed there, such music would provide a
good background for, say, Saturday and Sunday afternoon
reading. ’

To the Editor.

The pieces in Volli
by Mr Schlh Mr, 111, Clyde
Douglass and Mr. Smuckel‘
have all impelled me to write
you about somelhmg which has
been worrying me since the late
Washington junket.

1 had always believed that a
college, when it was not a way
of lchcvlng the tedium or an
oppoltunity f6! amiable dlSS-pﬂ-
lion, or an apprenticeship for
making money and marriages,
\vas a place {01 thinking This
thinking wlll perhaps be often
muddle headed and hopelessly
inconsequential, but still, in 01.1-
ioles as students and faculty.
0U) business is to think, not to
act, and to think about "Ham-
let," Malx, 01 Plato not about
practlcal matters.

11 seems to me oncn proper
that a student resign from :1
college, temporarily or perman-
nenlly, 1n order to take up a
life of action. And it seems to
me occasionally proper, in pe-
riods cvcn gllmmel than these
that a college stop being: a
college and become n political
or minim-y arm.

last issue

But it 58121115 to nle always
necessary that a student, at
the times when he takes be
ing :1 student seriously, should
think—.instend of .vloing my-
thing else; and that a college,
insofar as it takes being a col-
lege seriously, should pm.
vhlc a place for lhlnklng.
May 1 quote George 1'. Ken-
nan. if only for the prestige

lof his name" “All the remaining

years of life will be available
for preoCcupation with the pass»
ing scene; but these years of
school and college are the only
ones available for history. for
literature, for an, un- lhought,
for philosophy.

“if the student gets these
things at college, there will al»

1ways be time in the years‘ ahead

to take part in the 111a vi the
day, and he will have the equip
ment to do it. But if he does
not get these things in his stu-
dent years, 11 is unlikely that he
will ever get them at all. . . 4
This is why 1 am irollbled
when 1 see students sitting
around—sometimes even under
the encouragement of their
teachers—attempting to discuss
,cun-cm international problems
which they slmply do not have
the historical and the geographr
1c and the semantic knowledge
to discuss in any useful way,

1 would like to canal

and

of religion. 1 don't cven want to
assess the strength oi the “Red

claims the existence of 2000
rightwing local organizations
and presumably 11-ch to weld
these clement: into :1 “Fratermty
cl Country-Savers" in a lop~sccV
be: policy session last month.

A less-persuasive Billy Jim
named Fred Schwaltz heads an
organization on the West coast
which also aims at puttmg religr

Both new records show what a little competition, hard
