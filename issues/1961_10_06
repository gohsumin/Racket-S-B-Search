High Court Clears North Younker;

Throws Out Vague 0W0" Bull? 7 1

Article Vii oi the men’s house
rules was declared unconstitu-
tional by members oi the High
Court lollowing nine hours spent
in deliberation after the appeal
oi the CofHP vs. North Yoiinkcr
case.

This section or the men's house
rules deals with the orientation
program, its obiectives and ice
strictions. it states that any vioe
latlon of the program, either
letter or in spirit, will be brought
before the men’s Primary Court,
and any person teeling that any
action taken violates the pro

visions of this program has the.

right to present his case to the
Corn? to allow this body to
pl’osecute.

The decision of the men's Pi
inory Court to iinc North Youne
kcr hall $20 ior violation o: Are
ticlc vtl, section B, of the men’s
house rules was also revcrscd
following Monday night's appeal
because of the unconstitutional
ruling given to the Article.

According to Justice Ronald

Den, the High Court agreed
upon two reasons ior the re—
versal. in the tirst place, the
general vagueness or Article
vll or the men’s house rules.
especially concerning a deﬁni-
tion or the “spirit" or the orien-
tation program, renders it im—
possible for the courts to guar—
antee due process oi law, that
is, “to insure justice to every
member or the Grinncll stu—
dent body." which is giiai-nn—
teed in the Bill or Rights.

The indefinite nature of the
Articlc leads to misunderstand»
ings concerning the nature or all»
iegcd Violations, which was evie
dent in the North Younker case
where both plaintiit and defendv
ant wcrc uncertain about specific

Violations

Secondly. Doi-i- says ,thc phrase
contained in Article Vii, Section
B, number 2, “to allow the Corn?
to prosecute," gives to the CorHF
the authority to establish itseli

The Best Monsters
Come In Small Packages

Every year about this time Grinnelliails begin acting
like Texans. They Illalle blueprints and architects drawings
and think BIG. They tall: about floats which don’t actual-
ly float but sprawl themselves massively over MacEachroll
:eltl during homecoming weekend for the admiration of
traditionalists and otller float-crazy people.

We wouldn‘t take issue with these big high school ideas
if they were ingenious, rather than just expensive, but the
eyes of the builders are generally larger than their col~

[ective budgets.

The allocated $40 allowance is hardly enough nowadays
'to sucessfully produce a walking, talking, smelling and eat»

jug float.

Because of the massive and complicated mechanical
nature of these monsters, melt creep out at night like
young grave llobbel's ill Search of parts for their Franken-
steins. These parts unfortunately are often found in the
holnesites or property of ollr neighbors, rather than ac-
quired from more legal sources

This sort of illegal acquisition goes a step beyond just
picking up a few nails at the last minute because there
isn’t time to get them elsewhere, This kind of acquisition,
“kiddies,” is becoming blgvtillle. It is known as stealing, and

.lt is definitely otlt of order . , .

not nice; it is altogether

naughty and one of these days the townspeople and the

,police may spank.

Therefore, we would suggest that you desist from il-
legal acquisition and the desire for building the larger mane
ster,'and start a trend toward more clever bllt smaller
lless expensive monsters, Forty dollars ought to be enough
,to build something you have to burn down the next day, if
you use your heads. The important thing to remember, it
seems, is that there is obviously a place where tradition
ends and grand larceny begins.

THE FORUM for DISSEN T

by Gilry Hanson,
Bill Johnson.
Mike Moutross

One of C, P. Snow‘s primary
contentions in his recent book.
“Science and Government," is
that a deplorable gap exi. s be
tween the scientist and the hue
pianist, According to Snow, the
scientist has become hopelessly
entangled in the confining prob-
lems of research; the historian.
the man of lcttcrs, the artist,
vicw science as a more or less
tattered field of study, oltcn ii»
relevant to the great human
problems (show was placing
special emphasis in the non-
scicntifically oriented govern
nicnt administrator).

‘ Snow’s essay deals with the
particular area of mcdcrn polie
tics, and lie intentionally sets
up the two vcry . opposing
groups, the scientist and thc poll.
urinn. But in today's intellectual
climate wc scc divisions opcn-
ing up between all areas of
knowlcdgc; our age is the age
of the Specialist.

In this problem of academics
Grinnell is an improvement ovA
or many schools. The Engli i
major is not entirely ignorant
of history and mathematics,
the language major is not on-
tirely ignorant of history and
mathematics and the music
major is not entirely ignorant
of psychology.

But our situation is not ideal.
Grinnell’s noble attempt to unily
the ’arens of concentration at the
freshmairsoplionicrc level with
the llumanitieshistorical studies
requiremcnt, the science and
foreign language requirements,

and tlic fine arts and philosophy
requirements i mildly effective
until such requirements are ful-
Iillcd. Then, however, the mean-
ing 01 a liberal arts education
is often forgoltcn, and each stu-
dent pursues his own limited
field of study.

One would assume that the
responsibility for the proper in-
lelloctual unification of the stu-
dent body would [all on the
faculty and that their example
would create an atmosphere con-
ducive to a meaningfully com-
plete, well-rounded education,
To a certain extent the faculty
crcatcs this otmosphcrc.

Intel -departmental comniunico
lien is relatively Well developed
on campus. The groups of pro—
fessors which we notice walking
together or sitting in the Union
together do not necessarily be-
long to the same department and
thus would not necessarily have
thc same academic cllannelings.
But the faculty's relationship
with the general student body is

far from ideal.

Several
complaining about
faculty participation Because of
a lack of articulate conscrvative
professors on Campus, the liberal
thinking which uiiitcs this fault
ty has gone stale and soft. Pro-
fessors no longer feel compelled
to win the students to their
point of View because they in
fact have no opposition to corn
tend with.

We need articulate conservar
tires on this faculty, if only
to sharpen and clarify the in-
tellectual liberars position for
the student body, and the in—

studcnt organizations
are

lack of '

tellectual conscrvntivc’s posi-

tion, for that matter.

Most deplorable, however, is
the miserable tactllty rcprcsen
tction at our many coffee hot 5
at a time when the prolessols
from all the different depart-
ments could get together with
the students on problems of
common interest. "This Slluws a
definite apathy and gives the
appearance of a very distasteful
sort of parcchialrsm. Bcar In
mind that whether the faculty
is really parochial or not is in]—
material if they give this il‘ne
pression to the student body.

If this type of faculty per-
formance continues, it will crip-
ple the morale of the school. If
a scientist can find no basis for
interest in literature, if a psy-
chologist cares nothing for the
problems of history, than the
title of Doctor of Philosophy be-
comes a complete misnomer.

It seems to me that the sep-
al'ationsybetween different areas
01 study within the student cure
I‘iculum must be corrected now
if Grinnell plans to maintain

its reputation as one of Anicr.
leading liberal arts colleges.
There are signs that these divb
sions in the student body are
narrowing. .

One might cxpecf that the fa-
culty would flock to meeting:
if only to Seize the opportunity
of uniting the college. But less
than six professors took the time
to attend the coffee hours last
week. May I remind all of Grim
hell that most of the problems
discussed at. a liberal arts school
are traditionally relevant to all
departments.

To the Editor:

Tlle talk about this iiow fresh—
man class being the best that has
cvcr assembled on the grounds
of Grillllell is somewhat appall-
ing to me. From my vantage
point, which is confined to
Cowles hall. I scc freshmen
exercising their newlound free-
dom and individualism at the
cxpcnsc of their classmates. They
want to become part of the hell
without participating in hall‘
functions; they want hall m’cm—
bersllip Without carning it.

Surely one comes to Grinncll
to study and to learn, but oiic‘s
education goes tllrtller than
book-learnin’. It is nicc to know
all about the Iliad and the
Odyssey, but it is also nicc to
know those with whom you lirc,

The freshmen of Crlnnell to-

day believe that they can do
wliutcvci- they wish without the
least consideration o[ the “pre-
sumptuous" uppcrclussmen, who
at least try to get them into tllc
swing of the Grinllell commu—
nity.

Although lhc restrictions on
hall membership have been
cast aside on the. thesis that
fresh are mature and responsi—
ble enough to contribute to
their hall. they have failcrl
to demonstrate these qualities.
They can comply and go
through a modified prepping
program, or they can abstalu,
as most of them do, Then they
want the Ilpperclnssmen to
make them feel part of the
group without cxcrc iig any
of their own i itiativo.

With this feeling prevailing in
the Il'eshmall class, as I see it.
nothing but the dormitory sys
tcm will collie into effect with
the passing of a few more years
The only thing left [or the “Old
Regime“ of upperclassmen is for
them to move into their own
"dorm" and let the all-knowing,
freshmen jolly-well carry on
their book-leornin'.

So uppel‘classmen, let us look
to South campus for our inspirar
tion and put all freshmen in the
Norriscs where they will bc one
unhcd class carrying on as they
damn wcll please without any
thing barring them from their
studios, In this way, I believe
that neither uppel'r or under-
classmen‘s feelings will bc hurt
by not participating in any
“dorm" activities.

To the Editor:

What. struck me in the eve-
ning debate was the complete
integrity of both speakers and
especially Mr. Lewis’ calm, [ac
tional defense of HUAC’s pur—
porlcdly slanderous activities.
However, the crucial attitude in
the auditorium was that of the
elderly lady sitting next to mc.

Discreditlng even Mr. Harring-
ton's statistics. shc evidenced by
a sporadic zeal her irrational
faith that at least one worthy
response to any American di-
lemma was an emotional antic
Communist stand, As Mr. Hon
rington pointcd out, though, in»
lelligenf answers can’t lie in
an eiitrcncliment or paralyzing
paranoiac response to the ad-
mittcdly perplexing problems
America is now facing (even my
home church is now contem<
plating a bomb shelter for their

next large project).

I would hope that democracy
is not now so intellectually
bankrupt as to be forced to
take up such a useless, disabl-
ing banner cs emotional anil-
Communism Amcricn is now
facing, I feel, a challenge to
stand on basic civil rights and
exercise a flcxrbilily of approach
to tlle world situation inherent

Senate Defeats
Election By Law

A constitutional bylaw whiclii:
would have changed the proce—

dure of electing class oﬁicers,vt *

avoiding some of the confusion
which was connected with the F
last freshman class election, .
was defeated at Wednesdayl‘
night’s Senate meeting.

CFlie by—law, which was made
by Main hall senator Sue Tay—
lor, was: “I move that the pro.
cedure for electing class oiri—
cers be as follows: Nominees
shall be those students subl‘n
ting an application to the out
going class piesident (or other'
poison designated by him) prior,’
to an all class nominating elec-
tion. The two candidates for
each onioc drawing the highest
number of votes on the nomi-l
nating election will be the nonNiel
inees for the ﬁnal election.
Sooner than 48 hours after tNhe‘
results ot the nominating elec<
tion are announced, the otricers
shall be elected by a inajo ty
of the votes cast in the norm-
nating election, he shall be due
clared elected at that time,”

The by_»law was deieated
chieily because many senators
telt that the whole issue of
class elections was too impor-
tant to issue single by-laws on

. Therefore, even as Miss Tay-l
lois b .1aw was voted down,
another motion made by her
was passed almost unaliimously.‘
This motion was: “that a come
mittee be created by the Speak—
er of the Senate to deﬁne the
position of class officers in SGA‘
and to present by—laws deter-
mining their duties. qualiﬁca—
tions, rights. privileges and the
procedure for their election."

The lay-law proposed liy Miss E

Taylor was the only motion
deieated during the entire—
Sonate meeting. others which
were passed were:

“That the Senate approve the
Executive Cabinet's appointment‘
of David Kennedy to the facul-

by John willianis

The M iootball season had
one or its more memorable days
‘estel'day with three games oi
varying signiﬁcance, From the
percentage standpoint, the big
game was Smit ’s [H] victory
over North, giving the former
undisputed possession of second
lace, their 3—0—1 record ’falllng
’ust short of Dibble's 3.0-0,

Gates rolled up the biggest
score or the season as they
Villtzed South, 464). Jim Jenlts
caught four touchdown passes

trom Cat Collier to pace Gates, _'

who won their third game
against a single loss.

The other game on the
schedule provided au interest—
ing rebuttal to those purists
who say that north campus
akes l‘M‘s too seriously. iRIlW‘
son defeated East 19.1, but
the score was only a minor
part of the story. »

.Rawson built up a 13—0 lead
in the ﬁrst half, then pulled
their ﬁrst. string and sent in
their celebrated “Chinese Ban-
dit” unit, which succeeded in
racking up a phenomenal nume
her of penalties, plus one spec-
tacular, if somewhat accidental,
touchdown, before being merci—

removed from combat.

only touchdown, inci-
'lentally, was scored against the
Rawson varsity, indicative of

something.

‘The football standings began
to take on a very surprising
appearance, with two teams, in
particular, resting in unaccus-
oined positions Clark, with a
i‘z—o win over Langan, climbed
into a tie with Rawson and
Gates for third place and show-
ed signs of causing some trouble
or the rest or the ﬁrst division.

Cowles was surprising in a‘
dinerent directionas they went
through another futile week,

Coach Dick Young felt that the
team gave a poor eifort in the
meet, He was satisiied only with
Thomson’s consistency and Nort
en's improvement.
llighlighting the meet were
the times turned in by two
frosh, raul Patterson and Rod

Brown, who grabbed the ﬁrst l

two places respectively. Pate
terson‘s winning time of 16:44

was 25 seconds faster than the l

winning (varsity) tinie.

Druce Beckord and Jeri Lang—
hom also ran well. Coach Young
was satisiicd with these tour
freshmen because this was their
first experience at the three milc
distance

Tomorrow Grinncll will run
against the Lawrence Vikings,
“They have the best potential or
any team in the colllel'cllce,”
said Coach Young, drawing on
the tact that they have their
whole squad returning They
have two boys who beat Tliome
son in the Conference meet last
year. it is doubtful, however,
that they will be in too good con-
dition this early in the season.
