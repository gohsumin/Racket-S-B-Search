“If we are all innocent, where does all this
evil come from?" Quentin asks in the Grinnell
College production of Arthur Miller’s “After the
Fall." Where indeed? For three hours the audi-
ence is questioned, preached at, raged at,
threatened, teased, cajuled and pummeled as
Mrr Miller tries to answer his own question. The
production is a failure, but more than half the
failure is Miller’s for having written a terribly
self-conscious, embarrassingly introspective play.

The first question is does one want to he the
target of a marathon monologue (punctuated with
flashrbaci-ts and tidrbit remembrances) ni Quen-

he will occasionally hit a target relative to each

doesn't. And this is the mammoth problem the
cast and director of the Grinnell production (or
any production) are confronted with.

All in all, they do surprisingly well, consider-

script. But even so, the final result is a kind oi

At its meeting Wednesday
night, the Senate discussed the
suggestions or a court-appointed
committee concerning the re-
vision oi the present judicial
system. The proposed changes
would involve the dissolution oi
the Faculty Committee on Stu-
dent Affairs and the student
courts, There would be instead
a judicial council consisting of
three students and three faculty
members and a faculty — stu-
dent ~ administration commit»
tee on policy evaluation and
recommendation would be in-
stalled.

According to Linda Neal,
chief magistrate oi the Women’s
Court, the proposed judicial
council would have jurisdiction
over all cases involving an in-
traciion or college regulations.
Secondary iunctions would be
those of a court oi appeals for
cases tried within the house
councils, and reviewing board
ior hall regulations

The Senate was iniormed that

these are only suggestions to be
worked upon in the following
weeks The iinal proposal must
he passed in nearly identical
term by both the Senate and
the taculty, as it involves n
change in both the student
constitution and the faculty or-
ganization. it appears that this
will not be so easily done.

Already, the basic problem
seems to be confusion, or at
least doubt, concerning the
council’s primary jurisdiction
over iniracted regulations. Ac-
cording to Miss Neal it is now
uncertain as to whether the
oouncii would serve in an ad
visory or decision-making ca-
pacity.

Joseph Wall, {acuity chair-
man, differing somewhat in his
interpretation, believes that a
recommendation would be sent
to the president only in cases
involving punishment. in the
event of an acquittal, the case
would be dismissed.

While this poll shows a significant positive response to the idea

who reply to such a questionnaire may be those who favor the
proposition in question. On the other hand, the overwhelmingly ai-
ilrmatwe response to this questionnaire and
the fact that the aiiirmative response in-
creases with each succeeding class are trends
which cannot be ignoled in any determination
of students' attitudes toward the environment
in which they live, or in which they would
like to live.

The ﬁgures show, whether they are wholly representative of
campus opinion or not, that at least 217 students would choose to
live in on campus apartments it they were readily available, This
is a sizable percentage in a student body at 1,150 and indi-
cates not only dissatisfaction with the present residence system,
but a positive response to an alternative system which is feasible.

SCARLET AND ILACK

 

On the New Court System -

A revision of the antiquated judicial structure at Grinnell is
imperative. Both the American Civil Liberties Union (1) and the
MUP (2) emphasize student freedoms and rights over disciplinary
proceedings of college or university administrators. The judicial
study group at Grinnell has been attempting to bring this college
out of the dark ages of dictatorial and secret procedure and into
the era of due process. Their proposal indicates they have gener-
Illy followed the important guidelines of the AAUP and ACLU.

Careful reading of their proposal, however, raises several
questions, two oi singular importance. in section 1 under “6. Re-
view" the proposal contains a “tacked on" statement giving the
president of the college the right to overrule the court not only
when he is appealed to by a student but also whenever he decides
to do so. President Leggett has stated that he might actually nverr
rule a court decision and impose a more stringent punishment.
This power is beyond the AAUP guidelines and jeopardizes every-
thing the Community Court stands for,

Secondly, the section on a separate policy-making body — al—
though good in concept —- is nebulous and wrongly organized as
stated What are its functions? We can only hypothesize that the
poli es set forth will have a great hearing on student life and will
determine the practices of the Community Court. if this is so why
is the committee dominated (a to a) by Administration and faculty?
It is plain to see that on matters where there is a fundamental dif-
ference of viewpoint, such as the separation of students from the
college for visitations violations, the administration-faculty wiu
continually overrule the student opinion. The result may easily be
worse than what we have now. Why not an equal voice on the
policy-making body for those most affected by its actions?

Those Locks on the Loggia—

The logic behind bureaucratic rationale has to do with some-
thing like "the stable maintenance of an institution," we suppose.
It is a peculiar kind of logic; slightly irrelevant to human con-
slderaiions.

Thus a college, building dormitories as a place in which stu—
dents may “live,” iinally views don'ns as a place in which students
are controlled. Proceeding from the premise of this twisted logic,
the college locks up its women students (in order to separate them
from the men at night) and, consequently, imprisons them within

a fire trap.

As if this is not enough, fire drills have been used as a further
means of periodically checking on the actual nightly presence of
women students in the dorm. Women students safely locked up
(away from the men on campus), the institution ceases to concern
itself with the welfare oi the men; lire drills are not planned ior
them.

The SKrB questioned the safety of Ihe locked dorms at Grin»
nell — wherein no allowance is made for free and unobstructed
egress so necessary during the panic state which often accompanies
n fire, A letter to the State Fire Marshal elicted a response with-
in a week stating the lowa Code “panic bar” requirement. it takes
out a week to find out if buildings are up to par, but Grinllell’s
Direclor of the Physical Plant, Evan H. Walden, (8&6) prefers a
policy of “wait and let them inspect us."

The “enlightened response” of bureaucratic minds to criticism
about Grinnell's inadequacies —— in this case, faulty fire safety pre-
tautions~is, as usual, one of defensive reaction. Walden maintains
that women students would be quite safe in the event of fire; they
may be locked in with the blaze but they could traverse the ioggia
a long way in either direction to escape or could jump through
ﬁrst ﬂoor windows. We tried to picture this blaze scene — smoke-
!illed loggia, hundreds of milling women (like a Sunday stroll?) —-—
but it escaped us.

Walden further argues that, indeed, the truly irrelevant think-
klg on this issue is in the minds of those who talk of savings lives
(to. by leaving the loggia unlocked) because the dorms are, in
fact, ﬁreproof. To this claim we would simply cite the example of
the recent conlllagration at “iireprooi McCormick Place conveerb
lion hall, Chicago. We would also cite the 1945 Haines Hall fire
which Walden seems to ignore. ‘

The college will probably take its allotted three months to
raise iire precautions at Grinnell to standard, thus timing the night—
time unlocking oi the loggia with the enactment of are “no hours
for women” proposal. Yet we cannot help but think that even bu-
reaucratic minds might be affected by the possibility of disaster in
the interim. Although human considerations may sometimes be
relegated to last place, college “image” considerations usually
are not.

Faculty Comment

“On The Need for More Crazy Peep e”

By George Young
(Russian)

in preparing this essay I have, naturally, en-
gaged in considerable consultation and research.
1 have opened many books, I have heard many
opinions on every topic, both pro and con, both
solicited and unsolicited, both at home, at work
and at play, and after weighing all the issues
carefully, after meditating long on the complexi-
ties, subtleties, and priorities involved, 1 have
arrived at the unavoidable conclusion that we
need more crazy people at Grinnellr

True, we have John Crossett, Mac 'Nelson,
Ezra Mendelsohn, Arieti, and others; but who
else do we have? We are, nearly to a man (or
woman) good, serious, responsible, conscientious
students, janitors, teachers, housemothers, and
administrators, and this is fine, very fine, excel-
lent if you will. But we need more crazy people.

For instance, with no minclng words, when
was the last time a bull fight was held on the

central quad? When

did we last have a win-

ning, or losing, blad-

derball team? When

did we last graduate an

outstanding poet, or

even give him credit
for writing poetry?

True, it could be ar-

' gued that students at

a liberal arts college

in a cornfield should

study, not fight bulls.
should lose at loot-
Mr‘ Young ball and basketball.
not bladderball, should criticize and cate-
gorize poetry, not write it, And it could be argued
that instead of bullfights, bladderball games, and
poets what we really need are more committees,
committees on committees, more reports, more
proposals to foundations, more money, more
buildings, more medals, and all the other essen—
tials of higher education, And my only answer
would be: yes, but we also need more crazy
people.

Our problem is that the kind of crazy people
we need more of either never come here in the
first place, or they come here and Sniff around
and leave, or they settle in and gradually quit
being crazy, or they keep thinking alld acting
crazy and finally we just have to send them off
to lowa City.

To say it differently, a great college can be
small, but regardless of size it should be large
enough to accommodate the exceptional. And
while we are a good college, yea, even a very
fine college. we will never become the college we
could he, never even become the college our
catalog says we are, unless, despite all we say
we have done and are doing, we do more, much
more, to accommodate, even encourage, the ex-
ceptional.

As it is, we are turning out any number of
Rhodes scholar types, but no Rhodes scholars;
any number of beatnik types, but no zeal beats;
any number of people who write poetry, but no
poets; any number of good athletes, but no great
jocks.

Why? Every year, I understand, we admit
potential Rhodes scholars, potential anarchists,
potential poets, and potential jocks — but what
happens to them?

if we had a potentially brilliant poet, we would
probably do our best to turn him into a good
new critic, teach him to think analytically instead

of by analogy or worse. I don’t know what we
would do with a future Bill Russell, Churchill,
Einstein, or Malcom X. Try to make them more
like us, I suppose, and If that didn’t work, flunli
them out.

And I don’t know what we would do about
social regulations. if we had a female Wittgen-
stein would we let her live off campus? Or if we
had a Picasso wouldn’t we have to chase the fe-
male models out of his room and tell him to go
paint squirrels?

I am not suggesting that every rule-breaker is
a future Picasso, nor am 1 suggesting that we
should fill our campus with poets, nor am I even
suggesting that we need fewer normal, sane, re-
sponsible people. i just think that to give better
balance to our campus population we need a few
more unbalanced people. And, I think, one of the
reasons we don’t have a decent number of crazy
people, and one of the reasons we can’t keep
the few we do get is that we make it too difficult
to be crazy here; we have too many written and
unwritten rules against being crazy.

In one way or another, we rule out drunken<
ness, idleness, over-specialization, fornication,
under-specialization, nudity, prostitution, privacy,
obscenity, gluttony, bludgery, creativity, non-cre-
ativity, pettifoggery, and, alas, even motherhood.

Now as a student and teacher of language, 1
respect rules and regulations. I realize that with
out rules no one could live, work, or even write
a coherent sentence. but one of the maddening
problems which every already overworked and
underpaid modern language teacher must face
is that of the constant discrepancy between rules
and usage. When should the rule determine the
usage and when should the usage detennine the
mle? And no matter how many scholars work
at breakneck speed to turn out the latest and
most comprehensive grammars, the rules in
those grammars are always at least one step
behind the changes in the living language. Then,
even worse, once one has formulated the rules
which are not subject to change, he still has to
deal with the exceptions to those rules, and even
with the exceptions to the exceptions. And,
worst of all, it usually turns out that no matter
how good and important the rule, the exceptions
are even more important. For instance, in every
language I have studied, the verb “to be" is ir-
regular; and no matter how many or beautiful
the conjugation patterns, and no matter how es
sential these patterns are to the rest of the lan-
guage, the verb “to be” will just not fit in. In
fact in Russian, the verb "to be" was so irregu-
lar that the Russians, thinking they ought to be
more ciVllized and orderly, booted the present
tense of “to be" right out of their language.
That, I suppose, is one way to handle the prob-
lem oi irregularities and exceptions; only now,
no Russian in the world. unless he transfers to
another language, can say to himself or to any-
one else: “Look, here l am.” He has to say:
“Look, here I."

In conclusion, i won't draw any analogies or
propose any solutions. Hi just say that l eagerly
look forward to the day when bulliights are held
on the central quad, when bladderhall scores are
recorded in the 5!er ('1’), and most of all I look
forward to the day when Grinnell can grant to
poets and all kinds of crazy people not only honor-
ary degrees but even regular ones.

Nietzsche once had Zarathustra say: “I say
unto you: one must still have chaos in oneself
to be able to give birth to a danClng star.” I
know that as a serious little college in a corn-
field, we’re not in the dancing star business, but
still, maybe a little more chaos would be nice.

Defending the

To the Editor:

In the editorial stating the
case against the P. a. com.
plex Krys Neumon proposed
that the extravagant P. E, fa.
cilities be significantly modi-
fied. She neglected to point
out how tho modifications

could be made. We would like
to examine the supposedly ex~
travagant P. a. complex in
depth.

Miss Ncuman mentioned dis»
pleasure at being left in the
dark concerning decisions about
the P. E. complex. it is difficult
to avoid lack of information be-
cause the P. E. department
knows what facilities are re-
quired in a complex of this
nature and only the architects
are qualified to design the
structure. The p. E, building
committee was by no means

meeting behind closed doors.
Nantes of the student repre-
sentatives on this committee
were presented to the Senate.
The P. E. staff told the archi»
tects what facilities would be
needed and the architects de-
signed the complex around
these specifications. The fol-
lowing are the )ustlfications
tor the facilities which you see
as so expensive.

Grinnelliuns Attend Vote Conference;
Efforts to lower Voting Age Foil

By Janet l-lala

Two Grinnell students, Mike
Dejoie and Bruce Armstrong,
attended the Iowa Conference
on Lowering the Voting Age held

last Saturday at Camp Sunny-
side in Des Moines, The confer-
ence, sponsored by the lows
Young Democrats, was attended
by high school and college stu-
dents from throughout Town.

The purpose of the conven~
non was the discussion of the

recent bill in the Iowa legisla-
ture to lower the voting age in
Iowa to eighteen. Tuesday, after

the conference, the bill was de-
feated. ,

The Grinnell students attend-
ing went as representatives of a
recently»formed Grinnell Com-
mittee for the Advancement of
Universal Suffrage at Eighteen
— CAUSE, The National Stu-
dent Association, the Young Re
publicans, the Young Demo~
crats, and the lawn Federation
of Teachers were represented
at the meeting.

State Senator John Walsh (R),
who sponsored the bill, and
State Representative Dan John-
son (D) were discussion leaders
for the conference.

Loggia Looks Remain Locked

By Paul Nachman

lf after-hours confinement of
Grinnell coeds constitutes a
fire hazard through possible one
trapment in the loggia, the col-
icge can easily install “panic
push-bars” on the loggia doors
for emergency exit, according

to Building a Grounds (3&6)
Superintendent Evan Walden,

However, the college has
plans for a crashvbar door sys—
tem for next fall that Should
solve the problem," reported
AWS Board President Karen
Lauterbach.

Walden asserted that the ex-
isting iocked-loggia arrange-
ment is safe, since the night
watchman and the housemoth-
ers have keys for the loggia
doors.

in the unlikely event that the
doors should remain lucked
during a bad, earlyunoming
fire, said Walden, the women

can traverse the loggia a long
way in either direction or they
can escape through first-floor
windows on the street side of
the Quad.

Loci-ring of die doors appar—
ently violates Section L2 of the
state firesatety regulations for
dormitories:

“aims shall be so arranged
and maintained as to provide
free and unobstructed egress
from all parts of every builds
lng 01‘ structure at all times
when the building or sti—iic-

titre is occupied. No loolcs or *

fastenings to prevent free es-
cape from the inside of any
building shall be installed on
exit doors,"

In an Sail! interview Monday,
Walden said that he was un-
aware ot this rule, emphasizing,
though. that tire prevention ii
a very strong 138:6 concern.

“They get tired of our carping
about fire hazards around
here," he noted

The tiresaiety code also di-
rects the State Fire Marshal to
make regular inspections of cole
legs iaCIlities. “The State Fire
Marshals have never inspected
our buildings.” commented Wai-
den. “Schools seem out of
bounds for them,

“It‘s the same at other
schools — they don't have in-
spections, We are inspected
twice a year by our insurance
companies." he added.

However. the February 2i
Des Moines Register reported
that State Fire Marshal Wil<
our Johnson's staff has inspect-
ed all Iowa colleges and uni-
versities, except Grinnell and
the University of iowa. within
the last two years.

Johnson plans to inspect
Grinnell sometime this spring

Other aspects of the fire-safe
ty situation on South Campus
have periodically been criticiz~
ed. Last spring Miss Lauter-
bach found that many fire ex-
tinguislieis in the women’s
halls were inoperable due to un-
derpressiire. They have since
been recharged.

She aso termed the fire es-
capes that Iead into the court-
yards between individual dorms
“a farce.” Most of them end
nine feet. above the ground —
too high for safe jumps. Sev-
eral of the courtyards them-
selves are fire traps, she adds,
because they are planted with
flammable shrubbery,

Walden explained that the fire
escapes do not reach the ground

primarily to keep children
from playing on them.

He noted that semesterly iii-o
drills on South Campus. also m-
quired by state law, have prov-
en effective in alerting the
women to emergency proced-
ures. The halls, Walden said,
can be cleared in about two
minutes

Miss Lauterbach said, how
ever, that five minutes is I
more reasonable estimate for
emptying the loggia.

The men's halls have long
violated the fire drill require.
ment; there have been no drills
on North Campus for about ten
years. according to Head Resi-
dent Terry Moore. They prob-
ably have not been reinstituted
because no one would fakl
them seriously, he speculated.

President Glenn Leggett said
Thursday that he has asked
Walden to meet with the State
Fire Marshal and that the col-
lege does not plan any action
until it receives state instruc-
tion.

President Leggett added that
Walden had assured him that
the dormitory buildings are iire<
proof and that the possibility
of fire spreading throughout the
Quad was .very unlikely.

Walden also told Leggett that
women students would not be
trapped in the event the dorm
caught on fire because the head
residents would unlock the
doors with their keys. Mr. Leg.
gett affirmed, however, that ro«
liance on a few keys to free
hundreds of students might
prove inadequate in a panic
situation,

Attenlpi to REACH Across Gulf;
College-Town Group Now Defunct

ay niyllis Murray

Defunct now except for its
high school tutoring program.
REACH was potentially one of
Grinnell's most forceful college
groups. The organization, how-
ever inactive at present, rep
resents an idealistic concern
which, though dormant, is not
entirely dead among Grinnell
students.

Begun in the tall of 1965,
REACH was the outgrowth of
student participation during the
preceding summer in a Chicago
social action program of the
same name, The Chicago pro-
iect, which had included classes,
workshops, and cultural ﬁeld-
trips for high school students
of varying backgrounds, stimu-
lated several Grinnell students
into considering a comparable
program for the Grinnell com-
munity.

An early report of the Grin-
nel REACH group described the
purposes of the organization as
“providing a basis for a coming.
together of different economic
groups" and as “providing a
new meeting ground which could
reach across old separations."

in the process of planning
specific action, the initial lead-
ers. of whom Jeanne Cook, Jane
Parish and George Wittgraf
were most active. explored ex-
isting town facilities and exist<

little opportunity for constructive

By last fall, attempts to re

beyond the tutorial coordination
effort. Asked why REACH had
failed, neither Jeanne Cook nor

simply a combination of “in-
sufficient organization,” “too
little free time." and "dlsap«

tion is or special importance
for it marks the fiftieth annir
versary of the ARFCW.

Grinnell has in past year-
always sent delegates to na-
tional, regional and state Eon-

tion to become a delegate is i&
[lied this year to all interested
students. The Grinnell WRA
hopes to send a large delega-
tion because it feels that this
convention will be of signifi-
cant value in exploring the
role of recreation for the total
oollege community.

This is of more than theoretir
cal interest, for Grinnell is
about to begin a new recrea-
tion program, indicated by the
planned physical education
complex.

The convention entails a

“i am living on campus to
an apartment right now, and
I much prefer it to living in
the dormitory. i think that
when everything is added up,

ty, lurniture, etc, 1 end up
spending the same amount
of money i did on a dorm

quiet, and feeling of real in-
dependence make all campus
living much more desirable
and enjoyable."

"Students are young adults

should be permitted to choose

“Up to a point dorm life can
be beneficial in that the in<

through discussion with many
diiierent people, on the type
of life he wants for himself.

decided how he Wants to live,
it is just as necessary for
him, in a learning situation

Convention Politics

By Dan Bucks

The longest and closest convention in SGA
history ended at 1:45 a.m,, Monday, with the

withdrawal speech of Ray Horn. The two vote
leaders, and only remaining candidates from an
original field of four, Craig Allin and Rio Made
Dowel], were thus nominated for the election on
iTuesday.

The one decisive factor that gave Allin and
MacDowell more votes than Horn was superior
ﬂoor organization All three of the candidates
came into the convention with wide, and appar-
ently nearly equal, popular
support, The technical po<
Iltical skill of the Allin and
MacDowell supporters ene
nbled them to pick up a few
extra independent votes in
the convention.

Early in the balloting, the Allin organization
launched a vote drive that caught the other
groups somewhat by surprise. Instead of playing
I cautious game and hiding votes as did the
lther groups, the Allin workers revealed their
candidate’s vote strength on the third ballot by
lhooting Allin's total up to 69 votes from the 24
that he received on the previous ballot. By the
fifth ballot, a snowball effect had lifted Allin’s
ﬁnal to E7.

The MacDowell supporters were able to re-
Ipond to the Allin initiative muchtmore rapidly

than were the Horn workers. They broke the We
vole level on the sixth ballot, and on the seventh
ballot MacDowell's vote total actually exceeded
Allin’s. Also, on the seventh ballot, the Horn sup-
porters finally rallied and managed to boost
Ray's total above 91).

Because the Allin and MacDowell organizaa
tions were able to make their vote drives earlier
than the Horn organization, they could consoli-
uate their support earlier and at a slightly higher
level. Both Allin and MacDowell had, in the later
ballots, effective support that could keep their
vote totals in the high 90‘s and above. The Horn
supporters, however, had their effective support
limited to the low 90’s.

A clear distribution of candidate support also
emerged in the later ballots. Allin's support was
based on South Campus votes, while Machwell
and from both relied on North Campus for their
primary support. an the last four announced bola
lots, Allin drew an average of 54% of his votes
from South Campus and 46% from North Campus.
Horn, on the same ballots, received just 43% of
his support from South Campus while 57% of his
votes were from the men’s halls.

MacDowell's support was even more overhal-
anced toward North Campus, with 59% of his
votes coming from there. Allin’s strength on
South Campus was later reflected in the fact
that he carried the women’s halls by a slim mar-
gin in Tuesday's election, but lost to MacDowell
by a decisive margin on North Campus.

A Motion to Abolish
The SGA Convention

By Mary Malcolm

Ed Note: A motion to elimi-
nate the SGA convention will
be presented to the Senate
next Wednesday night.

The benefits of the SGA cone
vention are clear. The most
valuable one is that it involves
a large number of students in
student government, and thus
increases the probability of an
SGA which is in touch with the
students. The convention in-
volves students who serve as
delegates in the process of
nominating the SGA president.
As an all-campus activity (and
all-campus activities are rather
rare) it involves another sub-
stantial number of students as
observers.

There is also some benefit in
the way in which a convention
involves students. Organized
groups of supporters, in order
to win delegations. must not
only support a candidate but
know why, and be prepared to
articulate their reasons. Prior
to the conventions, “machines"
are forced to deal with the in-
formation of the campaign, and
this is a very good thing.

When the convention is under-
way, the “machines” having
wound up with actual facts and
issues, however equivocal, dur-
ing the campaign go into a final
run which is not very informa-
tional, The convention itself is
the ideal arena for pressure
politics, imposed not only by
the “machines" on wavering
delegates, but also by vehe
merit hall delegations on dis-
senting voters. Although a cer-
tain minimum of individual in-
tegrity would, in theory. render
such pressure ineffective, the
pressure makes the lo-hour con-
Ventiun into a marathon endur-
ance test. A dirty kind of poll-
tics. based on negative argu-
ments and group pressure, goes
on in the convention which would
simply not be as useful in a
general primary election, where
each Vote is cheaper and given
only once and in secret.

Unique to the convention is a

low level of obscenity occasion-
ally disguised as humor, and
muck-raking rivalry between
halls and campuses. Unique to
the convention is one of the
largest useless expenditures of
human time and energy I have
encountered on this Campus.
Over 3600 man hours went into
the 1967 Convention at Darby,
and the actual purpose served,
that of narrowing the field to
two candidates, could have been
accomplished neatly and clean~
ly (and, comparatively, instan-
taneously) by means of a prl.
mary election.

The elimination of jag candi-
dates, nominating speeches, and
the instructed ballot has been
suggested as a compromise. it
is a valuable compromise inas.
much as it could preserve the
convention’s useful function of
stimulating B wellrorganized,
enthusiastic, informative cam.
paignr However, such a pruning
of the convention leaves its ug-
liest blemish untouched: the
fact that it offers a situation
where high pressure politicl
are peculiarly useful. While
pruning the convention would
lessen the waste of time and
energy, and lower the obscenr
lty level, (with, incidentally, n
corresponding dip in the excito<
ment and participation gener.
ated). it would not strike at the
heart of the problem, “political
animalism."

“Political animalism" is not
something ive can entirely elim-
inate, anymore than we can
raise participation to a full 100
per cent. But in planning Cam-
paign and election procedures,
we must seriously bear in mind
that some activities are mot!
conducive to animalism than
others. i am not going to deny
that the convention achieves A
high water mark in participa-
tion. It is noteworthy that only
76 per cent of the campus voted
in this year’s final elections. 1
will deny that this participation
is either especially instructive
to the individual or strengthen-
ing to the student government
association.

MacDowell Elecfed

By Pat Smith

Ric MacDowell, SGA Presi-
dent-Elect, said Wednesday in
a statement for the 5&8, “The
success of next year's student
gnvemment will depend not
merely upon the enthusiasm of
the student leaders, but upon
the enthusiasm of the students

' as well.

“The year 1967-1968 will be
very important in setting new
precedents for - - -
the role of
student gov-
ernment, and
much t i m e
will be spent
working in
the context of
a new struc-
ture for the

Wllesc com— Munowell

munity in the proposed abolie
tion of Women’s hours, the new
court system. and the South
Campus resident program. Also,
the newly elected leaders will
need the support and the ideal
of the student body."

Craig Allin, who ran a close
race for the sea Presidency
against MacDowell, expressed
his congratulations to MacDow—
ell. and his desire to thank
all who helped him in his Cam-
paign. He added that perhapn
he would apply for a position on
the new community court

Ray l-lom was out of town,
and hence unavailable for some
ment at press time, and Trip
Kennedy said he would do what
he could to help MacDowell,
but could foresee no political
plans for himself. ‘ ’

‘iiii Uncertain Trumpet’

By David Dillon

The recent SGA election
raises more questions than it
resolves. The student body has
failed to provide a clear man-
date in regard to its long-term
aims and the means of their at~
talnment. The new SGA leader-
ship must be challenged to
formulate more clearly its di-
rection and programs,

Two distinct approaches to
campus affairs were represent-
ed in this campaign. The first—
that of Ray Horn — sought
progress through deliberation
and accommodation. Legislation
of social life had to be shared
with the administration. Accord-
ing to this position, positive
academic co-operation could
more readily ensue if efforts
for rule changes were tempered
and moderated.

This outlook revealed many
defects: it relied heavily on
diplomacy and good will from
an administration which, de-
spite polite denials, has been
often "neither nice nor ration-
at.” Genuine differences of
value were ignored. The rigidity
imposed by structural necesSity
-— the pressure tor students,
taculty, and administrators to
follow group interest — was
not adequately faced. Still,
Ham‘s case offered some co-
herence, and bore a small
chance of success

Craig Allin posed campus
problems with much greater
depth and consistency Institu—
tional conflict and disrespect
for rules were to be counter-
acted by student determination
to affirmatively regulate themv
selves. The attainment of more
privacy — an essential aspect
ot the maturing process H was
urged as the primary social
goal. Student participation in
academic liie could be expand»
ed through greater SGA fiscal
independence

While common positions on
matters of campus concern
were to be sought with the ad-
ministration and faculty, time-
tables of action would be fol-
lowed, so that constructive pro-

posals could not be defeated -

through bureaucratic inertia.
Communications with the stu-
dent body — a major issue for
all candidates — would have
been established on a regular
basis, through creation of a
“Privy Council." Formation of
a community court — a guarA
aniee for consistent enforce-
ment of necessary rules — was
given a high priority.

In addition, a realistic attitude
to demonstrations, recognizing
dliterences ot purpose and de
gree, was repeatedly outlined.
Allin offered all these initiatives
Within a cohesive philosophical
framework — a promising inte-
gration of vision and action,

The campaign of Ric Mac-
Dowell seemed in some respects
an unfortunate contest. Having
contributed iiuittully to campus
life — Interim is the best ex-
ample — MacDoweil made
some worthwhile suggestions for
social and academic progress:
e.g., the need for group recrea-
tional events and foundation
grants for sea. But he lacked
a structure to unify his ideas, a
trameworlr of encompassing
goals. Statements on demonstra-
tions and on practical methods
of communication were often
vague, shitting, and uncle-
veloped. In brief, MacDowell
presents a confusing image. His
broad perspectives are appar-
ently “liberal,” but his program
ror implementation seems in-

Proposal for Guaranteed 7' itian

By Suzanne Gelber
5&3 Associate Editor

ED. NOTE: This column is my planned
response to the “News Analysis” article, an-
nouncing a tuition increase. More than
straight reporting, “News Analysis" articles
are intended to serve one of two functions:
either to present interpreﬂve reporting of on
event as a reponer sees it; or to report facts
which are the necessary background for the
presentation of a particular news-based view-
point. The previous article served the latter
function since it was my hope to announce
the tuition rise and the reasons for it in a
manner which would allow me to use that
{actual background in presenting Ihe toilow-
ing editorial view.

President Leggett's announcement of next
years 8160 cost increase, defended as a response
to higher operating costs, raises an interesting
question: is an annual fee increase the only sold
iion available to the college to deal with rising
costs?

Economically Sound Alternative

1 submit that it is not the only solution avail-
able and that an alternative economically sound
and philosophically more justiiiable has been too
peremptoriiy dismissed by the administration.
That alternative is a 4-year guaranteed cost plan,
now in operation at both Beloit and St. Olaf,
which insures entering students a uniform 4—year
fee. (Former editor John Wolf proposed such I
plan in the Nov. 5, 1965, 5&3.)

Legqen. Suits: Say "Unmiistie"

In an interview last week, both President Leg-
gett and Dean Stauss labelled the possibility of
installing a guaranteed cost plan at Grinnell "un-
realistic” and “more trouble than it’s worth."
The administration argument against the guar-
anteed cost plan runs basically as follows:

1) The college’s operating costs are sub-
ject to inflation and are not guaranteed, so
the students should not expect guaranteed
costs either;

2) Unlike Grinnell, schools which have
guaranteed cost programs are church re-
lated. insuring stable endowment;

3) New students would have to bear the
brunt of cost increases under such I plan
and average fees would be higher at Grin-
nell than at competing institutions without
the plan;

4) Therefore, a guaranteed cost plan would

ut Grinnell in r less desirable position
for competition for students, whose parents
would jittigc comparative costs at their face
value;

5) Finally (added as an afterthought by
President Leggett) the application of an en-
tering student is not 1! hlnding legal contract
with the student guaranteeing particular
fees; in fact, an application is merely a one
year proposition concerning I student's Iti-
tendunce It the college.

50 runs the administration position. It sounds
justifiable and realistic — at first, Even a super-
ficial investigation of the argument, however,
reveals not only logical and factual inadequacies,
but assumptions on the part of the administration
which contradict the college’s stated aims.

Strong Case for Cost Plan

There is a strong case to be made for the es-
tablishment of a guaranteed cost plan at Grinnell,
rather than for the unwelcome continuation of
annual cost increase announcements. The case
for guaranteed costs can easily be argued on its
own merits. However, since the administration
has chosen to register only objections to the pro
posal, it may be more significant to establish the
case for guaranteed costs by answering the argu-
ments presented against it.

In discussing the economic and philosophical
justification of the guaranteed cost proposal, eco«
nomics department members Robert H. I-laveman
and William Pollak concurred in the opinion that
such a plan would be “economically feasible” at
Grinnell. Pollak commented more specifically,
"it’s basically a question of whose is the ulti-
mate financial responsibility for rising costs —
the college or the parents.”

Pollak contintted, “What the student is ‘btiy-

ing‘ at Grinnell is a 4-year college education. The
college is in a better posrtion than the parents to
make an educated guess, to take the economic
risk of projecting cost increases which would dot
termine the comprehensive 4-year fee.”

Yearly Raises Nor Responsible

Perhaps it is time to deal with the administran
tlon’s objections to guaranteed costs in their re:
spectivc order. First, the fact that the college’p
operating costs are subject to inflation and arc
not guaranteed does not mean that, therefore,
students’ fees must blindly reflect the samd
trend. If this college were the socially responslvd
and responsible institution it claims to be (so.
President Leggett‘s February 8 speech to the Stu-
dent Senate) and really wished to produce gradrp
ates who reflected the “selfless” character “ilk
herent” in the liberal arts, how could it selfishl!
refuse to accept the economic responsibility for
cost increases?

Schools Have More Stable Income

The administration argues that schools which
presently operate guaranteed cost programs are
church related and therefore have more predict-
able and stable endowments than does Grinnell,
A bit of research uncovered the following inter-
esting facts which reflect on this argument:

1) Grinnell, with an enrournent of 1150, has
on endowment, according to Couege Treas-
urer George Kaufmann, valued as or August
31, 1968 at $16,598,000 (market value; hoolr
value is $10,584,000), including endowed
scholarship funds of $623,000, according to
the present catalog.

2) lioth neloit and st, Olaf have 4-year
guaranteed tuition plans, Both schools have
larger enrollments than does Grinnell (be.
loit, 1350; so Olaf, 2,370). Although St.
out is church-related (American Lutheran
Church) its total endowment of $2,294,000
pales in comparison with our own and yet,
its comprehensive fee ($2200) is lower than
our annual fee. Beloit‘s comprehensive fee
of 33,000 is only 5100 per year more than our
own,

Thus, it is not correct to argue that church}
related schools are necessarily in a better eco-
nomic position and better able to predict their
costs than is Grinnell. Moreover, if both Beloll
and St, Olaf, which are in relatively Inferior eco-
nomic circumstances in comparison to Grinnell,
nevertheless assume the responsibility for cost
increases, there is no economic justification for
Grinnell’s negative position.

Guaranteed Fees a Selling Point

As for the third objection, two colleges with
smaller incomes than Grinnell (and larger stu-
dent bodies) now operating on the guaranteed
cost plan are charging fees either lower or only
slightly higher than Grinnell’s $2900 charge for
1967—68. Moreover, guaranteed cost fees are high-
er than average annual fees only for the initial
two years of a student's attendance and, in the
end, given inflationary costs at Grinnell, probably
tum out to be a long-run saving for the student
and a more predictable income for the collegc.

The public relations effect of a guaranteed
cost plan has not proved unfavorable at either
St. Olaf or Beloit, In fact, both colleges use Ch!
plan as a "selling point" in their catalogs. A
thoroughly explained and publicized guaranteed
cost program at Grinnell might well become an
attractive factor in competition for students.
since other colleges would not be able to offer
parents comparable economic security.

Application Not a Contract

President Leggett’s final objection to a guan-
anteed cost program contains the most dismaying
implications of the argument. While it is true
that an application is not a binding legal con—
tract, it seems like hair-splitting to reiterate thic
point in the face of statements like the toitowing
in the Bulletin (P. 22): “Grinnell is devoted ex-
clusively to the liberal arts. It offers an inter
grated fourvyear program. i ."

An applicant to Grinnell is buying, not a year’s
dormitory residence, but a Grinnell education, an
education which normally takes four years to
complete. A college boasting such on “inte-
grated” program cannot in all conscience frag.
ment its costs and illogicaliy reiuse to consider
an “integrated" 4-year guaranteed fee program.

Chino Turmoil ls Progress: Hinton

By Harold Fuson

Eeset by the inequities of dry
weather, Pennsylvania farmer
William Hinton took time oil
iron: his regular chores this
winter to, in his words, “or-
range some turbulence in China
to give me a platform from
which to speak,” and set oil on
n speaking tour to discuss the
“Cultural Revolution in Chi<
ha,”

The turbulence was no diifi-
cult matter for Hinton to are
range since, as he pointed out
in his talk to a lull South
Lounge on Monday night, “Sen-
ator Eastiand in 1956 proved in
a three hour speech to the Sen-
ate that I had singlehandedly
organized the Communist take-
over oi China.”

Mr. Hinton himself spent two
and a half hours, mostly de-
voted to answering student
questions, giving what he
called a positive view of the
cultural revolution. “China,"
Hinton maintains, “is at a turn-
ing point — a decade of transi«
tion."

The turbulence now taking
place has grown out of the ex-
pulsion or the old commercial
classes from the Chinese ruling
alliance, and represents a liter
tural transition to the next

cording to Hinton, began in the
1340': with the ﬁrst attempts
to overthrow Chinese feudalism
and expel foreign influence.

This first stage was not com-
pleted until 1949, when Mao Tse

dictable but absolutely neces-

Hinton, who speaks from a

A great deal or controversy
has developed over the priority
and cost of the P, E. complex,
These two areas are closely re-
lated. The P. E. complex has
been on the priority list since

several times. However, at this
moment the opportunity for a

grant and the increasing costs
of construction (4%76% au-
nuAlly according to Donald
Lambie, Treasurer of the Col-
lege) have placed the P. E,
complex at the top 0! the

President Glenn Leggett, edu-
Eationnl need determines the

NSA Discontinues CM Support
Grinnell Rep Views NSA Fulure

By Martha Berkey

The disclosure last week that
the National Student Association
has been secretly receiving sub-
stantial funds trom the Central

Intelligence Agency for the last
14 years, has stirred indegent
reaction throughout the organi-
zation and has provoked lurth-
er investigations of CIA pene—
tration in other nonrgovernment<
til associations.

NSA is the nation’s largest
college student group with stu-

dent body membership or about
300 campuses including Grin-
nell. The association operates
on a yearly budget of about
$900,000, $200,000 01 which has
come from the CIA under the
cover oi as private ioundatiun
grant, primarily for use by the
International Affairs branch.
The discovery came in an an
nouncement of an article com-
ing in the March issue of Ram-
parts magazine.

Grimell NSA coordinator Phil
Bertenthol says or the exposed
link-up, "As far as Grinnell
goes, this won't have any aitect
on NSA here. We are involved
primarily in the student-services
angles — the insurance plan,
student lD's, and travel plans.
There are really very low par-
ticipants in the international
activih'es.”

In a statement released by the
National Supervisory Board or
ﬁle USNSA, it said:

We are shocked at the ethi-
cal trap into which young men
or great integrity have been

"0n the Right Track"

By Barry Ancone

The basement of the women's
gym is small, dank and poorly
lighted. It is also the home of
Grinnell's indoor track team.

Nine men, under the coach-
Ing of Gene Kowert, comprise
the team, the smallest in years.
Most of the nine are middle-and
long-distance runners, leaving
sprints, hurdles and field events
harely touched by the Pioneers.
The coach expects to pick up
some hurdlers and sprinters
tram the basketball team, but
this will give an outdoor squad
of only about ﬁfteen.

Where are the track men?
The coach feels he has almost
every good upperclassman run-
ning. The college just isn’t get-
ting track men, or very many
athletes at all, for that matter.

"Athletics is down here,"

Coach Kowert observed “and
probably our only winning
teams next year will be swim-
ming and -wrestling.” The
coach hestitated to assign
blame for the decrease in inter
collegiate participation, but
felt that the current Admissions
Office attitude toward athletics
was somewhat responsible.
“They bring in a group of
freshmen and expect to find a
cross - section of high school
graduates, with a proportionate
number of athletes.” Within the
recruiting rules of the Midwest
Conference, Kowert felt that
more could and should be done
to secure the “scholar-athlete."
“The new fieldhouse would be
a good drawing card,” he add-
ed, "College track meets would
make the atmosphere here
more desirable for high school
students considering Grinnell
and high school meets would

introduce many students to us."

The present track cannot be
used for meets, and its hard
surface and potholes make it
dangerous. The team ran with,
or rather behind, Iowa and
Northeast Missouri State at a
meet Feb. 11 at Iowa City. It
was excellent practice running
on a good track, and Ric Mac-
Dowell turned in 1257.8 in the
hali~mile, llis fastest time.

There is an interest in inter-
collegiate athletics at Grinnell,
but it waxes and wanes with
the success of its teams. Ath-
letics is, and should be, a part
of Grinnell life. It is unfortunate
that present circumstances have
placed it in such a poor position.
Consideration of a new field-
house and a more realistic ad-
missions policy are not the
only solutions to the problems.
but they are certainly on the
right track.

Maimen Win
Saturday Match

The Grinnell wrestlers upset
a strong team from Monmouth
College 21-19 Saturday in Darby
Gym. The victory was not as-
sured until the last second of
the final match.

Mike Martinson, 115, won a
5-0 decision; Roger Claw, 123,
was pinned in 3:30; and Grin-
nell forfeited the 130 class. This
put the Monmouth Scots ahead
1073.

John Loventhal, 137, fought
his opponent to a,6—6 tie. and
John Sharpe went unchallenged
at 145. Bob Van Wyck won u
6—0 decision to put the Pioneers
on top 13—12.

Randy Stare lengthened the
lead, winning 5-2 at 160. The 161
match, feared to be a forfeit by
Grinnell, turned out to be a “no
contest." Don Kraitsik, moving
up to 177 for this week’s meet,
came close to a pin several
times and won M, putting the
team scores at 1912.

The heavyweight class was a
forfeit by Grinnell due to Bob
Geller's move down to 191, so
the score entering the final
match was 19-17. A three point
decision would have been
enough for a Monmouth vic-
tory, but Geller came from be-
hind to tie his match at 2»2 and

' lend Grlnnell to victory.

In f r e s h m a n exhibition
matches, Dave Jaeger, lis, won
t 16—0 decision, and Bill Wed-
ding won 4-2 at 177. Bob La-
Bell, 160, dropped 2‘13. Bob Jen-
kins, wrestling MollmDuth’s var-
sity 130 man, pinned him at
2:40!

The grapplers did not fare as
well against Cornell Monday.
The freshmen were defeated
2979. and the varsity shared
their fate, losing 3043.

The resignation of the Pioneer
varsity’s no man adds another
gap to the thinning teani. The
wrestlers take on Carleton and
St. Olaf tomorrow at Northlleld.

[age Will, Lose Two

By Barry Ancona

The Pioneer basketball team
stopped their losing streak at
22 by beating Coe 5245 last Fri.
day at Cedar Rapids. The long-
awaited victory was witnessed
by five Grinnell students.

The Pioneers played an eX<
cellent game, and led through
out. They were up 4246 at the
half. The team played heads-up
ball, giving up only two turn-
overs and hitting most of their
free throws. Rebounding: , rk-
ed by Thor Evenson, nclped
keep Grinnell on top all the
way.

The Pioneers ran a successful
stall for the last three minutes
of the game, something they
have rare occasion to do. The
scoring: Schwartz, la; Evenson,
13; Wlngata, 12; Hill and Able,
10; Lower, 93 Hibhs, ﬂ; Rankin,
4.
The team's effort against Be
loit the next day was less effec-
tive. The Pioneers lost 7354. No
Grinnellian scored more than
oightpoints.

The Pioneers hosted Mon-
mouth niesday and the Scots
were victorious 87-71. The first
team started'but was replaced
as the first period wore on. The
Pioneers trailed by only iour
points at the half.

The defeat came in the first
few minutes of the second half,
as Monmouth rolled up a '
teen-point lead. The scoring:
Evenson, 16; Hill, ; Able arid
Hibbs, 8; .Schwartz. 7; Brintnall
and Wingate, a; Lower, 5; Watt
and Musser, 2..

, Schwartz and Hlbbs dropped
to seventh and eighth in confer-

ence scoring after Tuesday’s
game.

The team travels in Northfield
this weekend to take on strong
teams at Carleton and St. Olaf.
A home game against Coe next
Friday should give Grinnell tans
a chance to see a Pioneer vio-
tory. A big turnout would look
good in Darby, and we should
be rewarded with a win.

Swimmers Win
Triangular

The Grinnell swimming team
was victorious over Coo and
Knox last Saturday in the Grin-
nell pool, Final snort of tho
triangular meet was Grinneil
73, Knox 59, C09 22,

Bill Lontz captured two first:
and Rich Lance and Ken Adel-
man each won single events.
The medley relay team also
won,

The freshmen swam exhibi-
tion in both relays, and broke
conference records in both. The
team of Warn-ran, Siekzrt, Wil-
iiams, and Pedersen broke the
old iooyard medley relay mark
with a time of 4107.5. The old
mark was 4:08]. The AUG-yard
ireestyle relay oi McElain,
Pedersen, Schaalman, and
Warman eclipsed the old record
by five seconds with a time of
3:38.

The Pioneers swim at home
again this weekend taking on
two strong teams: Lawrence to-
day at 4 pm, and Eeloit to<
morrow at 1 pm. These should
be fine meets to watch,

er-coach Betsy James sent her
James Hall purehearts out to
tackle Mears in the battle of the
titans, Going into this contest,
James led the league With a 3—0
mark while Mears was 24].

Betsy James and Cindy Root
jumped center and with the tip,
the last semblance of sanity and
organization passed. The first
five minutes of the game was
highlighted by seven jump
balls. four fouls and no points.

By the end of the first quar-
ter, Mears had jumped out to a
7:0 lead in a fantastic some‘
thing or other shot by “Red"
Railsback. The second quarter
brought disaster to James as
Betsy James went to the side.
lines with a sprained ankle.
With this, James lost their best
player. Cindy Root scored and
Marsha Drake made the first of
her free throws and the halftime
score was 4-1.

The last halt was equally ex-
citing as Marie Wong got four
points to pace Meal-s while
James could only cash in on an-
other oi Marsha Drake's soft
free throws. The final score was
10-2 and the victory catapulted
Mears into first place, James
dropped to second and Main
held third with a 2-1 mark.

For those interested, there is
an all—star game Saturday, Feb

ruary 25 at 1:00. For the uninili.
sited, this is a spectacle worth
seeing. i think the type of game
you will see can best be ex-
pressed by the remark of one of
the Mears girls made late in the
game, “Pass it to her, she's in
the end zone."

Returning to the mundane
world of North Campus bas<
ketball, Clark continued to show
late season improvement as
they beat co—leader Smith twice.
The “A” team, led by Bill Lee:
30 points beat Smith “A" by
nine while Sam Cartell’s free
throw with 8 seconds leit in the
game gave Clark “B" a one
point victory.

Dibble solidified its hold on
first by tossing West its fifth
and sixth losses of the season.
South “A" confounded the ex.
perts by winning a game. thul
leaving only Cowles and Gate:
“B" squads without a triumph.
That stalemate will end this
week although it is possible that
both teams will lose. The ac-
companying statistics are not
