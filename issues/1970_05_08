Grinnell College Closes Doors in Protest

Memorial Service
Held On Wednesday

By Greg Butcher

President Glenn Leggctt, SGA
President Andrew Loewi, and
Dean Joseph Wall addressed a
liaslilyrcalled all—College Con-
vocation Wednesday on Central
Campus

Following announcements by
Loewi and an invocation by Rev.
Dennis l-laas, President Leggett
spoke about the week's events
and the College community‘s
response:

”Yesterday was a terrible day
[or all oi us individually . . .but
the College as an institution also
had’a terrible day. I do not
personally believe that the
cancellation of classes as a form
of protest was the wisest course
[or us to follow.

“We should be committed to
doing as much as we can to make
society better than it is, But i
think we have got to do this from
the solidly established home base
oi the college and devise a series
oi constructive proposals, oi
which this memorial service and
the visit oi iaculty, students, and
administrators to Congress, are
solid instances. otherwise, i
believe we will continue to go
from one ad-hoc determination to

another, and that irustration and
depression will continue to ac-

cumulate until this precious little
college comes apart at the
seams.”

Loewi tollowed President
Leggett's speech with a short,
terse address He said in part:

“It has become clear that We
are beginning to witness the
same kind of irrational
repression that occurred in Nazi
Germany. . .Yesterday tor the
first time this institution took a
stand on a political issue, It is a
big iirst step, but it is not enough.
it this institution is going to
survive as a place [or rational
inquiry, it must in the times
ahead commit itself to political
action on all fronts . , .I don’t
consider this service to be a
memorial to those. who have died
7 it may be a memorial to
America, ihope we can work to
Ensure that it is note"

Dean Wall gave the final
speech, in which he tried to place
the recent events in historical
perspective, citing a lengthy
passage irom Henry David
Thoreau Some oi his remarks
were as follows:

“These are tragic days ior us
as a College, tor us as Black men
and white men, ior us as
Americans, {or us as inhabitants
oi this small planet, which is
being polluted by industrialism
and deiiled by war. . .We con-
demn and we weep in our despair
and frustration. Condemnation
certainly is important but
despair is selidcstructivc."

As members of an institution
committed to reason and
morality and to the relationship
between private and public
responsibility, we, the majority
oi Faculty and Students oi
Grinnell College, joined by other
Citizens of the city of Grinnell,
vigorously condemn the recently
intensified aggressive action of
the United States in Cambodia
and Vietnam and the acts of
oiiieial repression so obvious in
recent days at Kent State and
other universities These im-
moral and irrational acts and
others similar to them threaten
the life of this institution and
other institutions of higher
education; they disrupt the
process oi learning, increase the
polarization of society, and
society’s potential for violence.
These acts must be condemned,
and we condemn them,

We urge all academic in-
stitutions and all citizens to take
a similar position and to join us in
making their voices heard in
centers of state and national
decisionrmaking, We are sending
official delegations to the
Governor of Iowa, the President
of the United States, and the
Congress. .We encourage others
to do likewise.

and Administrators of Grinnell
College, and by Concerned

Campus radicals took control of [he ROTC building on
Tuesday and were joined by a curious and semi—participa-
tive crowd of as many as four hundred students at one
point. Chiei Peters graciously lent his car as a chair. A

good time was had by all.

Students Debate College
Shut-Down: Poll To Be Taken

Altcr eight hours of at times
stormy debate in two meetings a
set of proposals was drawn up to
be submitted to a student opinion
poll to be held Friday in the lunch
lines in addition a student strike
was Called,

in a twoehour meeting Wed-
nesday night a group or about 600
students passed a resolution
proposed by Tom Thomas.

“1. To continue discussions
with the specific intent to suspend
normal institutional activities oi
Grinncll College with Considerar

and ireedom ior individual action

Students Fast, Occupy
Chapel for Contemplation

Tuesday afternoon Jim
Demopulos, Grinnell sophomore,
moved into Herrick Chapel for a
period oi three days oi tasting
and thought. He was later joined
by others, who resolved to share
his time of living on bread and
water and searching the soul, and
by Wednesday morning the group
had grown to tour: Mike
O'Connor, Dave Walker, and
Anne Bendheim, all sophomores.

It was apparent to those who
dropped in to talk to them that
they saw their action as an
alternative to what was going on
at the ROTC building. When
approached ior comment they
were quite reluctant to grant
anything like an interview, since
it was not their stated intention to
set an example.

Jim pointed out that the think-
in started out as his own “ego
trip,” an attempt to get away
from the roar outside and think
by himself. All four felt that
getting away irom the group
mentality ,was a good thing,

getting away to a place Where it
is possible to think things out and
make personal decisions.

Mike said he wanted to do some
thinking about where he was
going, what he was going to be
iive years, ten years irom now.
He also had decided to get away
irom what he reierred to as hasty
action and “do a little thinking in
this nice, big, quiet place."

Anne emphasized their in»
tention to be themselves and not
an example to others. She ad
mitted the practical impossibility
oi this, but tell the action
nonetheless more important than
the example. She said, “The
people around here who think
don‘t know what to do. The people
who don’t think don‘t know
either, but they do it anyway.”

When pressed ior a statement,
they quoted a song by the Moody
Blues:

“Gazing past the planets,
Looking ior total view,

iaculty,

“2. That students meet tomorr
row at 9:00 AM in Roberts
Theatre to draw up a speciiic
proposal to be presented to the
students ior reierendum vote and
to the faculty.“

Andy lnewi called the meeting
loordcr at aboutB:30; whereupon
a collection was taken to help de-
lray the cost or sending ,d'elega
tion irom Grinnell College to
Washington, D. C.

Tom Thomas, just back irom
Ohio, where he had talked to a
iew people connected with the
Kent State incident, gave a briei
outline oi the iacts, as he knew
them, about Kent State, about
Cambodia, and about the actions
oi other colleges across the
nation. He then argued that the
present situation required the
commitment of the institution to
“non-violent action” in order to
“put pressure on the Nixon ad-
ministration to change its
policies.”

Much debate iollowed, on both
sides oi the question. Various
suggestions were made: that
Grinnell Closc completely tor the
duration oi the year, that classes
he allowed to continue on an op»
tional basis ior those students
who wished to continue their
work, that classes be cancelled
completely and workshops in
volving townspeople be held on
the campus about the present sit-
uation at Kent State and in
Cambodia, and that the school
remain open tor the rest or the
term, those studcnts who wish to
participate in the demonstrations

DEBATE—
Continued on page 4

On Tuesday oi this week, the
iaculty voted to suspend classes
ior two days in protest oi the
recent events at Kent State
University. The statement at
protest. included here, also
condemned this country’s in~
volvement in Cambodia and
Vietnam,

Earlier in the day. the Senate
and a group oi about three
hundred other students met in the
South Lounge to drait and discuss
the resolution at protest, An
amendment to the resolution was
proposed which would have in-
cluded a demand to tree all
“political prisoners“ including
Bobby Scale. The amendment
was voted down by a narrow
margin,

President Leggett was present
at this meeting to suggest
possible changes in the resolution
which would make it more ac-
ceptable to the iaculty, The
assembled students then over-
whelmingly voted to accept the
resolution.

Minutes later the iaculty
convened to debate the
resolutions A number or amend-
ments were oiiered, including
one which would have
speciiically condemned student
violence as well as “official"
violencel All the amendments
were rejected.

Mr. Horton, however, did
propose an addition to the
resolution which was to send a
delegation of students and [acuity
and townspeople to Washington,
D.C, to protest personally. This
addition was accepted. The
faculty then overwhelmingly
voted to accept the resolution.
The vote was 71-6 Wim 9 abr
stentions.

According to the resolution, all
campus iunctions, excluding the
operation oi the dining halls and
the residence halls would be
suspended for the remainder 0i
Tuesday and Wednesday.

“When Logic and Proportion
Have Fallen Softly Dead”

Tuesday at noon the faculty of this college con-
vened in a special meeting to pass a resolution. That
is just what they did. They did not meet to consi-
der the possibility of passing a resolution, and those
of them who thought so were quickly corrected by
Andy Loewi when he told them that unless they
passed the resolution as the student senate had
drafted it, the students would not endorse it, but
would have their own separate resolution.

At no time was the idea of individual con-
science, so loftily vaunted during the decision not to
meet classes for the duration of the moratorium and
the B & G strike, seriously considered, except in a
single speech by John Crossett, Classical Languages.
He was quickly dismissed as a coward by a small
herd of individuals relying heavily on each others
support.

Dean Wall informed the faculty, after they
succeeded with long arguments in retaining their
commitment to the word ”morality” in their resolu-
tion, that it would be a moral obligation for every
faculty member to obey this directive from his col-
leagues. The question of the legality of the action
was raised, but also quickly shoved aside in the
hurry to appease the student senate. After the reso-
lution carried on a vote of 71-6 with strong urging

from Dean Walker, who informed the faculty that
they had no right to defeat a resolution on which
the students had so grcatly compromised them-
selves, a simple phone call to the college lawyer
confirmed that the action, indeed, was quite prob-
ably illegall We are aware, of course, that any indi-
vidual who rises up alone to sue the college will be
a coward.

Shortly after the faculty gave the student sen-
ate what it demanded, there began a meeting on
central campus to discuss the issues involved. After
a couple of hours it developed that these issues were
not the real ones, or at least not important enough to
involve action, so everyone sauntered over to the
ROTC building for that sportiest of sports, a building
takeover.

After the building had been stuffed with smug
revolutionaries, and Mr. Ayers, Grinnell’s first poli-
tical refugee, had been driven out by fear of arson,
mayhem, or worse involving his home, which hap~
pened to be in back of the building, students gath-
ered on the front porch and lawn to smile warmly
and chant “We shall not be moved." The festival
atmosphere received a real shot in the arm when
Chief Peters came by and lent his car, which he
conveniently parked in front of the building, to the
students as a stool, and then cracked a few jokes
with students. When President Leggett and the
Deans showed up, the party was complete, and the
remainder of the afternoon was a protest so power-
ful as to put a smile on the face of anyone. Except a
thinker.

Earlier that morning, several budding young
fascists had decided that something had to be done
in response to the deaths of the five students at Kent
State. After rejecting mourning or an appeal to the
sentiments of their classmates, they decided not to
give their classmates a chance to express their feel-
ings at all or even to think, but rather to sit down
in front of the library to keep everyone from enter-
ing. This upset quite a few students and faculty, and
it is only due to the tendency to non-action on the
part of all Grinnellians that these young guardians
of our basic freedoms were not unceremoniously
dumped over the rail of the library. Possibly also
because they chose to leave the side entrance gra~
ciously unguarded, there was a little traffic in and
out of the library in the morning. As soon as the fa-
culty decision to appease the student body by shut-
ting the college down came into effect, that stopped
too.

In the past Grinnell has been a place where
little thought or reason was devoted to the process of
making decisions. There have, however, been few
days noted for the wholesale abandonment of reason
as last Tuesday.

__
The barbarians have occupied the AFROTC
building. The administration has gone to Washing-
ton to assuage its collective conscience. And nothing
is being done.

There exists a regular procedure to deal with
takeovers of College buildings, The procedure in-
cludes obtaining a court injunction to evict the stu-
dents from the building, The procedure does not in-

)clude the administration’s running away from the
' problem.

As long as the barbarians occupy the building
and go unpunished, and as long as a cowardly ad-
ministration acquiesces in this behavior, Grinnell
College remains an affront to the idea of a free aca-
demic institution. We deserve better.

Letters

To The Editor:

This is the first time that [have
felt constrained to write a letter
to the editor to express my deep
concern over an issue in my nine
years at Grinnell College. I feel
that the action of the “majority at
the faculty and students" of
Grinnell College sets a most
dangerous precedent, As I un-
derstand this action it in effect
puts any minority constituency ot
the institution in the position of
supporting views with which they
might disagree. This is a blatant
abridgement of the foundational
principle of an academic in-
stitution as expressed in the
concept of “academic freedom"
which holds that each person is
entitled to his own opinions and
has the right to express them.

Let it be clearly understood
that I abhore war wherever it is
fought and T likewise am
sickened by violence of any kind.
1 am not speaking for or against
the issues raised in the resolution
adopted by the faculty at the
special meeting of May 5, but
rather to the deliberate and
conscious intention to speak as an
institution rather than as a
majority of that institution. This
action was most surprising in
view of similar actions recently
taken by a majority of the faculty
such as the various resolutions
concerning moratorium days. in
these resolutions great care was
taken to preserve the right of the
individual dissenter who found
himself in the minority to do his
own thing and not to be labeled
with the majority with which he
disagreed. This careful action to
respect the indmdual’s con
science and freedom made me
proud to be a part of such an
institution.

However, it seemed to me that
emotions were allowed to
overcome reason in the debate of
May 5. This is a most dangerous
situation since we often regret
later what has been done under
the pressures of a difficult
emotional situation, The most
alarming feature of this action is
that it took place not in some mob
street scene, but in the
deliberative halls of the faculty of
an academic institution
dedicated to academic freedom,
ii the strongholds of our freedom
such as our colleges and
universities are prone to
the suppression of indivi-
dual freedom then what
of individual freedom then what
hope is there for the country at
large. It seems in me that the
same tactics of domination by the
majority which are being
deplored in the actions of our
government which claims to
speak for the “silent majority”
are being employed by the
majority of the faculty and
students at Grinnell College. Two
wrongs never make a right.
Domination of the majority
whether silent or vocal over [he
minority is not right or humane.

Prologue: A crisis hovers over
the kingdom of Collegium. A
proposal is before the Senate, the
acceptance of which will give the
barbarians an equal vote in the
governance oi the kingdom. The
proposal was brought to the
Senate by those who think that
the barbarians are really
Colleagues at heart. The Senate
sits in solemn Conclave to decide
on the late of the kingdom.

Act I:

First Senator: I see that a
number of our young brethren
are missing, Why is that?

Second Senator: They do battle
tor the glory ol Collegium on the
Macus Campus.

First Senator; It is just as well.
The young tight better than they
govern anyway.

Enter King Leggettus.

King Leggettus: According to
the words of the great
philosopher Staussus, “if halt the
people in attendance are here,
that constitutes a quorum." I
agree. We must make progress
today, people of Collegium. The
eyes of the whole country are
upon us.

Senators: Amen.

Act II:

Walllls: We understand that the
Senate is making splendid
progress on the barbarian pro-
blem. best you are soon idle, we
bring to you another solemn
proposal. since this proposal,
which will heretofore be known
as the Clotus Feltus proposal, is
at least twice as important as the
barbarian proposal, it lollows by
iron logic that you will be able to
make a sage decision on it in ones .*
lourth the time, We know your
mettle, people oi Collegium.
Thus, not only will we vote on the
Feltus proposal at the next
solemn conclave, we will try to
leave time [or as little discussion
as possible. You have made
Collegium great, you alone can
preserve her greatness.

Third Senator: You cannot be
serious prince. Surely you jest.

Christianus: Incredible. In-
credible. Incredible. Incredible. I
am surprised.

Gilmour. the Oracle: Hearken!
The winds of change are blowing
through Collegium. The bar-
barians are our friends. We will
have peace in our time.

The World Is Watching

Grinnell Stands Up And is Counted

By Tom Greenﬁeld

Grinnell College ushered itself
into the world of political com-
mitment when that great, big,
willowy, voluptuous hunk oi
flesh, The Body oi the Whole, got
itself together and laid it‘all on
the line last Tuesdav morning.
With'a crucial'iaculty meeting a
mere twenty minutes away The
Bod decided to approve a stator
menl to the effect that the institur
tion of Grinnell does not like the
Cambodian War or political rer
pression, The Bod doesn't like
what is happening to political prir
Sorters either, but that‘s going to
have to wait on account oi “prior
ﬂies") and will close down ”all
operations“ to talk things over
and to protest hither and yon.

In spite OI the Bod's ability to
pass a hastily written proposal,
many people present were
troubled by the latiguc and wanr
der lust which invariably takes
over the Bod’s collective “mind".
