Presideni Leggell Discusses
Hall System Considerations

“By March or April we will
have to make some decisions about
the possible reorganization or the

residence hall system. and ! hope
the matter will be well talked a-

bout by then," said president
Glenn Leggett during an interview
with the 5&3 Wednesday.

“The larger question is whether
life in the residence halls has dce
cayed and, if it has, what should
be done to change it.” Dr. Leg
gett continued.

“The quality oi the evidence re
garding hall life is such that it
can only be measured by hearing

discussions from both points oi
view," he said.

Dr. Leggett noted that the resi-
dence hall problem had been a
topic of consideration at this year’s
encampment.

The reports at the encampment
committees, he said, have been
distributed to the executive com-
mitte of the faculty and iaculty
discussion groups have been set up
to consider the reports.

Campus Unrest

At the 48th annual meeting oi the American:
Council on Education last week in Washington, DC,
the main topic of concern was the proper role of stu-i
dents in the formation of university policy.

Two years ago on the Grinnell campus the main
topic of concern was the proper role of students in the
formation of college policy.

College administrators at the ACE meeting were
divided as to how much say the students ought to have.
One college president, for example, felt that students
ought to have a direct role in the selection of curricu‘
lum, while the dean of another school thought that stu-
dents had enough control of their curriculum just by
what they discussed in class.

The discussion at the ACE gathering sprang from
concern over student revolts at Berkeley and other uni—
versities during the last year.

Interestingly, the furor over rule changes subsided
at Grinnell about the time the Berkeley upheaval be~
gan. Nor has there been an upsurge in concern at
Grinnell recently.

‘ Perhaps the college worked out its turmoils satis-
factorily during its apparently premature display of
student unrest, Perhaps problems such as the possible
change in the residence hall system can now be con—
sidered with mutual respect for the opinions of all seg-
ments of the campus.

At any rate, President Glenn Leggett and Dean
James Stauss, who attended the ACE meeting from
Grinnell, must have found the discussion of student re-
volt in unusual contrast to the situation at their school.

Forum Windows

College administrators sometimes ask, in all sin-y
cerity, why it is that students are always cynical about
administration actions

Perhaps it is for little reasons, like not having the
windows of the Forum washed until a few days before
Homecoming and Parents’ Weekend despite the fact
they needed cleaning since the beginning of the school
year.

To the Editor:

Note: Barry Ancona, pres‘ out
of the Grinnell Religious Lil: ills,
was quoted last week as saying
at their meeting, “This is u liberal
campus only six days a week."
Dear Bari-y,

What precisely is illiberlll
about the seventh day around
here? I don't want to engage in
an “I‘m more liberal than you"
contest, but I do know as well as
you what liberalism ill religion
amounts to, and l can only regard
the statement attributed to you as
out of touch or reckless or both.
Malling such B remark as a stimu-
lus {or thought and discussion has
its appeal, but its inaccuracy makes
it self~defeatihg even as a stim~
ulus. The cause of liberalism in
religion is not Idvanced when the
apostles of liberalism make fool-
ish statements, even if those state-
~{Ijents sound liberal Ind iconoclas-
lc.

Our seventh day has its faults,

sliberalSevenlh

one of them being 8 Somewhat eXr
cessive liberalism and its blood
brother lntellecluallsm (vid Tom
Pope's remark in last Week's is~
sue). Did you hear the sermon “A
Natural Easter” 0r “Albert
Schweitzer on History"? 01‘ "The
Noise of Solemn Assemblies"?
Have you taken time to study the
format of the service, which has
been rather distinctively “lib-
cralized’” It may not all be as
liberal as you personally would
like ii, but i great number of oth-
el‘ people attending don't want it
as liberal as you do, and l have
believed that one of he hallmarks
or the liberal's position is generv
ous tolerance to other people's
viewpoints. The current Chapel
program favors the liberal view-
poini, and i should lhiuk that m-
ther than gratuitously knocking
it, you would take support when
you have it!

Vocal Referendum on Student Life
Features Five Minute ‘Sound Off'

By PAUL BRADLEY

A "Bitchvln on [he Multluniver-
sity," a vocal referendum on the
problems of student life, will be
held at the University of Colorado.
Modeled alter rho leachdns, the
bitch-in will be aimed at attacking
what the student thinks is wrong
with the university and how to
correct these problems.

There will be no formal speeches;
all comments will come d1-
rectly from the students. As each
student enters the auditorium, he
will receive a numbered IBM card
which he will be encouraged to
bend, (Old. Staple, or mutilate. In
numerical order, each Cardholder
will then have five minutes [0
sound all. The bllch—ln is not only
to allow the student “lo get it
off his chest" but also to provide
a set of goals and actions on Slur
dents' problems.

Alter months or debate the trus-
tees of Ohio State University have
altered the controversial speakers
ban ruling. Under the change in
the ruling OSU organizations will
be able to invite desired speakers
to the campus as long as their
laculzy adviser approves. Before
the change administrative approv-
al of invited speakers was re-
quired.

The ninemember board of trus-
tees approved the change in the
ldryearrold ruling by a four-lo-
three vote alter lwo of its meni-
bers, who previously decided a-
gainst [he bill, were absent from

When alterations in the ban were
voted down last March, student
leaders in the Free Speech From
began a protest movement on the
campus. In May the Free Speech

By DAVID LIGHTBOURNE

Although nobody bothers to men-
tion it as a theoretical propositlon,
this semester's calendar oi cultur-
al events could be one of the
brightest in recent years, and I’m
thinking specifically of certain new
directions in aesthetic experience
that are assuming a more impor-
tant role in our week-toweek sc-
Iivilies. What I'm talking about is
the increasing element at audience
participation lately, at certain at
our artistic events.

Now, it's common knowledge
that all Worthwhile aesthetic exa
periences are twoway proposi-
tions. that the mind responds in an
indlvtdual and creative way to or
tistic terms that manage to cap»
ture the imagination, What's less

irequentiy recognized, however, is
the value ot mass aesthetic re.
sponse by an entire audience.
when common grounds or excited
appreciation are openly and wide—
ly shared trom one member to the
next. Audiences have been doing
this sort oi thing since the earliest
beginnings o1 comic and tragic
drama, tor instance, and direct
audience participation during the
aesthetic act can accelerate lead-
ing tensions with a remarkable efa
iectiveness. A current example
which immediately comes to mind
is the ARI-I “King or the Rocket
Men" him-serial, which is getting
a lot or attention anyway, ot late,
as a symbol tor several ditierent
points oi VIEWt

One opinion, tor example, sees
all the interest and excitement in
this vintage Iormuta~romance as a
display oi “frivolous" sensibilities
and basically anti-intellectual
tastes. Grinnell students actually
take the filmrlnstallments serious
ly. because, th e i r “parasitic
minds" are evidently incapable or
any moreampitious undertakings.

Another view, will an obviously
more lenient streak, simply recog-
nizes a legitimate nostalgic rever-
ence tor the ongins ol the Ameri-
can “super" hero and openly ad—
mm the sentimentality of such an
attitude. Moreover, the Iilm is 50
dated in bath technique and detail
that the quaintly romantic speu ot
a younger, more innocent en be
comes altogether irresistible.

Neither ot these explanations it
actually acceptable. however, be-
cause neither of them match thl

brought the whole subject up, The
film is, in actuality, B classic 0!

gory ol art which sacririces nearly
all content tor the sake of a mu-

this disparity is all the more ob.
vinus and Ihux all the more abs
surd, but nevertheless accessible
as art to an audience which under-
stands the opportunities Ior ten<
sion in that disparity.

The theatre doors open and pe0<
ple pour out. There is a babble
or voices discussing the play they
have just seen. There are com-
ments on the beauty at the set.
The actors’ pertorrnances are torn
to shreds, and the impact and
meaning of the play are hashed
over. But beiore the opening our-
talnv helore the costumes, before
the set was built, helore anything
could happen, there was a play
and a director. And the director
called try-outs,

What are tryouts? Basically,
they are the choosing of the ac-
tors and actresses who will make
the play come to life. The evening
or the try-outs there is nothing but
a bare, dimly lit stage and the
director sitting on the stage facing
those hopeiul or getting a part. He
has in mind the kind of people
that he wants for the parts. He
must now listen to these people
to find the ones who will best Iulr
till his conceptions.

He gets their names. He stands
before the expectant laces and
tells them what the play is about.

he calls them to the stage in
groups of two or three and given
them a page and a character. The

and they reread the same pas-
sages Hopefuls read one part,
then another, They read against
one combination and then another.
some are dismissed immediately
and others are held For the whole
eventing. Finally, all have read.
All have been Classified. The di.
rector sends the aspirants away
and stays to go over and over his
notes trying to decide the tinal
cast.

But what about the try-outs from
the actors’ point of view? How do
they reel to walk into a barren
theatre, to sit in the seats they
usually face? How does it feel the
first time to enter a place that
usually the person enters only on
a performance night to see the
magic happen, with hopes or be«
ing part or that magic? “my

WlIS Auction Deemed Success as $9M Is Collected

By ALAN AXELROD

Well OKAAAYY! The \VUS auction
laturday night bruught in $914 for the
.World University Service and at the same
time provided an evening or iroliosorne en-
tertainment and gay abandon for some 400
,wacky cullege illnsters.

Goad times? You better believe it. The
bidding was SCI ﬁerce that there was talk
of rolling Out the fire hoses to cool off the
overly exuberant. One girl who tainted af-
ler losing out on a Wesson Oil party said
she had withdrawn her savings from the
Poweshiek County bank for the occasion
and was utterly crushed at gomg home
empty handed. _

Pl‘ofessiunal auctioneer Dick Seers gave
the auctibr; a genuine flavor and an hon—
est-to-goodness Osage lndlan, who was
spotting the bids, gave the auction some
Inure genuine flavor or a riliterent nature.

Prices ranged from $1.50 for ironing
service to $135 for President Leggett’s din-
nerr Other big attractions were a party by

 

the ireshman cheerleaders, which went for
$45; a Gates Hall Roman orgy, $56; a Scar
leteers’ pajama party, 540; and hreakiast
in bed served by the Cleveland girls, which
was lmally plucked by Tom Pope tor $39.

Perhaps the most controversial item at
the evening was the North Younker sere-
nade that inspired“a top bid of only $6.
George Witigrat opined, “It was a very
conservative bid." And house president
Nick Nonas’ only words were, “I were
shocked! We was robbedl”

The auction itself brought $871. The re-
mainiilg $43 was brought in by a jail spon-
sored by WRA, a car-smashing event spon-
sored by ROTC, and a turtle race that
would have seemed paradoxical to Zeno
himself.

Tile only important ingredient missing
was the tradlliunal carnival belore the auc-
(ions However, there was a gala rock ’n roll
dance preceding the auction. and of course,
as a once-famous man once said, “You
can’t bake a cake and also eat your bread.”

Report Describes Des Moines Proiecl

Ed. note: The following is a
description of the “Des ltloines
Project," which will be sup-
ported by several lowa colleges,
including Grinnell. Fifteen Grin-
ncll students have been in Des
ltloines to help on the project at
various times since September.

The traditional approach to the
problems of an economically (lea
privcd area,ignorcs the basic right
of people to have a voice in the
decisions which affect them.

First, the approach often fails to
ascertain either the needs of the
people or the type of program
which will work most effectively in
the area.

Secondly, because the community
has not bccn given a part in the
original formation of the program.
it resents or distrusts the purposcs
of those who are trying to start the
program. .

Finally, this approach may attack
results rather than causes, or one
aspect rather than the whole basis
of that which causes a slum.

Another approach, started in the
last tcw years by a series of dif

: feront groups ranging from Stun
E dents for a Democratic Society to

the inner-city church groups is
"cammuniLyrselfsurganization.” In
this approach fullrtime organizers
living in the arca work to draw
people together into a community
group. Their ultimate objective is
to start a working group which will
provide continuing leadership for
the area by the community people
themselves.

The difference between the com-
munity-selﬂnrganlzation and the
traditional approach is that the
former brings about a basic change
in the economically deprived area
both politically and psychologically.
Tile slum usually has very few
ways open to it for helping itself
due to the lack of political exper»
ience and influence Iound there.

 

The community organization, by
establishing the machinery and
knowledge for problemsolving by
the people themselves. modifics
their dcpcndencc on outside agen-
cics.

The community organization pro-
vides the means of self help and
communication with other coni-
munitics and groups which is so
desperately needed in these areas.

The communitysorganizing ap-
proach is the one which the Des
Moines Study Group hopes will be
put into eitcct in the Walnut Hill
area of Des illoinos. The program
will combine three working groups.

The first will be a full time or.
ganizer financially supported by
eastern and central lowa colleges.
The person who is now working in
this capacity is Billy King. who has
been living in the Walnut Hill are-a
and doing research on the prob»
lems, oi community organizing
there for one month.

Secondly, King will cooperate
with Youth for Freedom, a com.
ninnity organization in the area.

Thirdly, campus groups will take
part in the project when they are
asked to do so by the community
group. Youth for Freedom, or
King. Their participation may in-
volve research. work camps or our
or activity that the community
groups deem necessary.

The project has both academic
and cultural implications for col-
lege students, Observing and, at
times, participating in the prob-
lemssolving processes of the Wai-
nut Hill area can be extremely
valuable, They can gain both
practical political and sociological
experience. Furthermore. Contact
with a different cultural and econ
omic group can he personally. as
well as intellectually. beneficial.
However, student participation in
the project will occur only for the
benefit and at the request of those
in the area.

FCSA Begins Year;
Will Consider Policy

“The Faculty Committee on
Student Affairs sees its major du-
ty in the area of policy rather
than in specifics,” FCSA chairman
John Burma (sociong) said this
week.

Burma explained that he tel: his
committee this year would not
handle such matters as whether
women students should be allowed
to stay out do minutes later on
Friday nights, a concern which he
considers a technical detail.

“On the other hand, we would
be concerned with a possible
change in the hall system pol.
icy." Burma said.

Burma noted that the FCSA
has met only two times so far
this year and that no cases oi
student misconduct have been con-
sidered as yet.

The committee this year coni-
prises eight voting members, They
are Burma, Denis de Coteau
(music), James Kissane (Eng-
lish), Dirk Baay (German). Ken-
yon Knopi (economics), Jean Sloe
cum (dean of women). S. Eugene
Thompson (clean at man). and
Richard Winters (associate dean).

in addition to the eight voting
members, President Glenn Leg-
gctt and Dean James Stauss are
ex otticio members of the com—
mittee.

The FCSA drew attention to its
salt last school year during a
jurisdictional feud involving the
student courts and the college ad-
ministration.

The committee, which was es
tablished last year by acting
President James Stauss, advises
the president on policies in the
area of student conduct, particle
pates in the process of changing
the basic rules and penalties. and
considers certain cases or student
misconduct.

ship is among Grinnell's iresh<

negotiations could only begin at-
ter intervention from the North
ceased.

The Undersecretary oi State of
Cambodia answered Duc by stat-
ing the ”us intervention is the
only true intervention in South
Viet Nam." He also said that the
South could only make true sir
cial progress when all ioreign
troops were withdrawn and when
a government representative at
the people had been installed.

The third speaker, William Wor—
thy. said he appeared “not as a

spokesman” (or the NLF, although

he has traveled throughout South-
east Asia and has regular contact
with NLF representatives in Pro»
gue.

“Hanoi and the NLF have the
overwhelming majority ot maria
kind on their side,” according to
Worthy. He said that since 1954
the people or South Viet Nam have
had no voice in their governments.

Worthy also claimed that the
Johnson administration had res
fused to enter “ott-the-record"
talks with the NLF last year be-
cause or domestic political pres
sures during the elections.

The final speaker of the session,
Robert Scalapiuo, was interrupted

several times by shouts irom the
audience at Toronto. Some Stu-
dents were protesting the removal
of Michael Myerson from the list
of scheduled speakers.

Myel'son is a graduate student
at California where Scalapino
heads the political science depart-
ment. There was a rumor, yet
unconﬁrmed, that Scalapino had
refused to appear with Myerson,
who has recently returned trot-n
Hamil.

Scalapino said that the United
States must act in Viet Nam to
preserve the balance of power in
Southeast Asia. He advocated re-
cognizing the Viet Cong for pur-
poses of negotiation it necessary.

The panel on viet Nam was only
part of a three-day teach-in heiore

Friday. October l5, not

an audience of 4,500 at Toronto.
The Saturday morning session
dealt with u. s. policy toward Latin
America.

Grinnell was one of 28 colleges
in the US and Canada to receive
the teach~in by telephone hook-up.

tive of Scandinavian Seminar, will

Protessol's at St. John’s Univer-

the little participation they have
in the iorming of the school’s ed-
ucatlonal policy. The dispute be-
tween laciilty and administration

began during the student demon-
stration last spring at St. John’s
and grew when its new president,
Joseph Cahill, did nothing to pla-
cate the faculty.

After certain appointments were
made, not to the iacuity's lilting,
the American Association 0! Uni-
versity Professors met late in Au
gust and decided as a “minimum
action" In protest to picket. The
prolessors demand a University
Senate, tenure, a new salary scale,
and the election of departmental
chairmen. The proiessors on pick.

“Mom, this is it—the last straw.
Now they’ve melted my candy!
All of it." “Morn, you really must
come down for Parent's Weekend;
we’re boycotting the laundry and
I’m down to my last pair of
socks." Yup, in 1952 the Grinnell
boys really had it hard, and many
letters home may have contained
exerpts like these.

What was the problem? Well,
centralization — that omnipresent
phenomenon—was botcliing up the
works again. Somebody had der
cided that it would be convenient
to have the laundry, cleaning, and
parcel post agencies located in one
building—the heating plant. Many
others decided that it wouldn't be
convenient at all. Thus. the Iuss.

On October 3, 1952, the 5&3
wrote that “the Grlhnell Student
Council unanimously approved a
resolution for a collegewide boyr
coil of the college laundry and
dry-cleaning agency. . . .Reasoiis
oriered by council members Im‘
the unprecedented boycott are that
the present location or the clean-
ing, laundry, and parcel post agen.
cies is inconvenient and relatively
inaccessible during the muddy
months; that the new centraliza-
tion or these serVices is depriving
students or Jobs; that the lack oi
adequate space and tacilities in
the heating plant creates a bot-
tleneclt during the lunch hours;
and that heat of the building has
led to the spoilage oi iood pan
Eels." One can Imagine hundreds
or students struggling through rain
and Wind and sleet and hall to
retrieve packages lmm home and
laundry and bundles oi dry»clean-
lug—only to drop every bit of it

 

in the mud. They did have a real
complaint. one must admit.

Tile edltorial staff of the 5&3
determined to present both sides
of the issue. however, They wrote,
“When the decision- was made to
combine. services at the heating
plant, there seemed to be advan-
tages tor both the students and the
housekeeping department. For the
students, it would mean a chance
to pick up packages any time dur-
ing the working day. At the same
time, it would eliminate unneces-
sary handling, ireeing trained
laundry personnel irom timecori-
suming tasks.” On the other hand,
“it is a tact, too, that the heat of
the laundry plant has melted can~
dy mailed to students." Clearly,
this was a hot issue.

However, two weeks passed and
the boycott (which, the editor-
said, “has nothing to do with boys
or cots although the confusion is
qulte understandable at this time
or the year") wasn’t put into ei—
Iect. The 5&3 queried, "Since the
Council vote was unanimous, it
appears that representative stu-
dent opinion is likewise unanl-
mous. Why, then, are students
still patronizing the college agen-
cies which they have just legis-
lated against?" Maybe that three-
ieet high pile oi shirts was just
too much to tight.

Grit/men Meet Monmouth After Overcoming Knox 21-8

last Minute Score
Snatches Victory

By STEVE CASEY

The Pioneer football team will
be iacmg a big test this home-
omiiig weekend as it faces Mon-

)Duth, a team that is also 2-],

no they should be in a tough
hand after being dropped from
the unbeaten ranks last week by
Ripon.

The Scots field a team that is
very similar to the Pioneers as
far as records go. Both have beat-
en Cornell by one point—Mom
'n'iouth, 19-18, and the Pioneers
al-zo—and both have just barely
oqueaked by a weak team in the

nierence—Monmouth over St. O<
at 745 and the Pioneers last week

ith a tough 21-8 victory over
nox. Finally both have been beat-

n by Ripon—the Pioneers 274)
and Monmouth last week 17—6.

two Pioneer touchdowns and an
interception helped snatch a Vic»
tot-y from what almost appeared
to be a disheartening loss.

8-7 Deficit

With only 3:21 leit in the game
Knox had tinaily broken through
the tough Pioneer defense to score,
and when they converted on the
Espnint pass, they turned what had
seemed a fairly safe 7o Pioneer
lead into an 8-7 deficit. But the
Pioneers drove so yards after the
kickoii to paydiri with 52 seconds
remaining. Then after the kickoff,
on the second play the Pioneers
intercepted a pass and returned it
to the tour yard line from which
they scored again with 27 seconds
remaining.

When the game started, the Pio-
neers looked like they were really
going to drive at will. After the
kickoff on the second play, Bob
Watt went around end for 23
yards on a reverse, Then one play
later Watt went eight yards for
a first down on the Knox 32. Here
the Pioneers got a break as Tom
Hill pounced on the tumble of one
of the Pioneer halibacks. But af»
ter illegal procedure and offsides
penalties, the pioneer rally tip
zled out.

Thurston Steals Bull

The Pioneer defense got in
though and immediately
got the ball back as Paul Thurston
stole it from the Knox halfback.
But the offense got nowhere. After
two exchanges oi punts, the Pio-
neers picked up the ball again on
their 42. Then on two plays Jolm
Shierholz lugged the bail to the
Knox 28.

But as the second quarter began
the Pioneers lost 12 yards on a

After another series at punts, the
Pioneers started a drive on the

to the 35, Rich Weeks ran the
hall to the 19 with 1:44 left in the
half. But the offense again ran out
of gas and Knox took over, A pass
interference call and a pass
brought the ball to the Pioneer 13
with 28 seconds remaining. But
the Pioneer defensive line, led by
Jim Moore, Ken Augustine, and
John Lawson, combined to smear
the quarterback on the next two
plays. Knox then tried a field
goal, but it was way short.

Second Half Fire

The Pioneers came out in the
second half with fire in their eyes,
After Knox returned the kick to
the 20, Moore, Dick Lamb, and
Lawson tackled the Knox quarter-
back on the 17. On the next play
Lawson's tackle forced a tumble
which Knox recovered on their
eight. Atter the Knox punt came
out to the 39 and the Pioneers had
advanced the ball to the 35, John
Shierholz went for the first score
on a reverse behind some beauth
in] blocking, Paul Thurston’s kick
was good and Grinnell had a 7—0
lead with 11:40 left in the third
quarter.

But through the rest of the third

 

punts, Knox got the ball on their
33 with 6:30 left in the game. They
quickly drove to the Pioneer 20.
Then they were forced back to the
31 on a fumble. But two plays
later the Knox quarterback lofted
a perfect pass to the Slwasher end
who was tackled at the two yard
line There they scored on quarter-
back sneak. After the extrarpoint
pass was completed, Knox held
the 8»7 lead with 3:21 left.

Clipping Penalty

After a clipping penalty on the
kickoff forced the Pioneers hack
in the ii, they started a drive. A
Barry Anderson pass to Dave Syn-
horst brought the ball to the 30.
Two plays later Anderson ran for
a first down to the 441 After two
plays brought the bell to the 49,
Anderson was tackled back at the
40 bringing up a tourth down and
ten. Then John Shierholz took a
screen pass and weaved his way
to the first down with 1:59 rc<
mainingr After a Knox penalty,
two incomplete passes, and it run,
the Pioneers were faced with a
fourth and five. Here Anderson
fired a pass that was partially de-
flected, but Tom Hill still grabbed
it for a first down on the 23. Shier-

holz then lugged the ball to the
14. After an incomplete pass, Bub
Watt streaked through a gaping
hole in the Knox line, broke [U
the outside, and beat the siwash
secondary to the goal line, Thur-
ston again converted to give the

Pioneers a 14’s lead.

On the second play after the
kickoff, Walt intercepted Knox
pass near the 40 and returned it
to the four, from which Shierholz
scored on the next play with 21
seconds remaining to give the Pio-
nears the 21-3 victory.
