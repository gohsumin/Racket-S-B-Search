Senate Passes i
‘No Tesl' Plea

by Paul Samuel

Standingsroomronly is the;
word which describes room 125
ot the Science building last Mon
day night as the Student Son.
ate roiod 2947 in tavor oi a
resolution opposing the riestlmps
tioii oi atmospheric nuclear test-
ing hy the United States.

The resolution Was a rewr ‘
ten version M the one which:
had been presented to the Sens
ate on Nov. 2 and which had,
been taken back to the halls fort
consideration by hall members i
The language of the old resolu-
tion had been cleared up and.
made less flowel‘y‘ but to all

intents and purposes, the resolu-‘ .

tion was the same.

 

The resolution consists of foul"
parts—tact, principle, declaration[
and mandate. The declarationl

proposes that “We, the Studenti

Senate of Grinnell College, op
pose resumption of atmosph

to nuclear testing by the Unit-
ed states," (An amendment

phrase. y a Vote of . to

after "Grlnnell College, ) l

The mandate empowers “the
appropriate student govern-
ment oiiicers to send copies at
this resolution to such deiense
and military oiiicials as the
president, Secretary of De-
icnse, the Secretary of Health.
Education and Welfare, the
Joint Cliiers oi Stati and the
Chairman oi the Atomic Encr—
gy Commission." 2

These officers are furtherl
empowered “on ,belialt of the
Student Senate ot the Student
Government Association to ex-l
press the decision at the Senate‘
on this matter as they see ﬁt."

Quizzed as to What the words
“as they see fit" meant, SGA
president Bill Halamzt explained)
that the Student Government

l
Association planned to seek ins;

ter 'ews with important state
otticials and possibly to hold a‘
“press conference" which might
be picked up by the wire serv-i
iccs. He said hc hoped the idea
would then snowball to other

colleges across the country. 1

Debate on the resolution, lastr
ing more than two hours, was
restrained and wellspresentedl
Senate Speaker Cameron Hen—
dershot characterized the debate
as “the finest that l have ever
seen since 1 took ottice."

Arguments tor and against ‘

Student Action

Grinnell has been alive this week in a way that is en—
couraging to sec. There has been debate and resolution,
much confusion and solnc v ry courageous decisions and
action. If the world outside looks discouraging and blacker
perhaps than ever before in the history of mankind, Grin—
hell’s activity and the awakening of the American student
is significant as a slnall ray of hope and some testimony
to the fact that perhaps there are still some realities to be
found between and beneath the lines and lines of deified
facts.

of all the very fine debating we heard in the Scri-
ate, there was one point of View which is still a lingering
incongruity to this week of awakening, Even after the
Grinnell College Senate last year set the precedent 01‘ john
ing the NSA, and becoming one of its lnost active members,
even after a protest was registered against the U2 incic
(lent, several members of the Senate are still pleading long,
hard and strong for Senate isolationism.

The argument which seems most illogical, is one which
might be called the argument for specialization. That is,
that students ill the Senate should be restricted to a nalu
row line of thinking and legislation defined very narrowly
by the words “student life.”

Student life may be interpreted in two ways. It may
lie construed to mean simply concern over the workings
of coke machines, milk machines, Grinnell concerts and what
have you on the Grinnell campus, or it may be construed
to mean anything which will effect the student ill all im-

>ortant way,

It is interesting to note that even though Senators
Capehart and Humphrey were not in agreement with stands
taken by the senate resolution. they felt that student ac-
tion in a democratic system was of primary importance.
Students should try to lnake themselves heard.

Petition, in itself, is something 01’ a show of Faith in
the American systemi It is when we begin to be so very
sure that we will not be heard and that we have nothing
to say, that our system of government is in grave jeopard .
Part of being a student is contributing our knowledge and
opinions to the world about us -

Furthermore, it is becoming more and more
apparent that in this crisis-time there are very
few things that happen in the world which do not directly
or indirectly effect the student. Strontium 90 in the at-
mosphere will strike the student, the national and’oi'
world citizen, it will not be selective. Student activity is
{rill-important today. We must act, and we must act in a
courageous and united fashion if we are to be heard.

Thirteen Travelers

Thirteen people will travel to Washington this week
for a three day vigil in hope of arousing student opinion :1—
against the resumption of nuclear testing in the atmosphere
Regardless of how you may feel about the issue itself, it
seems important only to remind the student body that it
is this sort of action which must be considered of a noble
and courageous nature.

legardless of final effectiveness, the effort itself is one

to be admired, because it shows that the American student

is finally leaving the provincialism of his own small back-
yard and venturing out to take his place as a conscientious

citizen of the world.

To the Editor:

We are not only looking to
perfect wcapcns or an olrciisii-c
nature by the resumption oi nu-
clear testing which would have
the ciicct of disarming the So-
viets in case 01 wa'. Mcrc ““7
portant and primal ly, we are
at this minute in a race to buikl
up a strong defense against
potential Russian aggression.

The defenses l have specific-
ally in mind are the antim ln
mlssilcs of the proposed Ni \er
Zeus Caliber which would help to
secure both protection against
missile threats as well as to in—
sure our missrlo effectiveness in
case of conﬂict.

What good would our ebborate
missiles be if wc could not in-
sure any hits in case of attack?
It has admittedly been stated
that both the US 5.12, and the
US, have enough nuclear wcapr
oils on hand to destroy each
other. Should we, through nog-
ligence, rail to develop our der
fensive arsenal, we would be

admitting a dcicci by‘dcicull.

The Russians do not have
miy nppircnr designs along
this line. Surely they realize

the importance of prcicciing
their own populations (if only

ior propaganda's sake) as went
as realizing the importance or
developing weapons which
could disable America.

It Seems we are again in a
race with the SovietUnion only

this time to see who can develop
the most efficient weapons to
preserve our civilian popular
tions.

These weapons. although
small, would oi necessny be
both aiinospheric in use and
nuclear in nature They must be
atmospheric for they are design—
ed to deslroy other niis les.

RESOLUTHON DIRECTED TO STUDENT SENAT .

(November 6, 1961)
Fact:

The Sol/let Union has recently conducted a Series of 17 atmoSA
phcric nuclear tests climaxed by an explosion of greater than 50
megatons as or October 31, 1961. Now the US. is seriously ccn-
sidcrmg a resumption oi atmospheric nuclccr testing.

Military experts chine United States have repeatedly asserc
ed that We could “destroy any enemy who attacks us regardless
or when or how he does it," (Arleigh Burke or the JOlnt Chieis of
Sara bciorc a Congressional Committee) * And President Kennedy
himself has stressed the utter usclcssncss of the recent Soviet
series

Many physicists, doctors, biologists. and health ciiicinls have
offered ccncrclc, positive evidence or the grotesque consequences

sion to icrccs which threaten human survival have traditionally

with an equal conccrn for the international posture of the us.
that we assume lhc following position.

Declaration:
We, the Student Senate of’Grinnell College, by a vote of 29-17
gppose a resumption of atmospheric nuclear testing by the United
(ates.

Mandate:

' The appropriate student government officers are empowered
to send ccpics of thls resolution to such defense and military
criicinls as the President, Secretary of Defense: the Secretary of
Health, Education and Weliarc; the Joint Chiefs of Shirt; and the
chairman of ihc Atomic Energy Commission. Thcsc officers are
iurihcr empowered on behalf of the Student Senate or the sup
dent chcrnmcnl Assomatlon to express the decision or the Sen-
ate on this matter as they scc fit

“ Also, Roswell Gilpatrie, “This nation has a nuclear retaliatory
force of such lethal power that any enemy move which brought
it into play could be an act of selfrdestruction on his part. Our
forces are so displayed and protected that. a sneak attack Could
not effectively disarm us.” (Oct., 1961)

your Washington vigil, fine, but
there IS nothing more embarras-

Your demonstration or con-
corn is not going to put much
pressure on the Senate, House
or the President. I think the
show put on by. Capcharl and
Humphrey demonstrated admir-
ably that the glib tongues of
the politicians can reduce any
argument to absurdity, There is
no hope of asking the President
or his underlings questions for
which they have no answers,

Make rhc Washington vigil a
demonstration at your concern
about the acceleration of the
aims race, the proposed resump-
tion of nuclear testing and the
lack of _ gniiicant action in the
field of dlsﬂi‘lnﬂi‘nent Make the
demonstration an effort to arouse
interest in what is thought. to be

a sittltalon oi immediate danger
As for your methods, keep

them as simple as your purposes.
One of the most impressive pacir

risl demonstrations was the
silent vigil maintained around
the pentagon: just an orderly
circle of people standing wilh
their heads bowed as if in prayer
or sorrow, Don't rule out last-
mg complclcly; it would save
money and the total cost is go~
ing to be around $700.

Above all, tell us what you
are going to do. Explain care-
fully your position, your mo-

tives and your course of MA

terest but iolow it up after
you return.

If things turn out as 1 hope,
we might cvcn be able to drum
up some support here on campus
Perhaps, in conjunction With

of voluntary fast to show that
we too, are concerned.

Then, done in

Debate Senate Decis'en 0n Atmospheric Tests

To the Editor:

1 tear that the reckless resolution on atmospheric testing pass—
ed by our Student Senate will display loi- public view an example

0! rash and emotional (lectston.

This Student Senate has milder

quatc knowledge of both the ialleut facts and the deiense con. el-

el‘alions which must be included
ing.

in any decision on nuclear tes

The said resolution will reflect little Credit on the students of
this college who as persons of intellect and education should know
better than to condemn out oi ignorance and fear,

The resolution implies that regardless of what strategic gains
the Soviet Union has derived irom its recent series at tests. these
gains do not necessitate a resumption oi atmospheric testing by
the United States 1 can only ask on what grounds the Senators
base this implication, toi- even our nuclear experts have not yet
had enough time to evaluate what progress the Soviet Union made

in these tests.

Should ottr nuclear scientists decide that Russian gains

in

these tests endanger the effectiveness of our deterrent nuclear
force, and our pl‘eSldent Consequently deCldes that we can no
longer avoid atmospheric tests without endangering;r national se-
curity, I feel that we should be moved by this consideration of
our national defenskover considerations of world opinion and
over fears of possible danger from radioactive fallout.

“Fear," President John F. Kennedy has stat‘

d. “is the oldest

weapon in history. Throughout the liie of mankind it has been
the resort of those who could not hope to prevail by reason and
persuasion. it will be repelled today as it has been repelled in
the past—not only by the steadiastncss oi irce men, but by the
power oi arms which men will use to deicnd freedom."

The resolution states that an aversion to forces which threaten

human survrval

has traditionally characte 'ch Grlnnell.

I can

only hope that an aversion to forces which threaten American
security shall also traditionally characterize Grmnell.

To The Editor:

The iollowing quote from a
pamphlet by Harrison Brown
and James Real, published in
1060 and entitled “Community
of Fear,” bears relevance to ac-
tion that Grinnell is now pre—
paring to take. It might be well
to consider our actions with re-
garol to the tone of this passage.

“The Soviet Union has appai»
ently, in the last iew years, in-
stituted a civilan defense pro—
gram oi substantial magnitude.
It is probable that within the
next two or three years the
United States will embark on a
crash shelter program for a
large proportion of its citizens
and some oi its industry, Once
the shelter program is undei»
way, it will consitute a signifi-
cant retreat irom the idea of
the obsolescence of war.

Once the people are convinc—
cd that they can survive the
present state of the art of
killing. a broad and niticant
new habit pattern wrll have
been introduced and accept»

To the Editor:

In response to the question
“How can we iustiiy atmospher-
ic tests in view or the fact that
we have many times over
enough megatons to obliterate
Russi. .

Russia's testing of nuclear
weapons in the high yield range
was declared irresponsible be
cause there is no strategic need
to test bombs oi this yield as
a much lower level yield will
cliectively destroy strategic tar—
gets; secondly, it was irrespon-
sible in that the maximum ra-
dius oi the tireball extended be-
low ground level needlessly. (A
surlace blast is inherently dirty;
an air blast is dirty tothc e.
tent of the fission trigger and
vaporized bomb case)

Russia's largest fusion bomb
was obviously (and irresponsib-
ly, i agree) detonated as a show
oi iorce, with the extremely
high iallout level utilized to
make this show of’force even
more iear ispiring No one can
say whether the other lower
yield detonations were uselc
except Russian scientists who in—
tcl‘ln’el the results. We must as
suine that 1, they achieved val-
uable data from these bursts,
and 2, they have obviously
achieved a tear reaction in the
world (or at least on this came

pus).

These assumptions are based
on 1, the tact that any data
from a bomb adds to the store

that the only lasting cure tor

The latter is our moral obligaz

To the Etlitn .

“These ci-e the times which
try men‘s souls.”

The resumption or nuclear
tests by Russia and the present
possibility oi the same by the
US has not resulted in Wider

~c till/,ed society" generally
trouns upon outbreaks of emo—
lthn or extreme dedication to

instead, we are cautioned on
all sides to control our tempc s.
repress nonconiormist opinions,
and avoid behavior which indi-
cates clearly our position on any
crucial subject. Yet, America is
reacting powei-iully to the pos—
sibility of nuclear testing and
war.

Grinncll students have been
revealing in their actions. Cone
sider the most prevalent reac—
tion. On Monday evening Stu-
dents lost countless hours or
study time while participating
in bull sessions about the nowe
passed Student Senate resolu-
tion,

Common to these bull ses-
sions were bitter jokes and
wry comments in rcicrcnce to
.the international situation;
everything iroin a cheery
“See ya in Berlin" to nervous
laughter over n ”Punch" car—
tooii in AK“.

John Ward gave us another
rcatllollithe sobering thought
oi the results of the war and
the realization of the irightene
ing mortality oi man.

beiore hoiisemeetings to encour—
age support for the Student
Senate resolution. (The lack of
any indication of its origin
rubbed the wrong way.) In the
housemeetmgs serious students,
over 75 per cent of the student
body, voted 455—355 in tavor oi
the resolution. ,

As is the custom in democrat
ic societies, the representative
body then discussed the resoluv
tion i ~ several hours, However,
this discussion was unusually
solemn and restrained as they
attempted to discuss an emo-
tlollsrlddlcd (moral? strategic?
illl‘ldel'llne your choice) issue,
The Senate then voted 2047
against resumption of atmos—
pheric nuclear testing.

Even more reactions. A signif-
icant number of students are
leaving today ior Washington,
DC, on a hunger strike protest
against the testing. These peo-
ple are not showoiis; they are
not “beatniks” (a stupid word
anyway), They are serious, scn<
silivc people with a real aware—
ness at the possible tragedy
awaiting our high~powered civ-
ilization.

And further, two students,

To the Editor:

a couple, quietly walked
around the north side or the
town making a total oi nine
interviews regarding the test—
ing and the cold war. One
man didnt know that itussin
had exploited a 50 imegnton
bomb.

Another had read in a news
magazine that the US. was can
pable of obliterating Russia,
and he was in iavor oi getting
it over with. A third person, a
woman babysitter, i-eiused to
consider the question. She
wouldn’t listen to the radio, read
the papers or discuss it. All in-
terviewed iavcred resumption of

Mor Saturday evening a stu-
dent in a bull session said, “I

it is this last reaction, the
denial oi reality, which scares
me most For it is these people
who will commit suicide when
their ialse world is shattered
Steiner says this in “La Dolee

society!” (because they are il-

directly to this point (the state-
ment is paraphrased). “The re
iiisal to question who 1 am and
why I act is a denial oi a
man's basic humanity and a re—
lusal to enter into the genuine
educational process" For the
student at Grinnell this point
is terribly urgent as was evie
denced by the complete atten—
tion of the congregation.

Not only students. but all
men are being forced by the
slow realization of the growing
threat to their artiﬁcial peace
to view themselves and then
act according to what they
really see when the artiﬁce is
removed,

These are truly times which
try men’s souls.

Steve Aldrich

To the Editor:

These are upsetting times _
times, indeed, which burden peo-
ple’s souls, Perhaps this explains
the iact that so many people
are going apc on the question
or peace.

Peace is won, it at all, by
those who are patient, quiet and
poi-severing, not by demagogucs,
not by wild sacrifices, but by
measured activity.

Therefore, let us who want
peace, be not so bold as to sit
on Kennedy’s lawn, or to rally
all to the cause oi peace,

Let us begin by winning peace
within ourselves, This means
courage and cominittinent to
ourselves, our iellows, and our
God.

Michael Coburn

The recent action oi thc Student Senate in resolving to oppose
the resumption oi atmospheric nuclear testing is undoubtedly one
that raises questions in many minds, Yet, it is so morally and
logically iustitiable that it demands the support oi the Griniicll

student body as a whole.
In the lust place, it is evident

from the remarks of the Deputy

Secretary at Defense. Roswell Gilpatric, that we are now in a
position to destl' v Soviet Russia and indeed the whole world
with our present .tockpile of atomic weapons
Why then. the question arises, must we endanger health and i

crease tensions by testing atomic weapons we do not need? Are
we so callous that we feel we must “keep up with the Joneses"
even in the held at atomic testing?

What good are a billion megatons of bombs it the 28,000
megatons we now have are more than sufficient to make a fune

oral pyl'o of the entire worlizl'.7

The explanation oi some that we are attempting to periect

a “Clean neutron bomb” and that

this is the reason [or the testing

is not in itsell' a logical argument.

We do not know ii this is the purpose oi the proposed tests
or how many “dirty” tests would be required to periect a clean
bomb. Furthermore, regardless oi what type of tests are conduct—
ed, an unhealthy increase in world tensions is bound to result.

lt, however, we wish lor a moment to be purely scliish let
us consider the eitect oi a resumption of tests on the world at
large, The reaction oi the other nations ol the world can only
be that the Unltcd States is little better than the Soviet Union.

We will lose not only the respect oi some oi the nations com—
mitted to our cause, but we also will endanger our position with
respect to the neutral countries of Asia and Atrica who are fast

becoming disillusioned with our

lack of principle.

The resumption of atomic testing then will not only hurt us,
but lose the respect that we have gained by thus far not follow-

ing the Russians.

In iaet there exists no good reason for resuming atomic test-
ing. On the,Contral'y, We Will only hurt ourselves and the world
by an action inspired out of fear instead of reason.

Ray onsticld

To the Editor: ,

On Thursday, November 2, 1
brought bciore the Senate the
resolution in opposition to a r e
sumption oi nuclear atmospheric
testing by the United States. At
that time the Senate voted 24719
to delay consideration or the
issue.

At that meeting I also made
a statement concerning the res
olution. This statement has been
condemned as excessively emo<
tional, untrue and based on pre~
judlce rather than on tact.

It could well be that people
have been emotional on this
issue. But atter all it is an emo—
tional issue, Radioactivity in—
,iures human beings and radio~
activity may Wall take its toll
in lives. What )5 my evidence?

Others, besides Linus Pauling,
have made statements concem<
ing the dangers oi radioactive
iallout. A United Nations re-
port says, “An estimated total
oi 25,000 to 150,000 cases oi l'eue
kemia will ultimately occur, if
tests are stopped in 1953, irom
tests already held . . . An eStl<
mated total ot up to 100,000
genetic detects will occur over
subsequent years irom tests 314
ready held.” (Table ll, page 42,
UN Report on Radiation).

As regards Carbon—lo, a reA
port prepared by the Atomic
Energy commission concludes
that bomb tests to Sept. 1958,
would cause 100,000 gross
physical or mental detects,
350,000 cases oi stillbirths and
childhood deaths, and 900,000
cases at embryonic and neona—
tal deaths irom this cause
alone (“The Biological Hazard
to Man of Carbon-ll irorn Nu-
clear Weapons").

Nobody knows for certain
exactly what the effects of ra-
diation are, But there is more
than substantial evidence oi
drastic consequences indeed.

It is important that every Stu-
dent on this campus understands
What this resolution is not. It

is not a proposal for unilateral
disarmament. it does not in any
way condemn underground test
ing. And no, it does not “ade
cate crawling to Moscow on our
hands and knees."

We must understand the his-
torical context in which the
United States decision to test
or not to test will be made. it
will occur in the midst of a very
touchy Berlin situation. Secre-
tary of State Rusk has called
the Berlin situation one oi up-
ward escalation. Upward escala-
tion oi tear, at challenge and
ot threats. The Soviet Union has
decided to continue this esca1a<
tion. What will ours be?

Several members or the Senate
urged a resumption ot tests on'
the ground that the United
States could periect an antimic-
sle missle and in so doing im-
prove the defensive capacity oi
the US, But these persons also
said that it would take four
years to perfect such a device.

In the next tour years, ,
wouldn't you rather see some
real steps taken toward achiev—
ing universal peace? Or would
you rather see each side
buildup a system or deicnsive
devices which would make
them more willing than ever
to hurt invcctivcs, challenges
ultimatiims bark and forth?

Last week Nikita Khruschev
was quoted as saying that the
Soviet Union is now iinished
with tests and will stay tinished
until and unless the United States
tests and will stay iinishcd un—
begins testing. 1 do not think

that there is a person on this

U. Senator

said, is “How may we bette utis

he said, he would attempt to

which might shed light on my;
views oi American liberalism," ,

“The liberal today repre. s

And, he pointed out, “the can-

“All Americans agree on cer-

Debate Legali’ry Oi Resolul'ion

A debate on the constitution-
ality oi the resolution passed by
the Senate during its Monday
night meeting was held Tuesday
night in Cowles lounge between
SGA president Bill nalama and

Cowles freshman Phil Johnson.‘

The debate, somewhat impromp-
tu, was witnessed by almost 10
men.

Johnson, speaking for the neg-
ative. emphasized that by its
decision, the Senate had violate
ed the preamble of the SGA
Constitution, which states that
the SGA ”shall administer and
legislate rules pertaining to those
aspects at student life not
specifically reserved by the pies-
ideni,”

By acting in this way, the Sena
ate has made of itself a pres
sure group, Johnson said. Furth-
ermore, it is violating minority
rights by using both its influ-
ence and its money (which in
part belongs to the minority)
for interviews and press eon-
rerences, while the minority has
no chance to do so.

Kalama, speaking tor the ai-
iirmalive, emphasized t h a t

Sandwiched in between the
opening statements and the re-
buttals, members oi the audir
‘ence were allowed to direct
questions at Johnson and Hala—
ma, both singly and together.

one slight dramatic how.

in Zola's hook the daughter,

When John Hartung gained 189 yards last; week against
St. Olaf, he passed two milestones. His season total of 834
yards surpassed the Grinnell record of 745 yards in one
season and the 1798 yards he has gained during the past
three years means he has ground out over a mile of yard-

age in his career at Grinnell.
