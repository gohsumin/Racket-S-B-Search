The State of Iowa's Attorney General,
the City of Grinnell's police force, and
Grinnell College’s administration have
made separate moves concerning the
“Playboy” demonstration of Feb. 5, and
Pterodactyl, the underground newspaper.

A four-man team from the State
Capitol, headed by Assistant Attorney
General, Lawrence seekington, and in-
cludhig Grinnell graduate Jim Hughes,
arrived in Grinnell at approximately
2:00 PM. on Tues, Feb. 11. All mem<
bers of the team are under 25 years
of age. Local Chief of Police Peters
and the college administration both
stated that they had no previous knowl-
edge of the arrival or these men.
one or the group paid a short visit
to President Leggett at approximately
2-30 informing the president of their
’ l and intentions to investigate.
They rapidly made contact with St
dents and gathered inIormation con-

cerning the demonstration and Pteru-
dactyl. ’

Upon discovering the investigator’s
presence upon campus, S.G.A. members,
including Student Coordinator Tom Trip-
lett and SGA President Tom Thomas,
distributed a mimeo to inform students
of the situation. KDlC, the college radio
station, also kept the students informed.
At this time the Attorney General’s men
had made no requests to the college for
information. Tuesday night, members of
the team were seen in the Forum,
dressed in casual clothes. Later that
night, one member of the group at-
tempted to get into the East Street Gal-
lery to see Henry Wilhelm. He was re»
fused entrance.

Wednesday, the men informed the
Dean or Students, Alice Low, that her
iiles Were to be subpoenaed, when she
initially declined to give them any in-
tonnation The group reinsed any in-

"a or the radio

station, saying they would have to wait

 

Dedn Siouss Retires

Innovator Steps Down

At a special taculty meeting last Fri-
day, Dr. James H. Stauss, dean of the
college and provost since 1960, an<
nounced his resignation effective at the
end of this academic year. His an-
nouncement came at the end of a Come
prehensivo report on educational mat-
ters, which included recommendations
ror important academic changes.

Dr. Stauss told the faculty: “Ten
years of deaning are a long time. My
reason for ending it should be clear:
that is, ten years are enough. This is
the case not only from my own stand-

oiut, but also from the college’s need
or the freshness of ideas and energy
that aging after ten years in the office
cannot adequately supply. I look for-
ward to burning the candle at one end
Ditty."

President Leggett told the Scarlet and
Black that he will appoint a successor
to Mr. Stauss from either inside or out<
side the college, although he would pre-
hr to fill it with someone who is well
acquainted with the working of the col.
lege. He has asked both iaculty and
ntudents to give him recommendations.
Speculation for Mr. Stauss’ successor as
dean currently centers around Mr. Jar
peph Wall, chairman ot the faculty, Mr.
Waldo Walker, chairman of the Science
Division, and Mr. Alan Jones, chairman
of the History Department, although al-
most any faculty member, as well as
someone with the college could become
dean. It is also possible that the positions
of dean of the college and of provost
may not be held by the same person,
dependent on who is selected as dean.

in his last report to the faculty on
academic matters Dean Stauss gave a
history of the academic changes that
have occurred in his tenure, and pre-
sented some recommendations for some
far reaching academic changes. He is
known to have recommended that Inde-
pendent Study 397-398 include only actual
library or laboratory research, and that
Independent Study 187-198 and 297-298

be created to cover other activities, such
as choir and orchestra and innovative
courses. He recommended that Social
Studies be made into a two semester
“great contemporary problems" course.
Mr. Stauss also urged a review of ott
campus study, perhaps leading to a half-
ycar “work semester.” One of Mr.
Stauss’ major recommendations was a
complete revamping of admissions pol-
icy regarding black students.

As dean and provost, Mr. Slauss has
wide responsibilities over academic mat-
ters, particularly the content of the aca-
demic program and the deaning of the
faculty. His responsibilities cover the
recruiting and rehiring of faculty, over-
all supervision of faculty standing com-
mittees, supervision over the Registrar,

“one or two days." However, a phone
conversation with Mr. Seckington and a
short interview with one of his men
who came to campus Wednesday, re-
vealed that they expect to complete the
tirii stage of their investigation by the
end of the week, when they will turn
their intormati'on over to the proper
authorities. They di t care to com-
ment on the possib es oi prosecu-
tion, the range or their probe, or the
reasons for it.

, Douglas Carlson, Assistant At-
torney General said Thursday that
the Dean of Students, Alice Low,
would be subpoenaed early next
week for information related to
their investigation. Mrs. Low de-
clined to comment on the nature
of the information requested by
the investigators, but said, “l felt
. it was Confidential and I should
not release it ‘L it a subpoena.”
The College is cooperating with
the investigators as much as possi-
ble,, but as Mrs. Low explained,
“Professionally i cannot give out
information and would not do so
without 8 court order." The Col-
lege cannot stop a law eniorcement
agency from investigating a legal
matter but can control how much
they feel free to disclose until legal
action demands more information.

Thursday, the group attempted to con<
tact the alleged demonstrators, as well
as Henry Wilhelm, and Neil Fisher.
Fisher and his Nominate Greg Schmidt
agreed to talk to them while the demon-
strators refused their “ofﬁcial request”
to discuss the incident. The students in-
volved are arranging for legal consul-
tation.

Also on Thursday, the Aitomey Gen—
eral‘s men released a press statement.
The only stated goal of their investiga-
tion was the Playboy protest.
The release also denied reports that
their investigation was politically in-
spired. Their only goal is to discover
it the law has been violated.

The police asked several students to

 

Implications of Demonstration

By DAVID BRYAN

Events of the past week have tended
to place the focus of the February 5
demonstration against Playboy Maga-

zine into one of two fictionalized worlds
— the overly-simpiilieo world of the cov-
erage given by the media, or the limited,
legalistic world of certain concerned
Iowa legislators and Iowa Attorney
General, Richard "turner. However, if
the demonstration’s worth is to be real-
ized on campus, the intentions of the
demonstrators and reactions of the rest
of the college community need to be
known, and, most important, the impli-
cations ot the demonstration must be
kept alive.

Participants in the demonstration have
issued two statements in all attempt to
clarify the rationale of their protest. on-
ginally, when it was learned that a re
presentative of Playboy would be on
Campus to speak, members of the We
men’s Liberation Movement and Guerril-

la Theater groups on campus discussed
action which could be taken to show
opposition to the values espoused in
Playboy. It was hoped that the question-
ing of Playboy 5 values would raise much
broader issues, however. Kit Leder, a
participant, explained the need she felt
“to defend the idea or what is supposed
to be behind a liberal arts education. We
were trying to follow the values our edu-
cation has led us to. We didn't feel antag—
onistic toward the institution, but were
dealing with issues as individuals which
are broader than the institution."

Another participant, Molly Malcolm,
expressed concern for the feeling on
campus that “any news going out is
going to be a label for Griimell.” Miss
Malcolm was interviewed and answered
phone questions on Whoradio in Des
Moines shortly roiiowing the demon-
slratlon, and was pleased with the num-

her the reason for the Call so She went
directly to the station. A plalnclothea
man, who was in the office with the
Chief, informed her of her rights. She
had had no counsel at this time, and de-
cided at first to remain silent. Chief
Peters would not tell her “what he
wanted" until she signed a waiver of
her rights. She elected to cooperate, and
signed the waiver. Chief Peters wrote
out a confession about disrobing, asking
her to Write in certain names in her own
handwriting, which she did. After finish-
ing the contession, Chief Peters informed
Miss Nelson that he had received no
complaints, but that he would take the
confession to some attorneys to see it
there was any possibility of prosecution.
Although he refused an interview with
the 53d} on this subject, he did say that
he was merely interested if} "C ,,
the law."

The Office of the Dean of Students
contacted all students known by them
to be participants in the disrobing in
Gates Lounge by means or a letter,
copies of which were also sent to the stu-
dents’ parents. The alleged participant]
were not informed of this action until
the letters had been sent. The letter
stated, in part, that “. . . the incident
has done harm to the college's educa-
tional effort by damaging its public ro<
putation. , .your action will ﬁnally have
less impact on the problems you describe
than it will in confirming many in their
belief that appearances do count, that

HEFFNER AMUSED

In response to the Grinnell demonstra-
tion of February 5, Anson Mount, Public
Affairs Manager for Playboy Magazine,
has stated “that although Heffner only
reacted with mild amusement, I person<
ally found the incident hilarious. it re«
minded me of my own college days when
we used to pull parity raids." Mount then
went on to state that he was surprised
students would demonstrate against Play-
boy since Playboy is the only national
magazine that has constantly supported
the student's right to dissent. He then
asked what the demonstration was actual-
ly about. When familiarized with the stuv
dents objections to dehumanization of the
female, and exploitation of the sexual
act, Mount agreed with the dissenters and
said that the demonstration was naive
and Childish, since Playboy also has the
same objections.

“We attempt to present the personality
as well as the body of a girl. We never
print just a picture without an article.
We believe that the human body is a
beautiful rather than an obscene thing,
but that does not mean that we lorget the
person behind the body. or course we
present a man's viewpoint because we
are a man's magazine. it’s just like the
Ladies Home Journal is for women.” He
ﬁnished his remarks by saying that it
might be fun to place a copy of last
week's Pterodactyi in the State Attorney
General’s mailborn

EDITORIAL

Politics or People?

The protest of Playboy, was not only a protest against
the commercialism that ignores those aspects of women that
stand for humanness, but an assertion by several individuals
of their belief in communication, sensitivity and human dig-
nity.

A protest is an attempt at symbolic communication, one
of the unique aspects of the human animal, Unfortunately,
the society, the press, and even some of the most sensitive
people will not think of the individual communication and
sensitivity expressed by these people. Because of this, peo-
ple are hurt, improper correlations are made, things like the

nstitution’s losing money or fearing for its reputation occur.
Someone in Des Moines gets scared and starts an investiga—
tion. An investigation of what?

Will an impersonal, “no comment,” secretly prying
group of men increase (or even desire to increase) under«
standing, communication, or sensitivity? The motivation, EX<
pressions, and nature of their work, makes any honest in-
vestigation impossible.

The Attorney General’s office has brought fear to the
campus through their approach and their goals. This seems
to be a perfect example of what the demonstration was pro-
testing against —- impersonality and dehumanization. The
investigators have missed the point of the protest by being
here at all.

The state attorney has sent four men including the as-
sistant state attorney to prosecute trivial crimes. The dam-
age to individuals inyolved is not a consideratioato this
3131:; WE? (in radicals. When will human values replace poli‘
tics?

Communication, sensi vity, human dignity; they are all
positive aspects of the human situation. The happenings of
the past week diminish one’s hope that these are in reality,
the values of the society, the community or some individuals.

To The Parents of M . Low and M . Thompson

Dear Parents:

Your children have been identified as
those among a group of Grinnell admin-
istrators who have apparently misused
the responsibilities of their respective
positions, First, they have circumvented
the regular college procedure for viola»
tiou OI social regulations as prescribed
i.“ the “Student Handbook” and the
"Grinnell College Bulletin." In their lei-
Ier to the Playboy pmtestors and their
parents they have acted as boih prose-
cumr, judge, and jury. Their letter he—
gins “You have been identified as one
of a group or students who dlsrobed in
Gales Lounge" yet who identiﬁed them
and with what authority? Not only have
these students been unofficially accused,
but. they have also been unofficially
round guiliy. one wonders why your
Son/daughter did not use the established
judicial process and chose to go outside
all legal procedure.

lt is also my unfortunate task to in-
toun you that your son/daughter acted
in a way which did not do honor to
their proiession, Since when do the deans
write students’ parents without inform—
Eg the involved students first? Such a
procedure appears at once irregular
and unethical, beneiidng neither those
[orients involved nor their parents. In
fact, it would appear that your letter
has benefited no one. What purpose did
your son/daughter have in mind? One
wonders when such practices will be
put to an end.

I quote the shove mentioned letter in
mien-ice not to the protesters but rather
to your children:
“...Wedoml.ke|hepdntthltyour
action in let! the hum-n issues less
I|seflllly detlned, Ind in some gunners
has generated I nuﬂon antagonistic. lo
the college nod to lo education-l nah.
“column/cl, vac loam-lib
problems [oriented by a conﬂict It this

sort (that is, problems created by doing
impulsive damage to the institution that
you presumably are beneﬁting from)
are becoming steadily more complex.”
I invite you to discuss the implications
of this incident at your convenience.
Sincerely yours.

Concern for reputation

To the editor:

It has become Increasingly apparent
that a minority or students on the cam-
pus of Grinnell College are creating an
image that 15 not representative of the
entire student body. The image of Grin-
nell as a radical institution has not
merely appeared subsequent to the dem-
onstration against Playboy Magazine. it
has, rather, been evolving over a period
at time that has been punctuated by a
variety of controversial incidenis. In the
light of the philosophy of a liberal arts
college, we have too long silently toler—
ated these occurrences, and we now
feel compelled to express our opinions.

1. it has become increasingly more
difficult to study in an atmosphere in
which everything from our human dig—
nity to our intelligence is being insulted.
The events which have taken place have
ranged, in our opinion, from the inane
to the offensive and i“clude the Guer-
rilla Theater's presentation on Satur-
day, October is at the Symposium for
Parent’s Weekend and at second semes—
ter registration, the mosi recent issue of
the Plel‘odactyl, and mo Playboy den-l-
onslration. The last of these is the cul-
minalion of the tone that has been prop-
ogaled by the minority.

2. These events have had ramifica-
tions outside the student community
Siiiémehts released to the Des Molnes
Register have been expressed as rep<
resentative of the majority of the stun
dent body; we doubt that this is so.
Them has been a resultant loss of pres-
tige as regards the college. This is evi-
denced in rhe canceled enrollment of
several prospective students and the
dissatisfaction voiced among present
students, parents, and alumni.

3. With reference to the Playboy dem-
onstratlon in particular, we ﬁnd it ironic
that those who were protesting the com-
mercializailon of the human body used
the identical methods to iuriher the ac—
tions of people loosely affiliated with the
campus.

4. Misrepresentation of student opin-
ion extends inio other sectors of college
life. We understand that the Student
Senate is to be sensitive to the views of
the entire student body. From its actions
this year and last, we feel that [his is
highly questionable. For example, a 33m
appropriation was made to the Piemd-
lay! on October 2, 1968. This money was
appropriated under the guise of a single
ad. If this publication is not college‘
sponsored, we ask why college funds
were utilized. $300 seems an exorbant
amount to cover only one no.

We realize that the mere statement
of opinions is not sufficient. The solu-
tions to these problems that will induce
change he perhaps in greater partici-
pation of the majority in szudem elec-
tions, the Student Senate, and concerned
reaction to activities at the campus.

Don’t waste your money

To the Editor:

As we all know, attorney general
people are on campus to investigate, as
they say, “some matters.” Apparently
their main concern is the strip, the nasty
and heinous protest that occurred a
week ago and which, for the first time
in our minds, brought extensive atten-
[ion to the fact that “Playboy," exploits
women's beauty, to be sure, “Play-
boy’s" grotesque concept or beauty.

Assuming these men earn at least
$7,000 a year. which figures in wages
to around $4 an hour, together they are
paid $128.00 a day. We assume that they
do not work in the evening since on
Tuesday night one of the men accom«
panied by a man not known for certain
to be an agent, both apparently drunk,
asked us where the john was. Unless
they were employing some kind of tactic
to extract information by feigning
drunkenness we assume they work an
eight hour day. Surely they would not
carry on their mission in a drunken
stupor.

These men have been here since Tues-
day and will leave Thursday or Friday
we think. So, around $500 will be spent
on their salaries alone. Add on to this
figure another $500 for further adminiS‘
trative work and miscellaneous ex’m
passes. it something like hearings 0')? "
trials result, the expense would perhaps
add up to $5,000.

We suggest that the attorney general
get the hell out of Grinnell College and
the state spend this money in a ghetto
or, it the state insists on spending the
money on law and order, we suggest
that it be spent against the maﬁa In-
stead 0! against some people who took
all their clothes,

To the Editor:

Neil Fischer’s and Greg Schmidt's pro-
gram on the college radio station KDIC
on February 11 during which they
claimed that 1 organized the recent nuda
demonstration against Playboy maga-
zine in order in make money by selling
photographs to the press, is a complete
distortion of the facts. It is an insult
ro those who actually did organize the
protest. The organizers of course can’t
reveal themselves at this time due to
the investigation by the state Attorney
Generals office. This information will of
course come out in time and Neil and
Greg will prove themselves to be liars.
Many oiher statements made during the
radio program were also completely un-
true. Neither Neil nor Greg not anyone
else contacted me about their information
helore or after the program.

Since that time Mm Ruth. Prescott.
representing the college puhue relations
ellice, has sent copies of the program
in the Associated Press, United Press
International, Grinnell radio station

ber of supporting calls she received.
Several callers giving support explained
that they had not been able to support
(or understand) earlier demonstrations.
In summarizing her hope for the effect
of the demonstration, Miss Malcolm
said, “We’re aware of the possible nega-
live results, but feel that, overall, the
good will outweigh the bad.”

Perhaps the good has already begun to
overbalance the bad. At a group discus-
sion Wednesday, organized by the par-
ticipants, dissident Views were aired and
communication was reached.

Most or those witnessing the demon-
tratlon Wednesday characterized their
own reactions as "edgy” or “embar-
rassed at first" but, having overcome
the initial shock, felt no oliense by the
others’ nudity. One student remarked
that it was the most meaningful demon-
stration as directed against Brice Drap~
er, representative of Playboy, was iairly
ineffective. Draper, although somewhat
shaken, joked through the situation and
then continued to answer questions after
the students had sung "You've got to
Walk That lonesome Valley”. Many
seemed to feel, also, that the participants
must have had to anticipate the sensa-
tionalism the demonstration would cause,
and, ior that reason, questioned the par-
ticipants use of sensationalism to give
backing to their protest.

Outside negative reaction to the dem-
onstration was first received by the
Admissions Office. Mr. Paul Tonic, an
admissions counselor in the office, said
that they had had a call Thursday morn-
ing, the morning after the demonstrae
tion, irorn the father of a student already
admitted to next year’s freshman class
on the early admissions plan. He can-
celled his daughter’s place in the class,
giving the demonstration as the reason.
Torno, who is one of the college’s repre-
sentatives for prospective students in
Iowa, stated that demonstrations in the
past seem to have been responsible for
a drop in number of iowa applications,
although “the quality or the applications
has remained high.”

Mr. James Avison, Director of Devel-
opment. already has a tile iii irate letters
written in response to the demonstra-
tion. One, from an alumnus who is can»
ceiling a three-year pledge, includes the
Comment that students do not need his
money because they are so omniscient
that they do not need to go to college at
all. Another points out the difference be-
tween the liberal tradition at Grinnell
and the present anarchy, ”which no
amount of money can help". Avison
comments, “The stripetease doesn’t
bother me; what does bother me is that
the incidents are designed to hit the
papers; and they do, from coast to
coast.” He adds that all he can say to

Reaciion and response seem to have
been the passwords surrounding the

response has been unsettling to watch,
however. It’s a bit scary to see how
many times the opinion of the protest
given torth has been controlled by
someone or something outside of the
person talking, such as the practicality
of an admissions quota, the state of
mind of a principle donor, or a friend’s
opinion of Olle’s own opinion. Hope-
fully, the demonstration of pride and
respect or the human body given in

with more than a light conversation
topic. If it has aided the process of
chipping away at our comfortable,
exclusive padding of liberalism, ra-
dicalism, lascism, (insert your
individual catagory if you’ve stopped
questioning), that’s good. if it has
brought us it glimpse of Ihe human

you remember a few important feel-

that’s good. If It has brought us I
glimpse of some other way of living

round us and nimble around inside of

seen and forgotten), that’s good.

To the extent that we've had these

AIM First Phase goal of $10 million by
June 30, 1972. This does not include the
government grant of $540,000 and govern-
ment loan or $943,000 toward the $2.2
million P. E. Complex. The long-range
goal is $25 million.

AIM is divided into "People and
Programs with an objective of 55,-
709,000; and "Programs for Build-
ings”, with an objective of $4,291,000.
This means that slightly more than
hall of the projected money is to fill
needs tor closing the gap between
tuition and costs, new teaching pro-
jects and research for both faculty
and students, sophisticated equip
ment, student aid to keep Grinnell
trom becoming only for the attluent,
higher salaries for faculty, new curri-
culum offerings, and library expan-
sion.

An example of a current AIM-funded
program is the Milwaukee Theater se~
master. The AIM program got an experi-
mental grant from the Rockefeller
Foundation for it. James 0. Avison, di-
rector oi development, says one can bet
that anything new that takes money is a
part ot me AIM program.

The "Program for Buildings" is cur-
rently relocating the track and field
across Tenth Avenue where the bull-
dozers recently cut up the grass and took
out the apple trees. The P. E. complex
will be built just east ot and overlapping
the present Ward Field.

The South Campus Reception Center is
an already-completed AIM project. The
new residence hall, to be built where the
swimming pool now stands, renovations,
and retirement of the debt the college
assumed to build the new B and G bulld-
ings are other First Phase AlM objec-
tives. Projects for the second phase are
a central dining hall east of Darby, and
a Fine Arts Museum, next to Barber
Plaza. However, the trustees have not
yet approved a new dorm, dining hall
or museum.

The college’s trustees themselves
are heavy contributors to AIM. De~
velapment personnel show college
plans to all kinds or Foundations;
this is the fund-raising procedure of
AIM. Avison lists reasons why indivi-
duals give to AIM: others are doing
it; they love the institution; gifts to
Grinnell are tax—deductible; often for
a reeling of immortality through it

seeking immortality are thuse most

Dean Stauss has been a faculty mem»
bar at Grinneli. since 1946, and has been
dean of the college since 1960. He served
as acting president (or more than a year
in 1964 and 1965, after the resignation of
Dr. Howard R. Bowen to become presi—
dent of the University of lowa and prior
to the election of Dr. Glenn Leggett as
his successor. Mr. Siauss plans to teach
and do writing and research on higher
education alter this year.

President Leggett called Mr. Stauss'
recommendations “very well thought out
and precise" and said that he was “very
favorable” to the report. Dean Stauss

Ad. Building Seized In Student Power Play

By BILL RAFFERTY

“I’ve learned how to be cynical about
waiting, committees and about the
‘sacred nature of the institution!’ HOW
much longer do you want us to wait?
It’s about time we were a little realistic.
We’ve waited long enough.”

This statement by Alina Grossman,
an undergraduate at the University ot
Chicago, characterized the majority View
of students who voted to take over the
Admlnistration Building, January 30,
1969. The Students intend to remain in
the building until their demands are
met.

This demonstration called non-vio-
lent disruption hy the students, is the
latest phase in the attempt to gain

student power in making iaculty and
administrative decisions. Although the
movement has been building for some
time, the tiring of sociologist Marlene
Dixon is the main issue in contention.
The students occupying the AdminisA
[ration Building have [our non-negotiable
demands,

L Rehire Miss Dixon.

2. Amnesty tor protestnrs (61 suspen-
sions have been issued).

3. Equal student participation in hir-
ing and ﬁring.

l, Full payment tor school employees
in the Administration Building.

.The demonstrators expected the Ed-
ministrators to comply with the de

mands, forcibly evict the students, or
close the University. However, alter two
weeks, suspensions are ihe‘only visible
reaction. Apparently the administrators
hope the sit-in will die with time.

The number or protestors has
dwindled. The original 400 has dropped
to an estimated 175 actively involved.
Although this seems to justify admin-
istrative hopes, the obstacles the
group has overcome makes a “natural
death” unlikely.

The movement was organized by the
‘Committee of 85'. 0f the ‘85' one-third
were SDS organizers, the remainderim
eluded numerous organizations ranging
from the extremely radical to the
staunchly conservative. Of these, WRAP
(Women’s Radical Action Project), and
the Guerrilla Theater are Oi Special im-
portance.

Those not willing to participate but
still Wish to act have formed a Guerrilla
Theater group. The group has been
instrumental in presenting the issues
to those not actively involved.
The Women's Liberation movement
is responsible tor the negotiable de-
mand for 50% women on the faculty.

A Do “Yourself Guide To A Successful Sil-In

By SUSAN KAESER

The Administration budding at the
University or Chicago is presently hous-
ing so to 100 students a day. Liie in the
administration building is quite diiterent
from the usual activities that are Con-
ducted there. The student protesters
who took over the building January 30.
have been sleeping in the President’s
oliice and other carpeted rooms. The
fifth floor contains the security center,
the kitchen (a desk with peanut butter,
cold cuts, bread, and cheese), and a
study area (several oilice typewriters
and calculators are being used). School
still goes on so students leave the build-
ing to attend classes, shower, or get a
good night's sleep,

One protester explained that it is not
too dilticult to participate in this sort of
living situation. There are 10 steps that
are usually taken in establishing res-
dence in an administration building

1. Go through all proper channels to
make your demands known.

2. Pamphlet the campus and make
people aware of plans, goals. times and
places.

3. Hold a rally to decide actions and
when to take them.

4. Set up a steering committee to or-

range ior iood, security, telephoning.
and legal aid it necessary.

5. Have someone planted in the bulld-
ing who can case the joint, lmd guards,
make sure things will work. and give
the sign to enter.

6. Meet at appointed time and place,
mill around outside, and wait for a Sign
to enter.

7. Enter building and allow those in
the building to leave.

8. Don’t let administrators back in.

9. Set up security and move in.

10. Stay until your demands are met.

Several diilerent types oi people are
living in the building. One participant
characterized three major groups.
“There are lhxee groups of people, the
two iactions oi SDS who write pamphlets
all da the moderates who don’t. do
anythi g, and the freaks who take care
of security.”

There is no central power group run-
ning the protest. There are several com-
mittees which are responsible tor load,
security, and negotiations. but all deci-
sions about action come from mas:
meetings. According to one student,

Unrealized Potential for Student involvement

By KATHY BULL

The Havemnn report of Scptelllber,
1967 proposed the establishment of Ed-
|icatlorlal Policy Committees for the
three div ons, Humanities, Social Sci-
ences, and Science. Tlle E,P.C.s are still
in the discussing and planning stage of
all proposals and no concrete action has
been taiten to initiate signiﬁcant changes.

One of the unfortunate aspects of
the E.P.C.s is that they have no real
decision-making power; their function
is purely recommendations]. This
weakens the positive action of form
log a student-faculty committee.

A major issue in each division has
been the desirability of student repre-
sentatives, the role of the students on
the committee, and the methods with
which the students on the committee.
and the methods with which the stu-
dents would be selected. The divisional
E.P.C.s have dealt with this problem in
Various ways, and have emphasized dif-
ferent areas requiring renovation. Vot-
ing power for both the faculty and stu-
dent participants is still undecided.

The need for a Well-defined divisional
organization and assuming of “import-
ant educational functions,” the promo-
tion of communication and cooperation
among departments, particularly con<
cerning interdisciplinary and interde<
partmental study and the facilitation of
communication with other divtsions and
the Executive Council, are specified by
the Haveman Report as reasons for es-
tablisning E.P.C.S.

The committees do not sewe as de-
tisionemaking bodies; rather, they make
recommendations to be voted on by the
laculty, division or Executive Council. A
large share of the Work is done within
the departments and is cleared by the
committee,

Each di sional committee decided
how often they will meet and how
many student representatives they
will have. The latter decision is sub—
ject to the entire faculty’s approval.
Although most at the committee mem-
bers agree that student participation

Penalty credits considered

After the Thanksgiving recess. a num-
ber of faculty members questioned the
half credit penalty which is added to the
graduation requirement or absent siu<
limits This penalty was instituted several
years ago to curb students who cut, not
only the days immediately before and
after Vacations, but in some cases. seV<
eral days preceding and following.

A committee composed of a faculty
member from each division and two stu-
dent consultants was established to look
into the questions A report should be
compiled in the next few weeks and pre~
sellted to the Executive Council of the
Faculty, who will in turn make recom-
mendations to the faculty as a whole.

It is difficult to predict what the final
‘decision will be. The student body and
many faculty members are opposed to the
penalty because it is ineifective in that
it covers only six days of the school year.
However, there is also support of the
penalty for lack of an alternative.

on the committees is important, the
Humanities and Social Science di-

visions have not yet elected student
representatives. This, however, is not
entirely the fault of the faculty The

student attendance 'at the EEC. 01‘-
ganizational meetings was very poor.

The Humanities committee held ﬁve
organizational meetings last semester
ahd have not met this semester. Pres-
ently sludenu are not represented at
these meetings. While there has been
some sentiment against student repre-
sentation, the majority recognize a need
for student participation, disagreeing
only on form. A faculty member describ-
ed the function of the E.P.C. as a
“cleaning house for course proposals and
the other proposals related to curricu-
lum revisions,”

The Science division has met once this
semester and plans to meet every two
weeks. A student elected by the majors
represents his department at the meet-
ings. Mr. Danforth, head of the com-
mittee, feels cooperation between the
students and faculty will be worthwhile.
in the future he hopes to sea the cum<
mittee examining the acceptance and
eifectiveness of Science I and it re-
quirelnents and assembling information
to make recommendations to the entire
division.

The Social Science division has not
yet determined their policy on student
representation and is delaying issues
until student participation is estab-
lished. The Political Science depart-
ment majors have initiated their own
Student Educational Policy Committee,
electing two juniors and three seniors.
This committee will participate in var-
ious decision-making aspects of the de-
partment, but will not be directly as<
sociated with the divisional E.P.C.

Students Challenged

From
RICHARD SCHMIEKEN, JANET SMITH
KATHY BULL, ROGER KOENKER

The Humanities and Social Science
Divisions have still not elected student
representatives to their Educational Po<
licy Committees. We feel that the stu~
dents should not wait for the faculty to
request their organizing but should go
ahead and take action. If they expect to
have a voice in the important issues that
will be considered by the committees this
semester (perhaps recommendations for
a new Dean could be suggested) they
must take the time and etiort to organ-
ize Within the department and elect re
preseiltatives. Regular meeting times
shoulti be agreed upon immediately.

We hope that the E.l’. .s will not be
only “clearing houses" for departmental
proposals, but will also be able to illi<
tiate experimental interdisciplinary and
independent studies programs and re-
search the value of comprehensive
exams, and general educational require-
ments. \Ve also hope that the delay in
establishing the committees Will not
have condemned them to second semes-
ter lethargy'. or worse, that the faculty
will Stall action until it becomes too late
for the students to share in any decisions
about next year’s curriculum

Controversial Concert Defended

By MOLLY MCGUIRE

A new breed of music was introduced
to Grinneii last weekend in the term or
the Cecil Taylor Unit, an avantegarde
jazz quartet. If nothing else. the concert
became a topic of controversy on cam
pus as the music was ioreign and incom-
prehensible t0 the cars at most of the
audience. Arguments raged over the
quality or value at the music itself as
well as the advisability of bringing this
type of music to Grinnell.

Comments ranged from the facetious
Bandstand favorite, “Oh, it didn’t have
a very good beat and I couldn't dance
to it," to the popular. “It stunkl” Those
who liked it seemed overpowered by it—-
they were completely carried away emo-
tionally: “l was intoxicated by it," was
one of the more extreme comments on
the positive side.

Generally. however, there seemed to
be unfavorable response from the cam-
pus, On this note, the 5&3 talked to Gary
Giddcns and Lee Shambel‘g oi the Social
Coordinating Committee to let them ex-
plain their reasons for bringing in Cecil
Taylor, and also to let them comment
on the student reaction.

Their reason for presenting a concert
of tllis type was two-fold, First, ciddens
felt that “any controversy started in this
conservative melange of apathy and
lethargy would be beneficial.” Shamberg
added, ”The concert was a result ol a

each persons thinks of what should be
done and then does it. “Things are a bit
sloppy, but they get done." The protes-
tors are particularly concerned in not
defining a power structure.

Life during the ﬁrst week was excit-
ing but with time some interest is dying.
Protesters, no matter what interest
group they were from. were unified by
their actions and engaged in intensive
communication. One student said it was
a “great educational experience," DisA
cussions between very different types
of people ranged all the way from
politics through concepts of human na-
ture.

After almost two weeks, the tudents

budge until some action is taken on their
demands. Some people are losing inter»
est. but many students insist on staying.

continuous attempt to make the concerts
program an organic part of the educa-
tional process. Education involves a
challenge to one's standards and pre-
conceptions."

Secondly, they wanted to expose stu-
dents to music they may never listen to
on their own, or even realize existed.
"The importance of the concert,"
stressed Giddens, ”was that the students
got a chance to hear this music, not
Whether they liked it or disliked its one
of my hopes in bringing in Taylor was
that people would be moved to investi-
gate the music more fully on their own,"

Those criticizing the quality of the mu-
sic itself were severly chided by Giddens
and Shamberg. They argued that to criti-
cize quality [mm a position of total ignor-
ance is “indefensible,"

Instead of judging the music by the
standards of familiar Western music,
they stressed that one must realize that
Taylor is working in a diiierelit medium,
that of an AirorAlnerican culture. Gid-
dens stressed, “Whatever similarities
there are between Tay rand Mozart are
outweighed by similarities between Tay-
for and Ellington,"

Giddcns was particularly disturbed by
the fact that so much of the audience
left before and during intermission. He
said that if they would have stayed longer
they very possibly would have ended up
enjoying it (which is what did happen
in several cases.) He said that Taylor
Wasn't playing for those who left, but
for those who stayed long enough to
enjoy listening to the music as much as
he did playing it.

SENATE CENSURES
ADMiNlSTRATION

Wednesday evening the senators gath
ored corporealiy boiore an audience in
the South Lounge, 3 “substantiva
change" from the past. The major sub-
ject, and the final one of the evening was
the matter at a response to the actions of
the Deans’ Office regarding last week's
demonstration, After considerable de-
bate as to the role of the senate in ques-
tioning “guidelines”, the following mO‘
iron was passed:

“On February 5, l969, a number of
Grinnell College students participated in
a demonstration against Playbay Maga-
zine. Subsequent to that incident, the 0i—
1ice of the Deans of Students sent letters
to the Students participating in the dem-
onstratlon. Copies of this letter hava
been sent to the parents or these stu-
dents. The demonstrators themselves
were not informed of this notification un-
til after it had been effected.

We seriously question the conduct of
the Deans' Otiice in handling the matter.
We believe the action to be discriminah
tory, arbitrary, and contrary to accepted
administrative practice.

The Grlnnlell College Senate there«
fore respectfully requests that the Stu<
dent Faculty Judicial Council consider

the following:

i) The action at the Dean‘l Oﬂica
. ribed above.

2) The existing college guidelines for
administration-parent contact can-
coming individ a1 students.

3) The possibilities of clariﬁcation
and/oi- extension at these guide-
lines.”

A second motion, also related to the
demonstration was passed unanimously.
Acting under the belief that the Attorney
General's investigation extends beyond
the implications of the February 5th de-
monstration, the senate stated, “. . .As
both the implications and results of such
An investigation are possibly detrimental
to the college, its ideals, and goals, we
not only remind members of the col-
lege community, but encourage them to
exercise their respective privileges to
withhold information from the represen~
tatives of the Attorney General, unless
Iubpoenaed."

years at the University at Chicago. Surl-
veys indicate that female students are
more solidly behlnd the protest than men.

Why are they still mere? one student,
alter 12 days in rho building, replied
"I voted against the sit-in because

don’t believe in disruptive protest, i am

. not a sociology major and wlll never

have Marlene for a class. Yet, nonrpar<
ticlpation is an act against the shin. I
thought, ‘Suppose it was one of my
teachers, that I really dig and found I
couldn’t learn from her any more} l'd
have to know Whyl We tried to ﬁnd
out why in Dixon’s case but everyone,
the faculty, the Deans, the president,
all reiused to answer. To be faithful to
my beliefs in education, I had to sit-in.”

The unifying fame of educational ud-
vancement has held the group to<
gether. They tool at this pain: that it
they iert "nothing would be done, it
we stay at least there is hope." It
is unlikely that the protest will end
without definite administrative action.

The student body questions the valid-
ity of thls farm of protest. They fear it
will endanger the University's position.
However. the majority of students and
many faculty sympathize with the ideals.
Ono non-parti pant commented, “it
sure is dumb Lu: it’s at least {1“ 3 av:

the University or Chicago is thinking.
and the outcome should be significant

to universities and colleges across the

college academic problems centering on
the responsibilities of both faculty and
students and on student power. stimulat-
ed by the termination of Prof. Parzen’l
contract, the meeting was attended by a
number or faculty members. seven bio:
logy majors, members or the radical
education project, a number of student
advisors, and other concerned student].

strong sentiment was expressed in
iavor 01 greater ltudent representation
in college policy decisions, particularly
in the hiring and tiring of faculty. The
resignation of Dean Stauss also stimulat.
ed interest in the possibility of making
large-scale changes in the collage aca-
demio structure and attitudes. It had
been reported that Stauss proposed in his
resignation speech a number of radical
changes [or Grinnell. Stauss’s racoms
mendations will be made public later.
