 

Participants in March:
Variety in A ye, Region

By Jean Vandervoort

Ed. note: Jean Vandervoort
was one of several Grinnell
students who participated in
last Saturday's march on
Washington to protest U. s.
involvement in the Viet Nam
war.

Eight Grinnell students were
among those who went on the
march to end the war in Viet

Nam in Washington, D. C., last
Saturday

There is great diversity of
opinion as to how many people
participated in the march. News
commentators on the scene es-
timated the number at 35,000,
the Washington Post at 20,000,
while AP reports said 12,000 to
15,000, Whatever is correct,

Off-Campus Living for Meni
Conference House to Be Open

“Otircampus housing will be
available next year to is men stu-
dents in 1205 Park Street (Confer-
ence House) and to a number of
men who may obtain approved
rental housing in town.” This
statement was made by Dean of
Men 5. Eugene Thompson Wed~
nesday.

North campus room drawings
have been postponed until May 3
to provide an opportunity for
gathering more "exact information
on total enrollment. Final enroll-
ment iigures will determine how
many students will be able to
rent rooms in town,

All men will draw for rooms on
north campus, but those interested
in offrcampus housing should fill
out an application (available at
the ofﬁce of the dean of men)
Applications should be returned to
the dean of men by noon on Tues-
day, April 27.

Thompson noted that the total

 

number of men living outside the

permanent residence halls will not
actually be increased. However,
since there will be fewer married
students and students whose homeo
are in town, the number of men air
lowed to obtain rooms in town may
increase. ,

Language Houses Out;
Pine Tree Now Open

Jean M. Slocum, dean of women,
announced tllls week that there
will be no Spanish or French
floors or houses in the women’s
residence hall system next year.
Whether to have a German-speak-
ing ﬂoor is still under considera-
tion.

Pine Tree house, which this
year was French house, will be
used as a residence by upperclass
women students, and will be a sly
ter house to Cleveland halli

Folk Group Will Dance Sunday

afternoons in the Women's Gymi

By Krys Neuman

The Grinnell folk dancing so-
ciety will present its spring pro-
gram Sunday at 8 pm. in Roberts
Theatre.

The group has learned dances
of seventeen nations. Representa-
tive costumes have been designed
and sewn by some or the girls in

 

the group, although an original
German costume is being worn in
the dance Schuhplatter and the
girls in Pas d'Espagne will dance
in authentic Finnish wear.

The talk dancers were organized
in the fall of 1963 and have now
expanded to about forty members
who have been practicing Sunday

 

One special attraction of the
group is the fact that dancing can
be used for gym credit.

Mrs, William Roecker, who be-
fore coming to Grinnell was ac-
tive in an Oregon folk dancing
group, has been instrumental in
teaching and organizing the Grin-
nell dancersi This year she has
worked with president Jean Wat-
son, secretary Eva Gardebring and
treasurer Jan Thomas. She said
that beginners should always feel
welcome as new dances are ale
ways being taught.

Although last year the group
danced casually for a limited audi—
ence on the ralnrsoaked Spring
Day, this year the program prom-
ises to be much more spectacular.
The group promises a Special sur-
prise toward the end of the pro-
gram And even though the group
does not claim to be another Royal
Ballet, it does guarantee a per-
formance both colorful and gay.

Mortar Board Picks
Eight Junior Coeds

Mortar Board, national women’s
honorary society, named eight jun-
ior women to its ranks this week.

Tapped for the society at Mon-
day night dinner were Karen Ad-
kinson, Sylvia Johnson, Cherie
Joiner, Marlon Mayes, Chris Pet~
ei'son, Barb Plager, Judy Roberts,
and Carrie Smiley,

Social Chairmen
Sophomores John Emery and
Cris Swanson have recently been
named north and south campus
social chairmen.

Faculty Says No JLA Next Year.
But Final Decision Still Uncertain

The Junior Liberal Arts ex-
amination will not be admin
istered to next year’s juniors,
although the idea of the exam
has not been abandoned en—

tirely, Acting President James
Stauss announced Wednesday.

The faculty voted to discon-
tinue the exam at a faculty
meeting Monday.

The faculty statement noted
that ”the final disposition of the
examination will be considered
at some time in the future in
conjunction with a broad, com<
prehensive evaluation of the en-
tire curriculum."

Present juniors who deferred
taking the JLA until September
1965 must fulfill the require-
ment.

 

Christiansen Debunks Race Concept 1
As lndefinable, Scientifically Useless

“If there’s such a thing as racial
superiority, we’d better be quiet
about it and hope nobody ﬁnds
out.” With that statement Kenneth
Christiansen (biology) closed his
informal remarks at Tuesday
night's dinnerrdiscussion about bio-
logical iallacies behind discrimina-
tion.

The talk was followed by discus
sion with Ronald Kurtz (anthro-
pologY) and was part of a series
on "Understanding the Race Prob-
lem," sponsored by the Board of
Religion,

Christiansen’s final remark lol-
Iowed a listing of possible char-
acteristics upon which a theory of
racial superiority might be based.
On each characteristic presented
(resistance to disease, tolerance to
temperature extremes, etc), in-
vestigation has suggested that ei—
ther the Mongoloid or Negroid ra-
cial groups are better “iit” than
Caucasoid.

 

Christiansen explained briefly

 

the nature of the populations which
are generally considered “racial
groups," though he also explained
that he considers the concept of
"race" as too indefinable to be sci-
entifically useful, He and Kurt:
agreed that the threerace con-
cept is particularly unhelpful.

Racial or ”subspecies” groups
are smaller divisions of a species
(a grouping whose members no-
turally interbreed with one anoth-
at)

Racial characteristics are large-
ly the result of adaptation to dit-
fering environments and are so di-
verse that it is impossible to cats-
gorize members into distinct

Christiansen Says in Lecture

“ Iy Wayne sungel

critically examining the “art
'deals with search, science deals
with research" attitude that he
believes has widened the gap
between art and science, Ken-
neth Christiansen (biology) il-
lustrated both the ever-increas-
ing similarities and the neces-
Iary contrasts between the two
fields at a fine arts lecture last
Thursday

He noted the act of creation
15 the strongest bond between
scientist and humanist. “The
mientist and the artist only live
when they are creating,” he
said. In this light Christiansen
questioned whether one can di-
yol'ce the search for scientific
knowledge from the search at
beauty. “What scientists strive
to achieve is honesty, and who
cries more about honesty than
the artist?” he asked.

Christiansen leels that the
artist alld scientist have been
most seriously estranged by the
common conception of scien-

 

tific processes “Data-gathering
or processing is no more I
process of science than canvas—
stretching is that of art. The
really important questions of
science are what kinds of ques-
tions will be asked and not
what the answers Will be," he
said

In outlining necessary differ-

ences between science and art,
Christiansen cited the contrast-

ing importance oi emotion as a
in the work of the
scientist and the artist, and the
practically limitless scope of
artistic endeavor as compared

stimulus

with the more restricted hori—
zons of science.

In defining the most basic

difference Christiansen said,

"Science has one basic differ-

ence from art—testability.

Artistic criticism cannot be put

on a scientific basis. A truly
scientiiic criticism is virtually
impossible. Plow

merit of science—testability?”

David Lighthourne
letters to Mother

All too Utter], It seems like Grinnell's social pro
gram is nothing but an attempt to make nur week-
ends around here minimally bearable, a schizoid
effort to forget that we're a small, voluntarily iso-
lated community with a, high percentage oi bore-
dom. This policy has Iouhd its highest expression
in the one and only Cate del Faro, where Chicago
expenseaccount plushness is rivalled only by the
opulence of the chic young hedonists who can be
seen revelling in its gay, glittering, sophisticated
atmosphere every Friday and Saturday night

Grinhell's concert series is, of course, an at-
tempt at a middleclass complement to the jet-set
intimacy of the coffeehouse. Accordingly, all the
seedy delights of In Ed Sullivan mentality periodi-
cally come our way — not in the confines of 21
inches, but magnified, instead, to the vast scale of
Darby’s masscult facilities.

Thus we have had the pop in: hink of Nina
Simone, tooling with a strap on her lcwcut dress
in me sordid dustiness of Darby's old, battered
basketball court, surrounded by personality cult
followers, Victims of Several varieties, as well as
all the rest, who were perhaps just looking for
something to look it. Although the spectacle or
Miss Simone was more compelling than usual, ber
cause of the essential ersatz at the whole pathetic

presentation, other examples have been even worse,
usually because of ii plain lack of talent.

In marked contrast to the usual pattern. how-
ever, last weekend saw the performance of Jan
Redpnth, a Scottish folksinger and amateur (olkr
lorist, whose loiowledgeable regard for the beauty
or Scottish iclk literature gave us a progrnin lull
or simple grace mid charmr Miss Redpath is prob-
ably ihe finest protessitmal {olksinger in the coun-
try, not only because at the {lawlessness of her
singing, but because at her attention to appropriate
style in the loving recreation of authentic lolk art.
She is that rare kind of folk singer who is sufficient-
ly removed trim the personality cult of the folk
music revival in be an artist rather than a teenage
legend object writ in large neon letters midst a
sea of militant phoniness. >

The point Is that it is the responsibility at the
concerLs committee to give the college community
a level or quality in its presentations which is ap-
propriate to the nature of its audience. Musical fine
in is not the exclusive property or the music de—
partment, as Miss hedpatli so beautliiiuy proved,
It is awnilly senseless to waste money and extort on
the sensationalism of mere physical proximity lo
"name" entenainers when perrormers of Miss Red<
poui's quality are available,

Many Feel Overwhelming Helplessness

Say Students Ailer

Five Grinnell students who par-i,
liclpated iu inner—city work prol
jects last summer and this spring
related their experiences in a panel ,
discussion Sunday night in the
South Lounge of the Forum.

“A City pi Necessity,” a iilm den
picting the Chicago inner city, pre~
faced the discussion. Panel mem-
bers were Jay Wllliams, moderar
tor, Bob Robnett, Anne Spragiie,
Delabian Rice, and Gretchen
Roecker.

One impression of inner-city hie;
that the panel stressed was the
overwhelming hopelessness ion by
many people who live under condi-
tlol'ls they cannot escape. Miss
sir-:lgiie cited the example in a
man all relief who, like many Otllr
ei-s, desperately wanted [0 iihrl a
job, but couldn't, because “there‘
simply are not enough jobs, even
{or those who are trained.” Em-
pliisning the lack of mobility con»
homing hiahy prospective workers, [
she added, "HOW can you try (Di
work who you can’t even get to‘,

re they're offering i "

According lo Miss Roecker, poor
education is also responsible lor
in s hopelessness, especially for
Kean c . ieI]. She said, ' he ed-

 

lnner-Ciiy Vacation

ucation they're getiing is atrocious.
They’re just moving iliem ibruiigh.
And this is a fact at his in the in-
ner city."

Miss Rice said, “We have an

impression oi the poor as obvious»
ly poor and unintelligent. but they
are oilen nothing but victims of
Circumstances. People in this con-

dition are not typical: they are not
statistics; they are not all alike.
We can't know their thoughts and
their potential.”

“We finally realized that all the

cliches we’ve heard are true. It's

one thing to believe It intellectual-

ly and ancmer to believe ii emc-
tionnlly,” Williams added.

“l didn’t want to hear stories
about how bad things were,” Rob-
“because tlley were

net: said,
pretty bad. But I'm glad I (lid
hear, because I didn't know this
problem existed."

Chicago has tried to eliminate a

part at its slum problem by build-
ing new highrise apartments. How;

ever, according to Miss Roecker,
“moving the people min high-rise
apartments doesn’t solve a thing,

it just compacts the people and
moves the slums behind a nice

fmllt.’ '

Tu the Editor:

We have just returned from the
March in Washington to end the
war in Viet Nam sponsored by Stu~

dents for a Democratic Society.
Riding the long bus trip with us
were concerned people troni vari—
ails areas o1 iowa and Nebraska.
Tile bus was not tilled because of
student apathy and because people
dropped out without warning less
than five hours beiore the bus
was to depart; and therefore, a
number or students who were go-
ing to Washington tor other rea-
sons were accepted.

In Washington we oined with
20.000 (ligure quoted in the Wash.
ington Post), other students and
adults to protest United states
policy in Viet Nam. The march
was not intended to propose any
particular long—range solution, but
rather to express our discontent
with the perilous immediate situa—
tion and to encourage negotiations.

president Johnson, in his John

Stance of Protest

Hopkins speech, stated that he was
willing to negotiate unconditional-
ly with North and South Viet Noni.
At the same time, however, he
stepped up our bombings of North
Viet Nam producing conditions
definitely not conducive to iiogotia»
tions, Furthermore, his offer to
negotiate should have been made
as well to the National Liberation
Front (against whom we are tight
ing),

By the slogan of the march ”end
the war in Viet Nam,” we do not
mean. unconditional withdrawal.
,We desire a cease-fire and the tics
sihle neutralization of Viet Nam,
and free elections under the aus-
pices of the United Nations. we
cannot realize the goal oi having
a tree selldetermining Viet Nam
by ravaging its countryside with
bonnhs, napalm, and all oi the oth-
er instruments of war.

Students

The Women’s Strike for Peace
brought two special trains and
several busloads of people from
New York. Various unions
identified themselves With ban-
ners as did teachers’ and farm
organizations. Also in the crowd
were college professors, cler-
gymen, local residents with
their families and sympathetic
tourists,

Tile crowd picketed the White
House in the morning, then
marched to the Sylvan Theater,
behlnd the Washington Monu~
ment, for a rally in the after-
noon. Guest speakers were I,
F. Stone, editor of I. F. Stone’s
Weekly, and Sen. Ernest Gruela
ing (D., Alaska). Stone de.
nounced the fact that the na-
non is expected to consent
lblindly to administration deci-
lslons on Viet Nam.

RoberL Moses, spokesman
tor the civil rights movement
in Mississippi, also addressed
the group.

Moses related injustice in the
South to the continuing war in
Viet Nam. He suggested that
those who deliberately plan and
execute murders of Negroes
and civil rights workers are
not moral idiots, but products
of a society which condones
bombing and killing in accord-
ance with a policy which is ill-
defined and the appropriate-
ness of which is dubious.

Interspersed between the
speeches was entertainment by
Judy Collins, Joan Baez, Phil

 

Ochs, and the Freedom Voices.

What urns do Air Force scientists get involved in?
Practically any you can name. Of course the principal
.im oi Air Force research is to expand our aerospace

Crossett's Non-Fine Arts Non-Lecture
Downtrods Uptempo ‘Downtown’

By Connie Simon

Elbows resting atop a huge
stereo record player imported lor
the occasion. John Crﬂssett
(classical languages) delivered his
promised “non-lecture" Wedncs
day night in the North Lounge.

Crossett delighted his assembled
“nonaudrence” with a warning
torblddlng note-taking, and ex-
pressed his desire to make the non-
lecture as non-academlc as pos-
sible. In particular, he said, “There
will be no academic jargon used
here.”

He began by distributing mimeo-
graphed papers among the listene
ers. The papers were copies of
Tony Hatch’s many-splendored
pop song. “Downtown," which he
used as the theme Elf his nun-lec~
ture.

“I won't be here long and I
won't do this again" were Cros-
sett’s words as he began his hour-
long satire on Everything. He pro-
ceeded with hilarious abandon to
analyze the song’s lyrics in “mock-
intelleetualese," equating “Down-
lawn” to ”the return to the anb"
and “mobility and freedom of
American Society.”

At lecture's end Grossett ﬂipped
on the juke box version of “Down—
town" tor the third time that even-
ing saying that he “wanted to

No Campaign Probe
Says SGA Session

By Ted Lemaire

Most of this week’s Advisory
Councll meeting was devoted to
discussing a motion made by Les-
ter Tobias to investigate campaign
tactics.

His motion, as amended by Steve
Kent, would have established a
committee to investigate “the costs
incurred by a candidate tor the or
[ice of SGA President, and the
means of reducing them, and the
inadaquacy at present methods for
regulating SGA elections; . . that
this committee recommends leg-
islation in these problem areas,
should it deem legislation neces-
sary."

Dan Bucks introduced an amend-
ment virtually disregarding cam-
paign methods and focusing on the
problem of financial costs to he in-
vestigated by the ﬁnance commit-
tee, Uf which he is a member.

The Bucks amendment was
passed by a Vote of 9-5. Tobias
stated alter the defeat, “This is a
direct threat and insult to the ex-
isting student government system
and its supposed democracy."

The amended motion passed
by a 16-1 vote.

The election reform legislation
arose from previous campaigns in
which alleged threats caused a can»
dictate to withdrawi The Tobias
mutlon would have curbed such
practices.

According to SGA President
Jerry Goddard, such incidents are
more regrettable for individual
students than for the strident body
and the school.

About the questlon of threats
Goddard said, “No threat has ever
prohibited anyone from running.
Threats don’t cut the mustard on
this campus. I don‘t believe this
is a tenable assertion.”

BaseballTeam Wins Doubleheader
Only to Drop Two laierjn Week

The Grinnell baseball team
started the conference season by
first winning u doubleheader on
Saturday and then losing a double~
header on Tuesday. The Pioneers
beat the Monmouth team twice on
some tight pitching and some gifts
from the Monmouth pitchers. The
Pioneers could only muster two
hits in the doubleheader but still
won 32 and Hi. The SECOnd game
was a nohitter by Denny Hanssen.

Against Cornell the Pioneers again
could only get two hits but this
time they were not so fortunate
and lost 1-0 and 24).

Against Monmouth the Pioneers
scored all their runs on walks and
errors. in the first game the Mon-
mouth pitcher Walked six batters
in the rourth inning to give Grin-
nell its three runs. Monmouth
scored in the first on an error,
Itolen base, sacrifice, and a single
and once in the fifth on a walk and
I long double to left. Dave Schulz
went all the way for the Pioneers
on the mound allowing seven hits,
striking out four, and walking only
two.

in the second game Grinnell
scored the only run of the contest
in the second inning on an error
and three walks. No other Pioneer
runner, though, was able to get
past second base. Vern Robinson
had the only hit of the game, a
sixth inning single.

Denny Hanssen, in pitching his
no»hirter. overpowered Monmouth
with his fastball. He struck out 10
and allowed only four walks. Mons
mouth had seven baserlmners, two
of which gut to third, but Denny
was tough in the clutch and choked
out all [he rallies.

Against Cornell the pitching was
almost as good but unfortunately
the Pioneers could not push across
any runs. Grinnell again only got
two hits in the doubleheader but
this time the opponents did not sup-
ply the Pioneers with any gift
runs.

Dave Schatl pitched the first
game at Cornell and only gave up
four hits but the Rams nicked him
for an unearned run in the first on
two hits and an error and that was
the end of the scoring for that
game John Shierholz got the nnlyl

 

Pioneer hit in the sixth and in that
inning was the only Grinnell runner
to get in third in the entire ball
game.

Denny Hanssen pitched the sec-
ond game and gave up only four
hits but was beaten by two un-
earned runs in the lourth inning.

The Pioneer hit in this game was
notched by Mike Smiler. Again in
this game the Pioneers could get
only one runner, .lohn Shierhulz, to
third base.

The Pioneers Will continue their
season next week With five away
games. On Tuesday Grinnell tra»
vels to C09 for it doubleheader, on
Friday with a single game at
Monmouth, and on Saturday with a
doubleheader at Knox.

SCARLET AND RACK

—:- Animal Life -:-

After the wild success of the
BurnstineGrossman scene from
Arthur Miller’s After the Fill in
the coffee house last Saturday
night, the 1M chairmen have
caught the “coffee house fever." 1
don't Want to let the cat out of the

'bag, or anything like that, but now

in the planning stage is an exhibi-
tion lM softball game to be put
on there. The field dimensions will
be somewhat abbreviated because

of the limited space, and there will
be certain ground rules — like
anything through a plate glass win-
dow is an automatic home run.
The cover charge will be $32.50 per
person, mostly to covcr the cost
of damages. i understand one of
the most immediate problems is
figuring out how to protect the
pitcher from being clobbered when
the batter swings.

If the exhibition softball game is
successful, and undoubtedly it Win
be, it will ripen the door to I Vir-
tually endless array of possibilities
for our magnificent, john-size u-
presso palace. Alrmdy in the plan-
ning stage is an idea to make the
coffee house the green oi a 10th
hole addition to the gait course.
One clever Grinnellian has sug-
gested that we not call it a green.
but rather a red. (Keep calm, you
young Republicans — he’s now

 

being investigated by the John
Birch Society). The tee~oif area
will be on the 10th avenue softball
field, and the 1M golfers will fol-
low an interesting route over
Cowles, through Darby, and into
the Forum, Sorry. lovers, this new
course addition is strictly for the
use or our golfers.

Who knows what the future may
hold? Perhaps as each season
comes upon us, we may see in the

coffee house no football, volley-
ball. basketball. howling, or, if the
coffee cups are enlarged or little
bit, swimming.

But getting to events at hand
—— softball is developing into quite
an open scramble, As or this writ-
ing, the only two undefeated teams
are Clark and East. i suppose if
things keep up the way they have
been, the winner of the Clark—
East game may very well deter-
mine the winner of_the softball
crown. Actually, of course, as the
result of our tnmendout field fa-
cilities, the winning 1M team will
turn out to be the one with the
most experienced mountain climb-
ers and spelunkers,

And with IM golf soon to be
played. 1 leave you with that oh!
quoted sentiment: “To each red
rose yondery Bees leave our sweet-
est scents."

only a second behind the school
record set last spring. The other
winning relay team was the sprint

Al?
F .r

By Steve Casey

The Grinnell home baseball season started last weekend,
and the opener was one long yawn. The game seemed about
as exciting as an 8:00 humanities class on Monday morning,
What kind of baseball is it when the Pioneers can muster
only two hits in fourteen innings? A pretty dull kind i my
book. "

Some strange quirk of fate brought me late to the game
in the bottom of the fourth inning with the score 10 in favor
of Monmouth. So far, so good. I then sat back and saw the
real “excitement" of the game when Gl‘innell “pounded out”
three runs on six walks.

Then, of all things, in the top of the fifth I saw a hit. I
did not realize that the gods on Olympus had been so kind to
me — to let me see this great action — until I watched more.
The rest of the game was like watching a Met-Houston thriller
on TV.

Even to the most casual observer, as I was then, it was
easy to see that the poor Monmouth pitcher did not have it
in that big fourth inning. But he finished the inning as the
Monmouth coach paced on the sidelines. After watching three
Pioneers walk to first base, it took real courage for the pitcher
to stick out the next three walks. For this great dis lay of
courage, the coaches of the nine other Midwest con erence
teams ought to give him a reward —- another year of eligi-
bility so he can continue to pitch against their clubs.

After seeing those two exciting innings, I forced myself
out to the golf course (to play golf). When I came around
and caught a glimpse of the game from the course, nothing
could have seemed more unappealing to me.

The Pioneers did pull some tricky maneuvers that in-
trigued me, though. First, they had no first base coach, and
second, they had Morgan Michel as third base coach. I will
not deny that Morg is a big morale booster, but the third
base coach is a responsible job not ’to be filled by a cheer-
leader. And even IM teams have first base coaches.

There must be some underlying reason for that piece
of strategy. Coach Pfitsch probably figures if a Pioneer gets
a hit, he is good enough to be his own coach. Of course if most
of the runners get to first on walks, they do not need a coach.
Then if the runner gels to third, he needs somebody to wake
him up, because he has probably got weary-eyed from watch-
ing the Grinnell batters. And Michel is certainly a person
who can wake up the runner.

When I heard Dennis Hanssen had pitched a no-hitter,
I was sorry I missed it, naturally, but the thought of having
to sit through seven innings with only one Grinliell hit
changed my mind. I was glad I had played golf. 1 almost could
picture how Grinnell got its run—walk, walk, walk, and error.
As it turned out, my prediction was right, except it was in
reverse order.

Unfortunately, I hit as many good balls on the golf
course as the Pioneers did on the diamond, so I ended up
with a poor score. But it would have taken about a 75 for the
nine for me to have been sorry for missing the rest of the
doubleheader.

Don’t get me wrong. I am happy the Pioneers won. But
if this is the way they are going to be playing for the rest
of the year, it is going to be a long season for the fans.

Freshmen lose First Game to Simpson;
luck of Hitting Power Hurts the Team

By Jim Wilson

The (rush baseball team last its
opening game of the season to
Simpson College Tuesday 4—3. The
Pioneers fell behind 1-0 in the first
inning on one of two unearned runs
alloted to Simpson. The other two
Simpson runs came on a home run
with one man on in the fifth in-
ning.

Greg Dean was the starting
pitcher for the Pioneers and was
charged with the loss. Dean gave
up only five hits and struck out
eleven batters. He also contributed
to the Grinnell cause with a home
run in the fourth inning. Dean was
relieved by Greg Erickson in the
seventh inning. Erickson was able
to hold Simpson scoreless but the
Pioneers were unable to bring the
needed runs home,

hits, a home run by Dean and sin<
gles by Jim Kinyorl and Dave Mar-
ion. The {rash scored their other
two runs in the seventh inning
when a Wild throw to second base
allowed the two Pioneers, who had
reached base on walks, to score.

The team will try to get into
the winning column when they
play Coe next Wednesday at Coo.
