VOL. LXXIX

Faculty Ends PE Requirement By 51-32 Vote

NO. 7

By John Pepper
and Tim Purges

Monday’s vote to abolish the
Physical Education require-
ment for graduation demon-
strated to the satisfaction of
most that the woodworkaround
here is at least as full ofAbo-
litionists as of the vicious re-
actionaries which the heritary
wisdom of campus politics
imputes.

The vote reversed the faculty
vote of two weeks previous to
maintain the requirement in a
lessened form. That meeting
was poorly attended, in part
because many liberal faculty
members hadassumedthatthe
requirement wouldbeabolishr
ed as a matter of course and
logic persuant to the Jones-
Clotfelter academic reforms.
Hence, they didn‘t bother to
show up, and the requirement
was retained by a 36-31 vote.
Two weeks of intensive lobbyr
ing followed, with the result
that a few votes changed and
about twenty abolitionists we-
re moved toattend, pushing the
abolution motion to a 51-32
victory.

It was necessary for the rec
consideration of the vote that
one person who had originally
voted with the majority pro
pose anewvote. Charles Clear
ver got up and spoke in this
role, saying that he had chi
anged his mind in the matter.
He said that his original vote
had been a reaction against
what he termed“Puritanism"
which cultivates mind at the
expense of body. He said that
his mind had been changed
because he felt all good things
need not be legislated with the
threat of witholding the B.A.

A brief debate followed, with
sporadic muttering-s of ”quesr
tion" from the perifery of the

DECEMBER 11, I970

auditorium. Debate recapitur
lated previous discussion,
with Phillip Kint-ner saying
that the retention of this single
requirement would make a
mockery of the work the fac-
ulty had done on academicre-
form. Coach Pfitsch said that
the PE Department did not
want sympathy votes, and that
the issue must be decided on
its merits alone. But he also
added that it implied “unfairr
ness", in sports at least, to
lose and then demand another
game “just to see if you can’t
win this time."

Nonetheless, the vete was
taken (by secret ballots, no
less) and the proposal to abo-
lish was carried by theafore-
mentioned margin.

Henceforth, no student will
be denied a diploma due to
his non— completion of the Phys
sicalrEducation requirement,
seniors included. TWO hours of
credit will be, given to those
who complete the syllabus of
the reformed requirement
passed at the previous meet-
ing.

Perhaps the most significant
segment of the meeting was
President Leggett‘s address
to the faculty, which will pro-
bably have wide rcpercusr
sions.

Liberalization, he said, is
noc about to be an acrossr
the-board phenomenon. The
administration must attempt
to control the ﬂow of students
from previously‘ required ar
eas into others. This will be
done by the advising system
and by close control of class
sizes. This means, among
other things, that students
must expect to find more and
earlier closing-out of class
sections.

Given the priority system of
putting seniors and majors in

GRINNE LL, IOWA 501 12

to courses before lower class-
men, etc., we can probably
expect increased freshman
dissatisfaction, unless more
and better freshman courses
are designed. Leggett did not
mention this problem: and it
probably will be the respon-
sibility of the Freshman Year
Committee, which is now be-
ing formed. As the semester's
debate draws to a emse, the
problems ofamdemicreform,
far from being settled, have
really scarcely begun.

loewi Coerces SGA 'I'oWithhold
Funds To Victims In Pakistan

by Don Dagenuis

On Thursday, Dec. 3. the Sen-
ate once again gathered togen
ther for one of those dinner
meetings to discuss the pres-
sing issues of the day over
those delicious SAGA culinary
delights. The only major ac-
tion was to designate the pro-
ceeds from tonight's SAGA
fast to the Martin Luther King
Scholarship Fund.

The Senate had earlier dccir
ded, in Andy Loewi’sabsence,
to give the proceeds to the
Pakistan Relief Fund. Under
pressure from Loewi, how—
ever, they changed their
minds. The incident brought
to question the ability of the
Senate to make intelligent de-
cisions in the absence of Mr.
Loewi, or, perhaps, whether
Mr. Loewi feels the Senate
can make rational decisions
in his absence.

Most SGA activity since that
time has been behind the sce-
nes: the selection of subcomr
mittees for the Student Servi-
ces committee (it's always
good to increase the bureaus
cracy whenever possible), and
selection of student members
for the Freshman Year com‘
mittee, which will determine
the nature of the Freshman
Tutorial program.

The Housing Committee has

been about the onlyactivearm
of the bureaucracy lately. Ch-
airman Ric MacDowell re»
ports that the committee has
been discussing the possibil-
ities of (I) having the room
draw before House President
elections, then havingthe pre-
sidents elected by individual
dorms; (2) making Dibble and
Smith annexes into blocks of
rooms which could be drawn
by groups of students; (3) 31.
lowing juniors to live off-
campus, and (4) expanding the
number ofco-ed dorms, inclu-
ding dorms cored by rooms
rather than by ﬂoors. The re
sults of the recently distribur
ted questionnaire are now be-
ing tabulated by MacDowell at
night, into the weehours ofthe
morning. He hopes to complete
the job before Christmas br'
eak. Little action has been
taken by the committee in the
way of official recommendar
tions. Such activity will pro-
bably wait until next semes-
ter.

Other than that, SGA, like
everyone else these days, is
worrying about suchminiscule
matters as last-minute papers
and final examinations. It
seems that even political 3C,
tivists are realizing that the
most important priority is the
small matter of making your
grades.

GeorgeHarrison Surpasses Paul
And John In Music, Philosophy

by Ron Medvin

”It is not just that George has
surpassed all the individual
disks issued to date by Paul,
John and Ringl. Both music—
ally and philosophically, he
has produced one of the out-
side rock albums in years."
(Time, Nov. 30) This is quite
a statement, but what is more
amazing is that is true] Geo-
rge Harrison‘s new triple 31,
burn is fantastic. It is as if
George sat silently within the
Beatles only waiting to pro-
duce this album. He has sur-
prised many people, for no
one expected that George had
so much talent.

The name of the album is
"All Things Must Pass", and
it contains ls new Harrison

"1C” Will Rise Again

by J.C. Labowitz

(The events that follow, are
true, and only the names have
been changed to protect the
innocent.)

I was sitting in my room last
Friday, meditating as to the
situation in the world today.
when I decided to go'on over
to the post office and pick up
my copy of the Scarlet and
Black. On the way down from
North Campus, Iwent past an
elm tree that was burning but
seemingly was not being con-
sumed. I thought that this was
somewhat strange, but I hur-
ried on to the p.o. When I get
there, I found thatall the mail-
boxes except mine were
smeared with what appeared
to be lamb’s blood. I again
found this strange. I then ope
ened my mailbox and found a
piece of divinity fudge and a
copy of the S and B. Thepaper
seemed to be glowing like a
coal from great heat, yet I
was able to hold onto it with-
out being burned. As I headed
up the stairs, Inoticeda re-
ceipt that had fallen on the
floor, a receipt that was for
thirty pieces of silver paid to

someone named “Enoch Sno-
key".

After reading the paper, I
realized that I was, in a sit
nation that required a little
help from my friends. 501
called together 12 of my f-r’
iends for dinner that night,
and we talked about what was
happening to me.Theyadvised
me to “hang loose".

The next morning I discov-
ered that my mother had arr
rived unexpectedly during the
night. I also had a headache
that was like a weight bearing
down on my head. Igota phone
call from a few of the ROTC
cadets, who insisted that I
come over and play cards or
shoot dice or something. As
I was preparing to leave, I
noticed that the sky was get-
ting very dark, and stormy,
so I took along an umbrella.
Before I left, I wrote this
column so I wouldn't forget
about it and have to have one
of my friends write it for me.
I did want to add one more
thing - I am looking forward
to next semester when I hope
to rise again to new journal-
istic heights.

 

songs, one song written by
Dylan, from his ”New Morn-
ing" album, and one song
whole lyrics are Dylan‘s and
whose music is Harrison's.
And then there is a two side
jam session with some “see-
end-rate" musicians such as
Ginger Baker, Eric Clapton,
Dave Mason, Billy Preston,
Bobby Keys, Klaus Voormann
and morelll The jams are gr-
eat. One side is a rousing
1950's pure rockrandrrollso~
und. The other side is a more
"modern" sound with Harri-
son, Clapton, and Masonplayr
ing some great guitar solos.
Harrison’s guitar work on
this entire album is excellent.

Presented with the rumr
ors of faculty dismissals
that have been circulating
about campus recently,
Deans Waldo Walker and
Joseph Wall had an identi-
cal reaction: ”no com-
ment.”

Dean Wall explained that
the staffingsituationis still
very much unclear, even
though faculty members
with multiryear contracts
or more than two year's
service must be/ given a
year's notice before they
can be dismissed and those
with singleryear contracts
and two years at the college
must be netified byDecem»
her 1, since those who have
only been here one year
need only be netified by
March 1.

Dean Walker pointed out
that five faculty members
are here this year on one-
year terminating contracts
which expire automatically
at the end of the year. Dean
Wall emphasized thatmany
of this year's dismissals
will come solely due to fin-
ancial reasons. Thcy ex
pected final decisions tobe
reached by the beginning
of second semester.

Replies To Freshman, Kintner, And Keepnews

Calls Preps’Proposals "Incredible”

To the editor:

This letter is in response to
last week's article by three
freshman students concerning
the "irrelevance" ofthe Grins
nell education.

First of all, I fail to see how
these students, with theirvast
thirteenrweek experience of
the collegiate educationalsys-
tern, can assume that they
have given it a fair trial and
found it wanting. The mind-
expanding project ofa lé-crer
dit independent on death and
insanity somehow does not
strike me as a viable alter-
native to the type of education
which Grinnell is offering.

Few reasons for the propo-
sed radical change are offer-
ed. Semantic phrases like "a
more accurate representation
of society based upon mutual
dependency between students"
prove little more than thefact
that the writers are certainly
not hesioant in using their ir-
relevant education to get ac-
ross a radical point. I see
little justification for the pros
ject other than an unsupport-
ed assumption that “learning

process," and an attempt to
get academic credit for wast»
ing a good deal of tuition “,0,
hey.

In our society, there are al»
ternative directions one can
choose for his life to take. One
of those is getting an educa-
tion by going to a small libero
al-arts college. This is the
choice these students have
made; if it does not fit their
plans, then i would suggest
that the college environment
is not where they belong.

At the risk of sounding like
a dyed-inrwool conservative,
it seems to me that the pre-
sent Grinnell education can be
a relevant learning experience
if the student himself wishes
to make it that. These fresh~
men, Iposit, aren't willing to
meet it halfway. In fact, they
really haven't had time to try
it at all.

Perhaps the most incredur
lous statement of an article
filled wlth incredulous state*
ments is the following choice
quote about the purpose of the
College: "it seems more in-
terested in keepingitselfalive
than providing its students
with an education which edu-
cates them." It seems to me
that if the college were not
here a very small amount of
education. educating anybody,
would indeed take place.

The article could perhaps be
passed off as a rather incred-
ible exercise in naivete and
radical idealism. I find, howV
ever, that it bothers me a
good deal more than that, for
i find in it an amazing refusal
to be aware of the reality of
the world in which we are liv-
ing, and the radicalrchange-
for - the ~ sake~ of» radical ,
change syndrome so wpimlof
youth movements today. I
would have hoped that Grins
nell would be free of that.

Describes laughing Jog From Outside:
Clever, Amusing, lngenious--Hideous

To the editor:

Pretty cute that "laughing
jag". Clever, snide and cyni-
cal as you sat in your ivory
tower of Goodnow mockingthe
futile scurrying of us inner
cents (except for Paul, may
he flunk his Fisiks!) Now let
me tell you how it felt to be
on the receiving end of this
clever amusing and ingenious
little jag.

2:00 in the morning: Outside
the wind booms through naked
trees and the first frozen ﬂa-
kes come streaming out ofthe
dark north. I am awakened by
laughter. Not light-hearted or
chortling or even guffaws.

loewi Replies 0n PF:
"Not A Mouthpiece”

To the Editor:
I would like to take this op.
portunity to respond briefly
to Mr. Kintner‘s letter of last
week. When I spoke in favor
of the modified physical edu-
cation requirement before the
faculty, 1 did so because I
feared for thepossible demise
of intercollegiateathleticsand
campus recreation in the event
of P.E. staff cutbacks. lwas
later assured that those pro*
grams would not suffer were
the requirement to be abol-
ished, and so changed my poe
sition. As we faculty has now
done away with the P.E. re—
quirement, no harm was done.
I at no time stated, as Mr.
Kinmer suggests, that “the
students were not unfavorable
to a F.E. requirement." Wh‘
enever I speak before thefac-
ulty, or elsewhere, 1 speak as
an elected representative of
the student body, but not as a
mouthpiece for student opina
ion. For anyone to attempt the
latter would be pure folly.

"Bitter Personal

To the editor:

Peter Keepnews signed his
letter last week "in the spirit
of good, clean, healthy enter
tainment." Unfortunately, he
does not seem to set the same
standards for his entertainr
ment as forhisargumentation,
for the letter was little more
than a bitter personal attack
on LC. Labowitz. ler. Keeps
news is truly interested in
responding to criticism, as he
says he is, and if he plans to
answer the numerous come
plaints about his committe
this year in the same way he
answered those of J.C. last
week, he has set for himself
an ambitious task. For he will
have to make as many replies
as there are critics, answer

beautiful HarrisonrDylan love
song, and Harrison’s gently
whining passages are beauti-
ful, Then, on "Wuh-Wah”(for
Peterson7), Harrison‘s guitar
has the vital driving beat wh—
ich he is so adept atperform~
ing.

There are some surprises on
the album. First of all, Geo‘
rges' lyrics are filled with
optimism and the album is
filled with his love of God
"Forgive me Lord/Please
those years when I ignored
you/Forgive them Lord/Tn
ose that feel they can't af-
ford you." And the song wh-
ich was put on a 45mm is
entitled "My Sweet Lord" is
a rousing gospelrty'pe song,
complete with backrup by the
George O'Hara—Smith Sings
ersl (This is really George
dubbed over and Over about 20
times.) This song sounds am-
azingly like “Oh Happy Day"
and it is impossible to remain
seated when playing it. ”Hear
Me Lord" is another song of
the same type; this is one that
Joe Cocker could really do
well (nor to takeanythingaway
from Harrison). “Wahrvllah”
is a driving song with strong
dissonant chords similar to
"I Want to Tell You" on Re—
volver. ”Apple Scruffs” is
a "tounge-inrcheek” bouncy
son . gharrlson may be spear

king of his fellow Beatles when
he sings, “AppleScruffs/ How
I love you")

There are few faults, if any
on this album. Phil Spector
coeproduced it with Harrison,
however, he has learned his
lesson. Unlike "Let It Be",
he does not overload this air
bum with orchestras filled
with violins and trumpets. Whr
on there is an occasional vio-
lin, it is subtle and fits perr
fectly with the song, suchias
the violin solo in "Isn't It A
Pity". The violins so closely
resemble Harrison's guitar
that it is difficult to tell them
apart.

This album is justin time for

And it’s not too "expensive;

The IM Chairmen’s duties
concerning volleyball are to
1), see that the netsareput up
on time 2), supply the volley-

record the results of the
games are available. Either
Craig Gordon, or Dick Pipe,
or both were negligent in all
three of the above duties to
some degree. We feel that the
Hvi Chairmen have entered into
a binding agreement to serve
the students of the College.
They have breached that
agreement, and if they do not
intend to honor itin the future,
they should resign from the
job of IM Chairman, andallow
someone willing to accept the
duties to take over.

There seems to be something
lacking in the hallrbased syS‘

There has been some talk {1*

Breast-stroke relay, (Mark
Williams, Thomas Gibbions,
and C.D. Meyer); and the 400
yd. free relay, (Mike Daley,
Swacky, Ward, and Rollins).

The meet was not all drab,
as Grinnell introduced some
new twists to its Grinnell tra-

ents, History Majors, Cleve-
land Hall Freaks, etc. Instead
of playing with the guys you
happen to live with, you could
play with the guys you do
things with, the guys you would
like to get out on the basketr
ball court and jag with. Any
hall could still organizea team
if it liked, but there would be
more freedom, which is what
everybody seems towant these
days.

I think this is basically a
sound idea. Sure, itwouldpre-
sent lots of problems, like
some teams are going to be a
lot more skillful and compe»
titive than others, and the tier
centralization of power is go-
ing to necessitate a lot more
work organizing the sport; but
the IM Directors seem willing
to give it a whirl. It may just
be the best thing that has hit
Grinnell intramurals since the
days of the Smith Machine.

ditions (7). Coach Obe wore
his new Tie-dyed Trshirt of
numerous colors. On the back
it pronounces him Coach of
the "Grinnell Freaks” much
to the Team's delight. Truly
a Grinnell Experience to bee
hold.

Other humorous activities
included trophies that were
small mugs, that Coach
Pfitsch thought might be in~
ducive to consumption of ale
coholic beverages. Diane Win~
ters gave out appropriate ins
structions of use as shehand-
ed them out, though.

Outstanding performances
were turned in by both divers,
probably because no one told

Pontoon he was supposed to
lose. C.D. Meyer came out
for the team on Wednesday,
after a year layoff, and turned
in two outstanding performs
ances, being the winningstim-
ulus on the 400 yd. Medley
and 300 yd. Breaststroke re-
lays. In between his events he
went to Loose and watched the
football game on the tube.
All in all it was a good meet
but the team lost to a better
team. The Aqua-jocks have
all Christmas vacation to lick
their wounds and try to do it
right the next time in the

BB Team loses A Few,
But Still Has Hopes

It's getting so thateither this
writer should stop making
predictions, or Grinnell‘s
teams should stop pussyfoot-
ing around and start living up
to their potential. My record
as a prophet has now gone to
0’3 (1 don‘t think i could beat
the Bear) since the Grinnell
disasters at Millikin Univer-
sity and at Central. Ian-l told
that l underestimated the Milr
likin five (that‘s what happens
when one operates without an
effective scouting staff). ln~
deed, now I'm told that Grin-
nell simply is not in the same
class as Millikin and that,
were the Millikinites in the
Midwest Conference, lheyWOr
uld dominate year after year.
It is somewhat mollifying to
know that one has been crushr
ed by class.

The Central game was an—
other matter. Perhaps the Pia
oneers were just ”down”from
their devastation by Millikin.
At any rate, even the players
admit they had a bad night (as
was born out by the box scor
res: Grinnell had nobody sco~
ring in double figures, while
Central had three people sco—
ring 20 or more),andthatthey
should have won. Unfortun‘
Yately, even losses that should
have been wins go down in the
record book as losses.

The next event on the Hoopr
sters' itinerary is the Holiday
Tournament at Colorado. As T

said last week, the only come
petition here, aside fromalti-
rude, is Knox. Thus, I shall
stick my neck out one more
time and renew my prediction
of a Grinnell victory. The
Pioneers should knock Knox
for the championship.

In spite of the disasters at
Millikin and Central, thereare
several factors which justify
my continued faith in the plays
ers of Grinnell. Among these
are “Kraut" Kraut, Greg
"the Beck" Beckman,Quinton
“Super—Q" Phea. and
” “ Patterson. Th—
ere is no doubt thatGrinnell’s
performance against Millikin
was impaired by the absence
of Patterson, out with the
SAGA flu, and of Fhea, who
was unable to attend anumber
of early practices. Both were
back for the game against
Central and performed solid-
ly, with Super-Q winding up
as one of the high scorers for
Grinnell. As they play more,
they will improve consider”
ably and be of invaluable ser-
vice to the Pioneers. The
Kraut and Beclcman were high
scorers for Grinnell against
Millikin with 25 and lUpoints,
respectively, and both came
back against Central to give
strong performances inspite
of the 83* 50 loss. Grinnell can
still win it all, if they start
playing the way they should.
