' 228 Seniors Rescue Degrees Today

[yon Tells G ads:
Education Will be
lifetime Concern

Commencement speaker E. Wilson
Lyon told the Class of 1966 that “think-
ing about education will be your liietime
responsibility.” He added that “you have
more than you realize now in prepara-
tion as ‘tuture rulers of state and na-
tion.‘ "

Lyon, who is president of Pomona Col-
lege in Calilnrnia, delivered an address
entitled “This We Possess” to the gradu<
ating seniors this afternoon. He discussed
the extent or higher education today, and
the role or the liberal arts college in pan
ticuiar.

Lyon said that while attempts to read
the iuture are hazardous, “one [act
about our society is abundantly evident.
Our country will be increasingly occu-
pied with high education and everything
that pertains to it.”

He said that “in extent and volume
what we are embarking upon dwaris
even the rise of the medieval universi-
ties in Europe, historically regarded as
the greatest age of higher education.”
Education iS now too important to
handle essentially in the sense of the
personal.

Lyon noted his personal experiences
with the American Council of Education.
British Universities and a recent convo-
cation at the Center tor the Study or
Democratic Institutions in Los Angeles,
He cited all three as examples of the
current discussions over “the organi7a-
[ion of higher education, the size of en-
rollments, the nature of the curriculum,
and the concept or what a professor
should be and do." .

The value of the liberal arts college is
that “it provides the ideal opportunity

with Walter Lippman in advn»
eating a “liberal education
which would be Concerned with
what Plato calls 'the royal
ncience’, the science that needs
to he possessed by the rulers of
the ﬂute."

Lyon (old iha Class of '66 that
"you are better rulers tor hav—
ing received your education in
this intimate envimnment in
which teaching and Lhe Close
relation of iaculty members and
Students are the primary ab-
}ectives of the institution."

The aims of colleges like Gl’m—
nell and Pomona, according in
Lyon, is to provide such I
"close and continuous interplay
oi young and older minds in a
congenial and truitiul atmns~
phere."

Lyon concluded by telling the

graduates that they possessed
more than they realized in piep-
aratlon as iulure rulers, and
that “the purpose oi your col«
lege education hits been to
equip you to recognize the es
Sential and [0 know how 10 (lCal
with it. We have faith that you
can do this."

The title of the Speech, "This
We Possess,” was taken from
an article written by a Harvard
alumnus, Elljﬂl Notion, in 1957.
Norton had discussed the qua-
ity of his Harvard teachers by
saying that their excellence
only became obvious after I
number of years. Norton said
that his teachers “had I Xer-
vent enthusiasm ior finding and
propagating the truth as they
saw it." ,

In the article, Norton had con-
cluded that “much of what they
taught is gone, but this remains.
This we possess and far this w:

Gﬁhneﬂ Fhst

 

WALKING ON WATER Is what Steve Brintnell wished he could have done in the preliminary 44o yerd dash Friday
in the centerenee meet. in spite at the water. arintnnll clocked a 53.2 to fake first in his tlight. He pulled a muscle,
however. and didn't place in the tinnle Saturday. The only Grinnallian to place in the 440-yard dash was Bob We”
who tech e tearth. Chuck Porter cl Lawrence with a :50.3 was the centerence champion.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IN THE MUD during Friday's preliminary tlighrs, Mike sehwerrr was able
to clock the testest time in the 220-yard Low hurdles. He ran the event in
l25.7. Saturday, however. he only placed third in the tinels. The title went
to Chuck McKee et Lawrence with e time of 24.9.

day and Saturday were only able to take
third place, finishing behind Carleton
and Monmouth.

Grinnell, with 30 team points, took
more ﬁrst places than anyone else. Grin<
nell had tour lirsts, Carleton and Mon-
mouth had only one each. Carleton
scored 36 team points. Monmouth 34.

Placing first for Grinnell was the mile

relay team, Jeri Langham in the 880-
yard run and in the mile, and Tom Wood
in the javelin. Carleton took a ﬁrst in
the shot put and Monmouth took a tirst

in the 2-mlle run.
Grlnnell was hurt by the loss of Steve

Brinmall, who pulled a leg muscle. Brint-
nall had been expected to place high in
the 440-yard run and anchor the mile
relay team, Had Brinmall run In the
mile relay (an event ci-iiinell won any-
way), that would have released Lang-
ham to run in the 2-milc rim and perhaps
given Grmnell more points there.

Other Grilmellians placing were Doug

Dray, who took a third in the mlIe run
and a ﬁfth in the 2-miIe run. Mlke
Schwartz was able to pick up a third in
the 22!)»yard low hurdles and Bob Watt

 

iinished tourth in the 440»yard run. Jun
Buswell was the only other Pioneer get-
ting any points (higher than titth place).
He took ﬁfth in the broad Jump.

IN THE RAIN, Tom Wood still managed to throw the iaveHn l87'5‘/z ” for

e ecnlerenee chcrnpicnship in that event.
