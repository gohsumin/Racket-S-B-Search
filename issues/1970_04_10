Stein Heads,
Forum Coup

As probably everyone knoivs by
now, The Forum was taken over
by students last Saturday. Ap-
proximately 100 students, plus a
few RA’s and Mr, Crossett, who
was playing bridge, remained
alter the 1:3u AM. closing time
and listened to independence 398
or watched the movie in the
coflee-house, When many did not
leave at 1-30, Assistant Dean,
Dennis Donham was called, He
tlleli called Dean Kimbo, who
arrived at the Forum at ap
proximately 2:00 A M. He agreed
to leave Jon Stein in charge until
the students leit, many oi whom
remained until 3:30 to help clean
up.

The takeover is said to have
been the spontaneous reaction of
students’ objecting to the early
closing time. They ieel that
students shollld be allowed to
take responsibility for their
actions and for the building
without adult supervision. The
administration claims that this
would leave the college open to
liability suits.

Stein and other members of the
Student Forum Committee have
been meeting all week with
members of the administration
in order to have their proposals
considered These include
opening the building at to A M
Sundays, closing it at midnight
Sunday, 1 A M Monday thru
Thursday, and 2 AM. Friday and
Saturday with student supei»
Vision during the extended hours,
If decisions on these matters
have not been reached by
tomorrow, a mass sleeprln with
breakfast served in the coffee-
house is being considered.

Liberate The F orum/

Last week we were approached by a student
requesting the support of the newspaper in attempts
which were in progress to gain greater student con-
trol over the management of the Forum. A certain
amount of concern was expressed over the fact that
operation of the Cafe del Foro had been an uphill
battle. Forum personnel had allegedly been making
life difficult for the students who were responsible
for running the coffee house,

We were anxious to do whatever we could in
the way of casting light on dastardly deeds or issu-
ing a clarion call to action in support of a demon-
stration of a student sense of responsibility. We also
suggested a few possible avenues of approach to the
problem of securing greater freedom in operation
of the Cafe del Foro as well as other Forum services,

We think coffee and a place to relax are good
things at three o'clock in the morning as well as
any other time of the day. There are, however, cer-
tain logistical problems involved in keeping the
Forum open late, and we commend the students who
were seeking this goal for their foresight and pa-
tience in looking into these matters. Patience ran
out a little early, however, and the ugly spectre of
“confrontation polities" once more reared its head
on the Grin ell campus.

After visits with a few, but not all, of the ad-
ministrators on this campus who have some say
about the way the Forum is operated proved fruit-
less, it was decided that a demonstration of student
responsibility would have to take place unilaterally.
Accordingly, last Saturday night, when the Forum
was scheduled to close, the students did not leave.
Some of them kept dancing in North Lounge. Some
stayed to watch a movie in South Lounge. Others
just walked around picking up cigarette butts, con-
clusively proving to the administration that they
were responsible adults.

When we asked the students responsible for this
demonstration why it had taken place, they com-
plained with bitterness about the lack of immed-
iate response on the part of the administration to
their demands for longer Forum hours. On asking
questions here and there, we discovered that at no
time had President Leggett been contacted by these
students about their feelings. Since he neither locks
his door nor disconnects his telephone when he sees
students coming, and since he is, after all, the presi-
dent of this college, whose influence would do much
to change the mind of even the most recalcitrant of
administrators, we cannot help but feel that the
students left a few stones unturned when they took
their precipitate action.

Above and beyond the question of whether or
not the action of the students was carefully thought
out is a deeper problem which is far too often com-
pletely ignored in the heat of a desire for concerted
action. The end does not justify the means. This, at
least, we should be able to learn from a liberal ed-
ucation,

In the future, if students wish to demonstrate
their responsibility as adults, it would perhaps be
better if they deign to try reason before venting
their spleen, Otherwise, we would be forced to con-
clude that Aristotle was right when he said, “, .
the young are not fit to be students of political SCI-
ence. For they have no experience of life and con-
duct, and it is these that supply the premises and
subject matter of this branch of philosophy. And
moreover they are led by their feelings; so that they
will study the subject to no purpose or advantage,
since the end of this science is not knowledge but

action.”

Letters to the Editor . . .

To The Editors:

M the editorials you have
written, I have noticed two which
were about subjects with which
I am well acquainted. The pat-
tern in both was (a) to assert
“idols" which were untrue, and
which could easily have been
checked ior accuracy, and (b)
to base opinion on these unlrulhs.

The iirsl was some weeks ago
when you asserted that Miss
Edwards' group independent
project, under American Studies
rubric, excluded males. The
opinion based on this “tact" was
that students should not be ex-
cluded from independent projects
because of sex, i suppose that
you know by now that your [acts
were wrong, though I have seen
no retraction.

Your lead editorial on April 3
is based on two untrutlls rather
than one, First, you say that Mr,
Hancock was invited by CBS to
“come to Grinnell to help come
memorate Black Martyr’s Day ”
That, actually, is a compound
untruih, He was not invited by
CBS, nor was he awarc of Black
Martyr's Day. Then you say,
compounding untruth again, that
“Dean Wall, in presenting the
motion, said that the proposal
had been brought to him by
CBS.” He said that some students
had suggested the degree. In fact,
cas did not, nor were they aware
that such a proposal had been
presented -— at least the people
in CBS with whom I have talked
were not aware of it. These unr
lrulhs, however, are convenient
to your assertion that the faculty
was “pandering” to a minority
group

I also find your opinion, in this
later editorial, open to queslion
7 even if it had been based on
Iucis. Did you object to the
degrees gIVCH to the very young
pliinler and the very young editor
during the same weekend when

Dr. King got his? (There is a
very substantial question about
whether their contributions to me
culture are as important as Mr.
Hancock’s, butthatis yet another
matter.) The level of ac-
complishment oi Grinnell alumni
who have been awarded honorary
degrees is probably somewhat
lower than that oi outsiders; even
so, can you think oi any Grinnell
student since Hallie Flanagan
who has made so substantial a
contribution to the creative field?
Can you think of any alumni who
have been judged best in the ﬁeld
by a national jury, other than Mr.
Hancock?

Taste is yet another matter, i
feel that in this case your taste
was very gross: don’t you supr
pose lhal printng that editorial
somewhat dampened the
homecoming7

The last two paragraphs do not
pertain to the clause in your
contract about ”accepted
Journalistic practice." The first
three (10' facts can be obtained
by a lhreevmlnute telephone call
do not seem to be beyond the
capacity oi either oi you or even
oi your reporters. Do you really
suppose that the freedom to state
opinion given you by the editorial
page includes a ircedom to
misrepresent easxly ascor-
talnable fact?

Charles F. Cleaver-
EDl’l‘ORS NOTE

Dean Wall, recalling his report
lo [he faculty, stated that, though
he had said only’ “some in-
ici-cslcd students" brought the
proposal lo him, he did tell the
incuiiy that Hancock was coming
lo oi-nmeii lo help commemorate
Black Martyrs' Day. A number
of lacully members have told the
5&1; lhal they received the line
presslml ii-om Wall's un-
noimcemenl that the “interested
students" were members of CBS,

Nona as H turns out, CBS did

not initiate the proposal and
Dean Wall was mistaken cone
cerning Hancock's purpose in
visiling Grinnell.

The crucial point was not so
much what was really the case
as what the faculty believed to
betlie case.

Technically, the facts were, in
part, as you stated them. We
sland firm in our criticsm of the
facult)‘simprudentactions,

the book's censorship. Leggett
insirucicd the Committee to

tllel‘more, while the manuscript
may have been delivered to the
College lawyer in an unopened

Sitting in an open box in the closet

did not willingly “hand the

refused, I then told him that we
were prepared to take the matter
of the manuscripts ownership to

comply with our request. It was
only after an emotional meeting
wilh Leggetl and Ben Graham,
during which Graham iniormed
me lhal “Wilhelm, you ought to
grow up," that Leggett gave in
and returned the manuscript.

The notion that the book

The History of Henry Wilhelm and Krystyna
Neuman at Grinnell College

By MARK SABLEMAN
Pan Two

If Henry Wilhelm were any
other former Grinnell student,
he would have left Grinnell
after the yearbook problem
was finally settled. The whole
controversy about the 1966
yearbook would have been
gradually erased from the
minds of the people at Grins
nell, and no one would really
remember Henry Wilhelm for
very long. But Henry Wilhelm
was not just any other former
student. His father, who had
been a Political Science pro-
lessor here more than fifteen
years ago, still owned a house
in Grinnell, and Henry had
moved into 1408 East Street in
the summer of 1966.

Furthermore, he had no der
sire to leave Grinnell: Krystyna
Neuman and most of me rest
of his friends were here, and
he knew this community as
well as any other. He was born
in Grinnell, and spent his
early childhood here during the
days his father was on the fac-
ulty. He attended kindergarten
and first grade at Cooper
School, across from Quad. (He
remembers it as ”repressive,"
but recalls no controversy over
freedom of expression, the is-
‘sue that has plagued him so
much recently.

Thus, when Henry Wilhelm
and Krystyna Neuman picketed
the 1967 commencement in pro-
test of the "censorship" of
Wilhelm’s yearbook, two of the
men who were there and saw
them — Glenn Leggett, Presi—
dent of the College; and Bill
Peters, Grinnell Chief of P0»
lice — knew that it was not the
last they would see of Henry
Wilhelm and Krystyna Neu-
man. Those men — and, more
importantly, the institutions or
groups they represented: Grina
nell College and the town of
Grinnell — would have to con-
tend with Henry Wilhelm and
Krystyna Neuman even after
they were no longer students
at Grinnell College.

Perhaps the one most con-
troversial issue that has come
up repeatedly since the year
book is the publication of the
underground newspaper Ptero-
dactyl, and the involvement of
Henry Wilhelm, Krystyna Neu»
man, and others at the East
Street Gallery with it, Ptero-
dactyl was begun in the fall

term of 1967 by a group of col- ’

lege students, and during most

of 1968 it was edited by Rich-

ard Schneirov, then a Grinnell

one of the issues in late 1968,
while Schneirov was studying
for ﬁnals, but outside of that
he was not involved with
New until 1969, after Schneir-
ov was no longer at Grinnell.

During 1969 four issues of
Pterodzctyl were published,
and Henry Wilhelm and Krys-
tyna Neuman, as well as oth-
ers who lived at East Street,
including Larry Frank and Kit
Lederer, worked on them. In
each of these issues, Wilhelm's
philosophy of allowing anyone
to publish anything that he
wanted was followed. Under
this system, one staff member
could have something printed
in the paper even if the other
staff members disagreed with
it. Only this, Wilhelm felt.
could be true freedom of ex
pression, In fact, he said, many
of the things which did appear
in Pterodactyl under this free-
dom of expression" rule were
things that he personally did
disagree with.

Such a newspaper with “com-
plete freedom of expression"
may have been the ideal for
Wilhelm; others did not see it
that way. Iowa Attorney Gen-

eral Richard Turner, who had
been bothered by what he con-
sidered obscene content in
earlier Pteros, arranged to
have the March 13, 1969 issue
seized when Wilhelm and
Larry Frank took the proof
pages to the printer at Wilton
Junction, Iowa. Immediately
after the seizure, which they
thought was illegal, Wilhelm
and Frank filed suit against
Turner in U.S district court in
Des Moines. They asked for
return of their pictures and
copy and $1,000 compensatory
and 310.000 punative damages.
The judge allowed their first
motion, for return of the paper,
but disallowed the damages on
the grounds that Turner had
judicial immunity. The second
half of the decision is current-
ly on appeal to the federal cirs
cuit court of appeals in St.
Louis, and it is being handled
by the lowa Civil Liberties
Union,

nature of an underground news-
paper to be "to create and re

The members of the Seminar will
devote themselves to a study of
historical and literary materials
relating to the English ex-
ploration and colonization of
North America and the impact
oi this enterprise upon English
satiety aiid culture. Materials
will be drawn from both English
and American sources, and they
expect to make extensive use at
the library‘s Ayer Collection
«90,000 original and secondary
sources on the colonization of the
Americas), the unique holdings
of the recently established
Nawberry Library Center for the
Study of Historical Cartography,
the inclusive collection of “Early

With these and other materials
tiiiclnding records, slides, and
the holding or Chicago’s Art

to consider such matters as the
lac-tors (economic, intellectual,
political, religious, and social)
which gave impetus and direction
to the expansion or England
overseas; the patterns or
colonization and society which
developed; the extent to which
the expectations of those who
came to the New World were

Theater Presentation

Hy Nada Mungialclli

II' a drama is derived either
ii-om the author's imagination or
irom actual, real events, then the
hlack theater presentation
directed by actor-inrresidence
Errol Jones contained no drama,
11 acting is the trained evocation
ill emotions and actions of lic-
lional character, then the
presentation also contained no
acting in other words, this was
not theater.

lt is, thereiore, inappropriate
to criticize the presentation as
theater. What is important and
adm able is that this non-
tlicatrical presentation strongly
held the audience‘s attention and
got them thinking. The material,
writings oi great black leaders,
was not fictional but instead very
real. The presentation or these
readings was also real. because
the actors were not pretending
to be someone else involved in
a hypothetical situation, feeling
hypothetical emotions. They
were in tlte situation and actually
did feel the emotions. They got
Ilieirmessage across.

Henry Wiemun, Famous American Theologian
Now Living in Grinnell, Interviewed by S& B

By Slow Grow

One ol Grinnell's distinguished
residents is Henry Nelson
Wiemaii, a WellvkliDWn 20th
century American theologian.
Mr. Wieman taught at the
University or Chicago until his
retirement twenty years ago.
Since then he has
taught ten years at the
University of Southern Illinois,
several at the University of
Oregon, and at the University of
llouston, and for one year at
Grinnell College, Grinneli
College awarded him an
honorary degree in 1964, Mr.
Wieman is the author of several
books on the philosophy of
religion including Man’s
Ulliinnlc Commitment and The
Source of Human Good. His books
deal with the problem of defining
a new faith which is adaptable
to modern industrial civilization.
Martin Luther King wrote his
doctoral dissertation on the
works of Mr. Wiernan and those
of Paul Tillich. In an interview
with the 8&5, Mr. Wleman
discussed his views On religion
and on certain problems in
modern society.

Wieman noted that traditional
religions which look ,to another
hie and rely on a personal god
are declining in iniluence, largely
because ”there is no adequate
evidence” that such a god exists.
church attendance may continue’
but these religions do not el-
fectively influence the decisions
shaping the course of our
civilization. Mr, Wieman ad-
vocates a religious philosophy of
“Creative Interchange." “This is
a creativity always present in
human lite to some degree and
at some level, it is the way every
new born infant acquires a
human mind. It Creates and
sustains human existence and, to
the degree this creativity
prevails over counter processes.
transforms human life toward
the fullest content of value ever
to be attained. The problem is
to give this creativity tirst
priority in times or major
decision by always seeking that

“This creativity is a kind of

Religion Discussion Plagued
By Failure in Definition

ByJaiietsinith

The Board of Religion this
week brought to the campus
tliree seminarians, holding
radically different theological
views, Sunday, April 5 the topic
of discussion was “theology and
the Community". Allan
Wallerstadt, the moderator,
valiently attempted to suggest
the necessity for a working
definition of community. The
issue was never resolved and
plagued the sessions (attended
by less than 30 students) both
evenings

Each participant presented a
short talk on their personal
religious views and relations to
their community. James Moore
of Trinity Evangelical Divinity
School, Deeriield, lliinois, sup-
ported the “classical protestant
orthodoxy, preached in the 19th
century evangelical revivals”,
feeling confident that his con-
viction spoke for his school, a
tight-knit community. He was
especially concerned about the
alienation of today‘s youth and
saw a need for a new faith, the
faith “[0qu by Luther." He
maintained “For modern man
attempting to remake himself
and his world, the Christian
answer holds great promise:
when you cannot overcome your
condition, God can."

Ted Means of United-Tiler
ologicai Seminary of the Twin
Cities stressed the diversity of
views held at United and 8m-
phasized the tenacity of his own
position. Presently, he was
questioning the G. o. F. values
he grew up with and reinforced
by his near “monastic” un-
dergraduate years at Cornell
College, He does not accept the
divmity of Christ but considered

him a model after which to
pattern his life, a statement'

which caused several to question
his “Christianity,"

Monday evening the program
was entitled ”Theology and
College”, All in some way ad—
vocated structural changes
within the university and saw
major faults in .the Grinnell
community. Jim suggested the
college provide students with
“defined local centers of learning
among which they must choose
and arrange their experiences”.
These would be “nan-fraternities
and neo-sororities 7 each having
its guiding philosophy, its
curriculum, and its student7
faculty steering committee." Ted
delineated the characteristics of
a community, emphasizing ops
enness and trust and formulation
of decisions by the community
as a whole. Grinnell is not a come
munity in that itis a hierarchical
structure, and doesn’t allow
adequate individual freedom.

Stephen Mallingcr of Hebrew
Union Collegertlewish institute of
Religionﬂincinnatl, Ohio, defined
his community as that of all

LEO’S
STANDARD

CAR STARTS

LUBRICATION

Jews, stressing the impossibility
of losing one's Jewishness. “Once
a Jew, always a Jew", if only
hy Virtue of circumcision. He‘
acknowledged that it is a little
more difficult to join the Jewish
community, for a convert must
be accepted by the entire com-
munity. '

Well, the theologians got down
off their pedestal and the
discussion rapidly degenerated
into a bull session. Personal
gripes and dissatisfactions about
the educational processes and
Grinnell community were aired,
The words God and' theology
disappeared for the rest of the
evening.

The program’s purposes may
have been accomplished by
exposing the seminarians to
Grinnell College and the Grin-
iiellians to students with a
theological background, through
individual meetings, Theology,
however. was not examined
during the panels. One par-
ticipant evaluated the panels as
"abortions, theologically
speaking." I am inclined to
agree.

And Leggett's idea that . .the
committee’s offer to Wilhelm did
not involve censorship since the
committee was publisher, and a
“publisher cannot censor his own
material" is a typical of
Leggett's doublertalk northink
attitude toward students and
young people in general.

Back when
censored, I tried to deal with the
situation with reason and an
appeal to legal andethical notions
of what is right That all failed
if the same situation occurred
now, lwould probably use other
methods of dealing with it. Like
many young people in Amerika,
I’m getting pretty mad. Like
Johnny Cash‘s song about “What
is Right," the Judge looked down
at the long-haired youth and
didn't hear a word he said. We’ve
had enough of this crap.

To the editors of the Scarlet and

Regardless of the merits of
giving Herbie Hancock an

He did himself express an inn

Second, The Concerned Black

anyone that Mr, Hancock receive

DcarSlr:

Your last issue’s editorial on
Milovan Djilas aborted visit here
was surely one of your silliest
emotional outbursts, unless, of
course, it was a cynical attempt
to influence logically and
politically underdeveloped
younger students with specious
politicalargument.

The demand that liberals and
radical leftists balance (and
weaken) their criticisms of
American society and foreign
policy with devotion of equal time
to ritualistic denunciation of
Communist governments abroad
is 'a hoary old reactionary
campaign tactic. How many
reactionaries devote equal time
to denouncing rightist military
coups abroad, genocide in In-
donesia, racism in South Africa
and Rhodesia, and the much
worse and more consistent
violations oihuman rights among
our policerstate allies in general?

The typical reactionary cons
ccpt oi civics seems to he that
people should be more concerned
with tyranny in Siberia, sup-
pression of religion in Mongolia,
or frightening quotations (often
piionyt from Lenin or Mao than
with problems of American
foreign or domestic policy that
our right to vote (hopefully at
eighteen) and payment of taxes
should logically make more vital
tous.

Tuesday Night allhe Movies:
The 'Old Senaie' Bows Out

By TOM GREENFIELD

I took on this column originally
because i have nothing to do on
Tuesday nigiits. However, this
past week presented me with a
crisis This week's meeting 7 the
last meeting of the old Senate
7 fell on the same night as the
academy award presentations

It just wouldn'tseem like April
if i didn‘t turn on a tube and
hear John Wayne say “I’m John
Wayne. I work with my clothes
on.“ Dismayed at the possibility
of missing one of my top favorite
spring rituals, i searched the
campus for a solution.

My dilemma was finally solved
by “Big Bertha," Bob
Euygenliausen’s 24 ounce, 2 inch
transistorized television set.

i marched into the Senate
meeting with Bertha at my side.
Setting myself up behind the
Senate table, 1 cast one eye to
the Senate and one eye to the
stars. My report of the evenings’
observations follows,

9:30. Phil Mears, a spokesman
for the student power steering
committee, moves ,to open up a
general assembly of all present

10:45, Problems arise as

technical points. Mr. Gregory

the faculty philosophy. John

”:00, Students are having
trouble understanding much of
the vague wording in the Steering

‘muny semantic questions of their

the rest of 1969. The third issue
of the year came out Septemr
ber 18, 1969, and it did not gen
erate any oi the controversy
that the previous issue had, or
the next would. The publication
at the final issue of Pterodactyl
on November 11, 1969 resulted
In more legal action. Four
people who were selling Ptero<
dactyl in Cedar Falls, Iowa e
Krystyna Neuman, Kit Leder,
Jacob Margolan (then a Grin-
nell student). and a friend of
Margolan‘s from another colr
lege — were arrested under an
Iowa obscenity law which
makes it a felony to sell mate-
rial that is deemed obscene,

Those four people were are
i'aigned at that time in county
district court in Waterloo, Earr
lier this year it was thought
that the charges might be
dropped; however, a second ar-
raignment was held on March
30, and a trial date was set for
Krystyna Neul-nan and Kit
Leder for May 31, l970, and
for Margolan and the other de-
fendant at a later date. Krys-
tyna Neuman and Kit Leder
are apparently being singled
out for an earlier trial,‘ but it
is not known why.

In February of this year,
Henry Wilhelm, Krystyna Neu»
man, and other East Street Gale
lery residents announced that
they were leaving Pterodactyl
for the present because other
staff members a they men-
tioned Bruce Nissen and Sally
Hamann — had imposed major-
ity rule, as opposed to the
”freedom of expression" prin-
ciple, as the rule for determin
ing what material should go
into Ptem. Wilhelm, Krystyna
Neuman and the others cons
cluded their statement with the
words “We will return Irom our
exile."

Shortly alter the Playboy
demonstration of F e b r u a r y,
1969. two students, Neil Fis-
cher and Gregg Schmidt, wrote
an editorial and read it over
KDIC radio which implied that
the demonstration was staged
by Wilhelm, with the idea that
he would be able to profit from
the sale of photographs of it.
After this editorial was broad-
cast, Mrs. Ruth Prescott of the
College at Information Servict
obtained the text of it and hac
copies made, which she sent to
the area news media under a
cover letter explaining, “We

offer It simply Ior your inforr
motion,”

On August 28, 1969, Wilhelm
Iiled a libel suit in Poweshiek
County District Court in Monte-
zuma alleging that because oi
distribution of that letter and
editorial, he was “exposed to
public hatred, contempt, and
ridicule" and suffered “irrep-
arable damage to l’IIS reputation
as a photographer," He named
Mrs. Prescott, President beg-
gett, Dean wall, Chairman oi
the Board of Trustees Robert
Noyce, Vice Chairman Ellen
Pray Maytag, and Treasurer
and Business Manager Donald
W, Lambic as defendants, and
asked for $20,000 general and
315,000 special damages. Late
last year, Wilhelm withdrew
the suit because of financial
problems in retaining legal
counsel; however, he intends to
rctile it as soon as he is able.

In November or last year
Wilhelm was charged with Vio-
lation of a Grinnell zoning ore
dinance which prohibited busi-
nesses in residentially zoned
areas, such as the section of
East Street where he lives. He
was tried and found guilty of
the charge in the court of Grin
nell Justice of the Peace Ed-
win Lincoln.

In that trial, the stais’s eVl
dence consisted of testimony by
Chief of Police Bill Peters and
Grinnell photographer Charles
Sumner, who had bought a photo
washer from Wilhelm, and a
picture of Wilhelm’s house
showing a sign with the words
“East Street Gallery” (having
a sign of a certain size or
larger constitutes a violation ol
the zoning ordinance). The (Ice
tense was represented by Law
hence Frank, who contended that
Wilhelm was not in violation ol
the sense of the zoning ordi-
nance, since none of his neigh-
bors were bothered, Frank said
in his closing statement
which Judge Lincoln later
called “a gem” — that the
charge ol violation of the zen
ing law constituted “a ludir
crous attempt on the part oi
citizens to harass Henry wn-
helm‘.”

Nevertheless, Wilhelm was
[ound guilty on the basis ol the
evidence, and he was fined $25.
Wilhelm intended to appeal the
case to district court in Monte:

Your Favorite

Snack Items

zuma. but was unable to raise
the $200 necessary for an ap-
peal bond; therefore, he chose
to pay the penalty by going to
i ' where each day counts as
$3.33 towards the line. There
are those who think that
complaint against Wilhelm on
the basis ol the zoning law cons
stituted harassment by citi
zens 7 is possibly yustiiied.
Several people who are ac
quainted with the case indicated
to the 5&3 that pressure was
put on the Grinnell city council
to take action against Wilhelm
by citizens associated with a
beauty shop operator who had
been found guilty of the same
zoning 0 rd in a n c e several
months before Wilhelm’s case.
Furthermore. two sources, one
which is extremely reliable, ins
dicated that originally pressure
was put on the council to
charge the beauty shop operator
With violation of the ordinance
by one or more college protes-
sors who lived near the beauty
shop. It is, however, impossible
to ascertain with any degree oi
certainty what pressures, ii
any, were involved in the brings
ing of the charge against Wile
helm.

Last fall, after Freda Tepiel,
a former Grinnell student who
lived at the East Street Gallery,
was fired by the owner or a
cafe south of town, she and
Krystyna Neuman went to tall
to her former employer, Mr.
Gene McCurry. While McCurry
and Freda Tepier were talking,
Krystyna Neuman attempted to
take their picture. When he saw
this, according to Krystyna Neu~
man, McCurry went towards her
and he and an assistant grabbed
her camera. Subsequently. shs
filed a complaint against Mc»
Curry asking that he be charged
with assault and battery. Mce
Curry pied not guilty, and a
trial was held in Judge Line
coln's court.

After the first two witnesses
were called, however, Krystyna
Neuman withdrew her com-
plaint because she felt that the
county attorney, Michael Enich,
was not objecting to questions
from McCurry's attorney which
were irrelevant to the case r

“lazy” and claiming that they

"don’t want to work.”
Peek said that a major reason

whites continue to dominate
blacks is that “blacks in high
positions had to prove themv
selves 'niggers' to get those
jobs.” He cited Senator Brooks
of Massachusetts as a nex-
ample. “Senator Brooke‘s cons
stituency is white and his fi-
nancial support is white. If he
goes against his support to
represent the black commtb
nity, he is doomed.”

“Integration of restrooms,
lunch counters, and other facil-
ities was a waste of energy be-
cause it didn't challenge the
social and political power struc-
ture. Integration is a smoke
screen.

”Race is the first thing which
Is determined; it cannot be
changed. Blacks have decided
to be black and to work from
there to assault the power
structure, It you are pro-black,
you don't have enough time to
spend on feelings like racism."

Sunday morning, the Rover
and Joseph H. Williams, guest
speaker, presented a sermon
on "Empty Seats ~ Missing
Brothers.” The Chicago Gos-
pel Ensemble provided music.

The Rev. Williams addressed
himself first to the black mar-
tyrs: ”A martyr is one who
would die rather than set aside
his convictions.” He presented
a long list of black martyrs of
all skin colors. asserting that
“blackness is not a matter of

skin color,
soul."

”The black community ought
to be concerned with black
martyrs because we are the
martyrs. Anyone who stands up
for humanizing people in this
society becomes a martyr.
When Martin Luther King, Jr.
started talking about power for
poor people, about ending the
war in Vietnam, he had to go."

"Racism is a sickness that
pervades America today. There
will be no liberation of black
folks until the middle~class
white folks are liberated. To
them, things are more impore
tant than people:"

Then the Rev. Williams dis-
cussed his maln point -— the
role black people should take
in their liberation movement:
“I'm tired of the statement
‘l'm ready to die.‘ There's too
much to be done. Those people
in the graveyard are no threat
to anyone. If you die while
working to help the commu-
nity, that’s different — you
don't have any control over
that."

The Rev. Williams directed
his conclusion to the black
members of the congregation.
“People don't have to worry
about two kinds of people —
those with no tools and those
who won’t use them. If you
don‘t go back to your commu-
nities and do more than you
could have without your edu-
cation, then you’re wasting
your time.”

practicable alternatives in that
situation."

It should be the task of
government and of all men to
prOVlde conditions most
favorable for Creative In»
terchange. “It we cannot solve
the problem oi enabling men to
live together with the power oi
modern technology in a world oi
diverse cultures, we shall an-
Iiihilatethehuman race."

Does Mr, Wieman see any signs
that Creative interchange is
developing? “There are several
hopetul signs, but we can have
no assurance that these will lead
to more Creative Interchange.”
Wieman cited increased concern-
for the poor, the growing ten»
dency of nations to refrain from
war (largely because of the big
nations' recognition of each
other": power), increasing
recognition of the need {or
economic, political, and other
interchange with the Communist
world, growing discussion be
tween blacks and whites over
recognition of the status of Negro
Americans, and the recognition
that students should participate
more in the process of their
education. These signs indicate
to Wieman that “either we are
doomed or headed for something
better than the past." They are

neither all bad nor all good, “but
they hold the potentiality for both
good and bad results.” The mere
recognition of such problems and
diiicrcnces is a step in the right
direction, according to Wieman.

What can the United States do
now to help create a good at»
mosphere for Creative In-
terchange’! “First, we Should get
out of Vietnam. All we are
gaining by our involvement there
is a talse notion of prestige;
we could Withdraw much more
quickly than we are." Another
step would be to open com-
munication with Communist
Cuba. Wieman believes that the
present policy is only driving
Cuba closer to the Communist
black. “There is an insane hate
and [ear or Communism. Surely
it is a bad system, but the only
way to correct it is to open
Communication." Internally the
United States has done a fairly
good job in Wieman‘s opinion.
“For one thing we are
recognizing the need to educate
all men, I don’t think integration
is going to solve the problem oi
educating Negro Americans.
Blacks would like to join the
society as equals, not as his
feriors, so the first task should
be to improve their school
systems.”

“The United States needs to
recognize that its problem is not
to produce wealth, but to develop
the mentality, the sociality, and

the creative energy which will
promote Creative Interchange,"
wieman noted that many ex-
periments are now going on in
American Education One of the
great problems is how to educate
those Students With low IQ'S. Mr.
Wieman believes they can be
taught, but just what and how
he is not sure. “Education should
quicken a student‘s mind so that
he can think [or himself and
develop as an individual."

What is Wieman‘s opinion of
the current student power
movement? “Students should he
encouraged to express their
views to the faculty, but I think
they should not dictate the course
of their education.” Mr, Wieman
believes that the reason for all
the turmoil on collcge campuses
today is that the old traditions
and habits necessary tor
governance of a college have
been to some extent left behind,
but that new traditions and habits
necessary lor governance of a
college with more student par-
tlcipation have not yet developed.
When such traditions develop
Wieman expects more
tranquility,

wiemaii reierred ti-eouently to
a transitional state, which he
believes American Society is
experiencing, This is generally
characterized by a decrease in
respect for a man‘s status, In his
opinion this could lead to a better
situation it, in place of such re-
spect, more respect for per-
sonality were developd. “Of
course in order for a society to
continue there will always need
to be some recognition and
respectioraman’sstatus.“

“Many in our time turn from
God to the universe as the major
concern of religion. There is a
tragic error. The universe as
known to the human mind is a
transitory vision. A thousand
years ago it was very different
trom what it is today. A thousand
years irom now it still be very
different from what it is today

The universe ls known to the
human mind as being con-
tinuously created by expanding
the range of data and creating
morc comprehensive theories.
Thus a knowable universe
emerges from out of the fullness
of being. This iniinite fullness of
being is an unfathomable
mystery forever beyond our
understanding. To call it God is
to claim to know something about
what is unknowahle, But
religious commitment to
Creative Interchange will expand
to the utmost what we can know,
can value, can control and will
resolve the conﬂicts that threaten
our existence."

ML Wieman has not written
any books for two or three years
although he has often been asked,
He cites time as the culprit and
leels he no longer has the
necessary energy. In the future
he intends to relax, think, and

The trouble must have started

Mr Wrigley hasn't played the

out in center field don't seem to
know that. They would seem to
belong to a diilerent baseball
mentality that's completely lost

O-C Take I.M. Openers

ByJ. c. Labowitz

The 123rd llu'soitball season opened on Monday, and trom all
indications this season should be the highest point in soltball history
since J,B. Grinncll invented the game to see how far west he had

come,

Be that as it may, the season openers saw Cleveland take Loose
6rd, and Dibble shutout Haines 370, despite Dave Brown’s 15 strikeouts
for Homes, which must Set some kind of record. Dave MacKenzie
wasn't that good tor Cleveland, but he had some hitting, which is
somewhat essential. Great consternation was {git in IM circles (or
diamonds) about the dominance of pitching 7 only 13 runs in 2 games!

Such worries were dispelled and IMS returned to form by
Tuesday, as Cowles beat East by something like 28-8, and Read and
Oli~Campils bad a pitcher's duel that ended 23725, Read. Go had

some players irom very tar

off-campus, like Park Elementary,

and Read needed a home run from an outfielder named Labowitz
to win. West Norris is not competing in softball, and the franchise
is being moved to the Faculty. Steve Johnson is arranging the Faculty
players and schedule, since profs are not supposed to cut classes
for [M games. But then again, neither are students.

Grinnell’s track team made an inauspicious start drop-
ping the first meet of the season to Loras.

Grinnell took two events in the quad meet. Norris
Stubbs (above) took the triple jump with a 45-0 pedom-
ance, And Bill Schooler took the javelin with a loss of 151-10.

does work that 7 and it

not the way it’s worked, let’s say

And there was a terrific amount

stats: Do you think that the
game is as interesting, still"

\HIL: The game is iii-
trinsically unchanged, except
iiisoiai- as it‘s been corrupted by
those who have tried to make
something else out oi it, and who
are gradually succeeding The
game is intrinsically the same
They haven't even changed the
rules in any important way,
which is a good thing.

Although. .they have
monkeyed around with the game
a great deal. They've monkeyed
with the ball, they've monkeyed
with the iences, they've
monkeyed with the height of the
pitching mound, and they’re

.doing their best to make as much

of a television Show out of it as
they can. . .And this is part oi
the corruption.

They haven't succeeded, quite,
in leasing up the whole thing up
7 but they're working on it. And
it started a long time ago with
an exploitation oi what was not
essential in the game. At the
same time that Ruth was hitting

making double plays, but nobody
