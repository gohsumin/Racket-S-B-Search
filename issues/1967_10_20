LEGGETT 0N
GONVOOATION

President Leggett, addressing
the Senate informally, expressed
his support for a human values
course. “It's a marvelous idea,"
he said, noting, however, that
it will probably take a long
push to obtain {acuity approval.

Leggett feels that the ieculty
may balk at substituting it for
existing r e (1 u l r a d ireshman
courses or adding human val-
lies to the present course load.
He also noted that introduction
oi such a course may neces‘
sitate hiring faculty members
who specialiu in ethics,

Leggett also briefly discussed
administration rationale regard-
ing Homecoming - Convocation.
Affirming the indirect financial
motivations for the Convoca-
tion. he said. “What is at issue
is the future of colleges like
this i’m trying to broaden the
basis oi support. l'm trying to
ghow oil the college to them
(potential contributors)."

Small liberal arts colleges
Iuch as Grinnell, Leggett ex-
plained, face increasing com.
petition from major state uni-
versities that now combine both
guallty and quantity.

The upcoming Convocation
Is without precedent, "There
are all kinds or things we can
he to make a splash," Leggett
said. “Mr, Stauss, Mr, Wall.
and i decided to do it on the
basis oi massive qualityi"

Answering a suggestion that
it is easy to attract big names
It enough money and honorary
degrees are preferred. he ex-
plained that the dignitaries are
not getting paid much more
than their travel and living
expenses.

“As for degrees," he added,
“obtaining them is no problem
for people like Martin Luther
King, Ashley M o n t a gu. and
Marshall McLuhan,"

He estimated overall expense

College Treasurer Donald
Lambio and Director of Devel‘
opment James Avison told the
Side they could not pinpoint
the definite source oi money
used to ﬁnance Convocation,
but noted that expenses will
necessitate an increase in giits
to balance the budget

“The Convocation will be ii<
nanced largely out oi gifts,”
Lamble said.

Avison, however, had previ«
ously noted that the develop-
ment budget includes funds
that may be used for Convo-
cation.

He declined to specify their
source.

Anticipated iunds for a given
iiscal year are budgeted among
the various college oiilces, Avi-
son said. “Convocation is one
oi many items on which the
budget money will be spent."

Avison was reluctant to es-
timate the total cost at

MONTAGU AND GILMAN TO PARTICIPATE

ANN-WAR RALLY PLANNED
FOR SUPER WEEKEND

By NEIL FISCHER

An anti-war rally-including
Grinneil Chairman of Faculty
Joseph Wail. Princeton Univer<
sity anthropologist Ashley Mon-
tagu, and Yale University
drama professor Richard Gil-
man as participants—has been
approved for 1 - 2 pm. Sunday,
October 29, on Barber Plaza,

Oiiicials oi the Grinnell Stil-
dant Movement (GSM) said that
the rally would "serve as a
culmination oi the GSM's pres-
ent anti-Vietnam activities on
campus"

Montagu and Giiman will ad-
dress an ekpected group at
several hundred students iol~
lowing an introduction by Wall.

Roth visiting proiessora will
sign a GSM anti-war petition.
The petition began circulating
Tuesday among the Grinnell
community.

Gilman wrote to Deslonde
Lamb—a worker on the GSM'S
Vietnam Committee—Tuesday
stating that he would “be happy
to make a . . . speech."

Montagu had previously writ‘
ten the GSM that he would
participate providing President
Leggett considered the move
“proper" during his visit here
during Convocation.

Leggett last Thursday told
Ron Millar—B Vietnam Com«
mittee representative—that “. .
. .what Mr. Montagu does with
his time is his own business,"
“He's his own man,” Leggett
said.

The Vietnam Committee pe-
tition states that the present

war is “immoral and a uso< '

less loss oi lives.”

It further lists three points
agreed to by all who sign:
that bombing oi Vietnam—North
ﬁnd South—should cease; that
the 1L 5. should declare a uni-
lateral cease-lire; and that the
Ui S. should recognize that the
National Liberation Front has
significant support in the South
and should be allowed to no-
gotiate.

Copies oi the signed petition
will be mailed to President
Johnson. Secretary Rusk. Sec-
retary McNamara, S e n a to r
Fullbright, Senator Robert Ken-
nedy, and several other sena-
tors and representatives on the
Armed Services committees.

Miller said that possible pr
ldential candidates (Romney.
Rockefeller, Nixon. Percy, etc,)
would also be sent copies.

TOWN AND COLLEGE

Relations between the young people of Grinnell and the stu-
dents 0t Grinnell College are at a very low point. The hostility
can be traced back to the objectionable behavmr of a few persons
on each side: "townles" who steal from college rooms and lounges
and vandalize college property, and “college queers” whose ac-
tions downtown are repulsive to the sensibilities of local residents.

Fear on each side that the respective ways of life are in
danger, and the subsequent rumors and exaggerations, have led
to hostility toward all members of the opposite group.

College students have two responsibilities: we must be tolerant
of the “tomles” and we must make sure they are tolerant at us.

“Townies” who steal and vandalize must be caught and turned
over to the police. “Townies” who verbally and physically abuse
Negro students must be identified, and complaints filed with the
police immediately.

Police Chief Peters is firmly dedicated to the maintainace of
law and order in Grinnell, but he is handicapped by the hesi-
tanco of students to press charges and produce witnesses. We
must be willing to lace the problem and deal with it directly.

The 5&3 urges President Leggett to work to establish a town-
college commission to examine the difficulties between college
students and young townspeople. The problem wants study; it
must be eliminated soon.

ANTI-WAR PETITION

The 5&3 urges all members of the Grinnell community to
llgn the anti-war petition being circulated by GSM. Marches and
draft card burning have their places, but the political implica-
tions of petitions circulated among college students are far reach-
lug.

The most obvious response by the Johnson Administration is
to dismiss such petitions as the work of idle college noise-makers.
The coming majority of many students and the rapidly approach-
Ing election year should, however, temper this view. A series of
luch petitions on college campuses around the country would
certainly help to push the peace question into the forefront in this
coming election year.

Let those of us who have been active in the peace movement
be the first to sign this important document. And let those of us
.who are just awakening to our responsibilities as citizens and
yeaccloving people make signing the petition our first commits
merit. Let us show President Johnson that the new voters of the
United States are opposed to his war.

NOTES FROM THE
CIRCULAR FILE

Four of the convocation guests will be staying in the mens‘
residence halls. But where in the hall? Dean Thompson told the
Resident Advisers that the guests would stay in the house presi-
dents’ suites; he told the house presidents that the guests would
be staying in the R. [Ls’ suites. He told the 5&3 he wasn't sure
where they were staying.

LETTERS TO
THE EDITOR

lllllliillllllillllliillllllillllllillllllillllllllHillilllllillllllllll
To the Editor:

Due to some of the response
to the letters posted around
campus announcing a “drug
discussion and aid service” be
ing implemented, we would like
to clarify a few points:

1. The major project to he
carried out is a regular semi-
nar to be held at Eli-Loco, Sev-
eral students are working to-
gether to plan it, and the lirst
meeting is tentatively sched-
uled for Wednesday, November
I.
2. The “old" service, if he-
gun, can be no more than an
information service. No Haight~
Ashbury “main switchboard" is
being planned, and there is no
Intention of playing with il~
legality. Nevertheless, as dnlg
use spreads, people may want
advice. No such service now
exists, and if anyone has sug-
gestions or advice. put a note
in Box 513.

3. Perhap most importantil
the seminar will not be pro-
moting drugs. Hopefully, it will
air opinions and facts. Pot and
most hallucinogenics are illegal,
and that is a fact that no one
should forget. But, they exist,
and need to be examined, be-
cause they are so widespread
and reﬂect the society in which
they are used. The seminar is
not being addressed to the
“head" on campus, but to
everybody.

We hope this letter clears up
n iew oi the fears and ob-
jections that have been ex-
pressed.

I usually dislike the aroma
or newlymimeugraphed docu-
ments, but when I opened my
copy of the Haveman report
Wednesday night I genuinely
hoped for something.

What I hoped for—roughly
imagined and paraphrased—-
was just a paragraph some
thing like this:

“The Special Commltlee on
Educational Policy and Curri-
culum recommends that every
Grinnell student have the op
tion of taking a semester of
oft-campus work. Such students
would be placed in jobs in
large cities by the college of-
ﬁce of placement.”

What I hoped for, alas, was
Antioch. l . or maybe Beloit.
. . ,but never, I guess, Grinnell.

The paragraph wasn’t there,
but a little autobiography, 1
think, is necessary here.

Last week I took a little
mindrsobering sojourn to Boston
for six days. I didn't go to visit
there: I went to live there.

And I lived with some people
from Beloit engaged, as it
were, in just the kind of pro-
gram 1 want to talk about
(or talk around.)

They—excuse me, we—shared
an apartment. It’s really a very
fun thing to decorate an apart-
ment and live and cook for
yourself.

They went to work at typi-
cally workaday jobs — at the
Harvard Co-op or insurance
companies—every morning.

And i went to work every
morning. . . iollowing them.

I’m not sure What it is I
want to tell you, because ac-
tually the column this week is
nothing more than one lengthy
sigh.

But they were learning how
to live away from Grinnell and
—for six days—so was i.

“A really liberal education,”
Tom Greenfield mused to me
the other day, “has really got
to include getting out of Grin-
nell, Iowa now and again.”

The point really hit home,
because all the rive-hour bus

ERROOOR

I found myself thinking the
most incredible and untoward
or thoughts. . . for me.

“Zowie,” I thought, “it will
really be good to get back
or home or whatrtbe-hell-ever
to Gﬁnnell."

Then I recanted: “What are
you doing, you nincompoop?
Aren’t you the one always
stumbling across campus mums
bling how much you hate the
place?”

“Self," I said to myself, “Stop
this immediatelyl"

But I couldn’t, because it
really was good to be going
. . . back.

Why? Because I thought I
was bringing something back?

Yes?

Why can't we get away from
Grinnell to bring something
back other than what We are
at home or at Grimell?

We have our Argonne Semes
ter and Newberry Library but
why can’t we all get away
from Grinnell more often?

Can’t we? Just because we
aren’t Antioch?

And can’t we learn what it’s
like to liveiindependently and
inconspicuously—in a pla cs
where there aren’t convenient
forums and scheduled social
events and trees and other in.

Let’s have a bus-trip to Chl-
cago every other weekend, It
would only cost ten bucks if
we tilled a charter bus.

And you all know we would
fill it.

Dear readers and enemies I
wanted to wrim a single un-
disturbed unpretentious column.

This is the closest I want
to come, and I don’t care it
you like it or not.

I liked Grinneli for one whole
day after that trip.

I believe this, and maybe if
I strip away some of the tacky
phrasings and esoteric journa-
lese for a week, you’ll under.
stand that I am not~always~
a professional cynic.

This week it is my problem.

Could we do something about

A 9th FSR SIQK SENSE?

By DON WINNEY

After awkwardly groping in
my last two articles for some
kind of grand catharsis of pity
and nausea. I thought in this
third and final article of the
Dr. Kildare trilogy I would ap-
peal to the intellectual that
lurks in all of us somewhere
between Hurling and the North
Lounge. I want to examine the
medical problem at Grinnell
and do What most critics abhor
doing—suggest a possible soiu~
florid

The main problem with Grin<
hell's medical help is that the
college has little or no control
over‘it. If the student is im-
fortunate enough to contract
more than a cold, he is re-
ferred by the health center to
any one of several town doc-
tors who somehow have been
apportioned a share in the stu-
dent business. That doctor may
or may not be competent but
in any event he examines the
student and then applies to the
insurance company that carries
the college health insurance and
receives from it a standard
fee. (In one case two years
ago the fee was eight dollars
for two minutes' time; the time
was insufﬁcient.)

The student receives a re-
nelpt from the insurance com-
any and the case is closed.
n other words. the town doc-
tor, always busy with his town
patients who provide the bulk
of his business and are an un-
dertandahly important part of
his income, can nevertheless
in a year’s time accrue a
healthy—is that the word?—
suppiementary income from his
student patients. And with that
side business. that fixed income
that no one will ever question,
there is always the temptation.
whether realized or not, to
slight students and spend more
time with that elastic portion

of his income—his town pa-
tients.

The doctor not only maina
tains but expands his practice.
for like most small towns.
Grinnell is a doctor‘s market.
A thriving practice is possible
if the doctor concentrates on
faithfully caring for town pa-
tients. His time is understand
ably crowded; his town patients
are important. So he can afford
to look at the transient student,
that adolescent hypochondriac
plagued with problems of love
and gradepoint, with a certain
disdain. He can expect to hear
certain common complaints from
students who wander into his
office when he is so busy. He
can learn to ignore those com-
plaints. He can learn to ask
the simple questions that ter<
minate an appointment. “Do you
have a test tomorrow?" is one.
or “Aren't you just worried
about your grades?" Or he
might ask the ultimate question
to a Student concerned with
back trouble. for example:
“Are you having emotional
problems? Perhaps you need a
psychiatrist." He can then dis<
miss the student assured of his
eight dollars or whatever and
look after his town patient
whose future business with him
is not quite as assured as the
student."

And what of the student?
Usually his illness isn't serious
enough that such medical in-
difference will cause permanent
damage A few days and one
is generally well. But in those
rare cases where damage does
occur, permanent or temporary,
how does one prove incompet-
ence? It is difficult to do so
legally; it is quite messy 1e»
gally. But more than that, it
is simply difficult to know some-
times whether the damage in-
curred could have been averted.
It is sometimes impossible to
know In cases of sudden in-
jury or illness the student has
no recourse but to place his

faith in the competence oi near-
by physicians. And if that faith
is unjustified, then What?

But. someone will ask. is it
really as bad as all that in
the town of Grinnell? Well, see
for yourself. That question and
answer, however, is really ir-
relevant. The fact is the col-
lege has little control over that
answeri it runs a competent
health service—but only that.
But how is the college going
to assure its students that they
will always have a competent
physician? Or is medicai un-
certainty a basic part of a
Grinnell liberal arts education?

One possible solution to the
pmblem is simple but—as sim-
ple solutions may be~expensive.
The college could hire its own
physician on a fulltime basis
with an ample salary. The phy-
sician would care exclusively
for all students, for the faculty
and their families, and also
supervise the present health
center. The physician would thus
be assured a large enough cli<
enteie—and the students would
always be assured competent
medical help in any emergency.
or course, there is a great dif-
ficulty in this proposal—finding
such a physician. The admin<
istration recognizes the medi-
cal problem at Grinnell and in
now considering this and other
suggestions.

Considering the problem. how-
ever, is not necessarily going
to solve it. Something must be
done. The inadequate medical
service in Grinnell has long
been acknowledged regretfully,
jokingly. by faculty and students
alike. A college that is raising
money for a PE complex can
certainly afford to do something
about its medical service. The
question is whether it has the
will to do it—to give the med-
Ical problem a lu'ghenough
prlority that it can be solved
soon. One can only hope it will
be solved before we memorial-
ize an unwelcome martyr.

A STUDENT OPINION

WHO IS THE

By ROGER BARNES
The present complaint at your
local revolutionary students is
the hypocrisy with the admit»

incompetent, quits: possibly,
but hypocritical? Never!

Here's the deal: The hypo<

physical communication be-

open dorms from noon to mid-
night.

There are two alternatives
{or the administration. It can
disapprove, in which case the
student becomes vulnerable be-
cause of the awareness created
by such a proposal. Consequent-
1y. all violations would be dealt
with harshly.

The administration, however,
can accept the proposal and
police the dorms imm midnight
to noon to apprehend violators.

Behind this com ourtsln
which isolates Grinnell from
reality, there are no llmitl
placed upon the activities oi
sl student. I must admit. how-
ever, lhat discretion. i.o., s.
crecy, is imperative.

The “loophole" was invented
by and tor the Grinnell student,
and should be utilized. Revo-
lution, in the area oi physical
communication, is just a means
or exposure, and consequent
loss DI freedom.

Another bit of student hypo.
crlsy that is evident deals with
illegal visitations. The student
complains that the administran
tion successfully overlooks ill-
legal Visitations. He demands
immediate action via changing
the rules.

In essence, the student is
complaining that the adminisn
tration is not doing its job bow
cause it rails to reprimand him
for breaking the rules. This
little gem at a complaint trans-
cends hypocrisy and merges
wlth the realm oi stupidity.

COUNCIL EXPLAINS ROLE

By CRAIG ALLIN

Inst week, Grinnell’s new
student-faculty Judicial Council
convened to talk informally
about its role. The Council is
composed of Professors Joseph
Danforth (Chemistry), Harold
Fletcher (Political Science), and
Arnold Adelberg (Mathematics)
whom the council has chosen
chairman. Sue Dostal, Larry
Frank, and Russell Heucken-
dorf represent the student body.

The faculty members were
appointed by President Leggett,
on the recommendation of the
Chairman of the Faculty, Jos-
eph Wall. The student mem-
bers were chosen by a joint
committee of the AWS Board
and the Council of House Pres-
idents after interviewing appli~
cents. Their appointments were
confirmed by the Senate.

Members of the council talked
extensively about their role in
the community and it was ap-
parent that the campus is in
for a major change in the
handling of judical cases.
Dostal stressed the structural
differences between the Judicial
Council and the old court sys-
tem. The old judicial structure,
with three student courts, the
'deans and the Faculty Com-
mittee on Student Affairs, was
characterized as fragmented and
legalistic. D o s t a 1 pointed
out that jurisdictional disputes
were common in the past in
spite of the elaborate jurisdie
tional guidelines set down in
the Student Handbook.

The Judicial Council's char-
ter gives it original jurisdiction
in all cases where jurisdiction
is not with the house councils.
it has appellate jurisdiction in
all cases. Council members em.
phasized that any member of
the campus community could
bring cases before the council
but suggested that they might
return some cases to the house
councils, where the houses have
jurisdiction.

A d e l b e r g stressed the
separation of the adjudication

typical tyrannical aspects ap-
peared the more obvious.

The country accents endemic
to Southeast England of the
Corinthian and Theban shep<
herds contrasted beautifully with
the “correct” accents of the
king.

The contrast emphasized the
difference in station between
Oedipus and the peasants, and
the differences between high
and low accents made Oedipus‘
fall the more poignant.

Dr. Amott, a prolessor at the
University of Iowa, and a na»
tive ot ipswlch, England, makes
his oWn puppets.

“In America people accept
puppetry as a media much
more readily," Arnott explained.
“in England I had to fight tra-
dltion to portray the classics.”

He said he intended his pro-
ductions to complement Grinnell
freshman Humanities courses.

Arnutt has prepared a puppet
production of Agamemmnon,
and hopes to complete produc-
tions ofthe Oreslia.

and policy making functions
which has been accomplished.
The old Faculty Committee on
Student Affairs, which now deals
exclusively with policy making,
has been remodeled and now
consists of three representa<
fives each of the faculty, ad-
ministration, and student body.
This separation allows the Ju-
dicial Council to deal with ju-
dicial matters exclusively.

It was evident that all the
council members were eager to
fulfill the highest expectations
of the creators of the new coun-
cil. There was general agree-
ment that a consistent council
policy was essential. This does
not mean however. Flet-
cher stressed, that cases will
not be judged in context, weigh-
ing all relevant tacts. “The
stress," F l e l. c h e r continued,
“must be on problem solving,‘
not on the metlng out of pun-
lshments."

While council members werc
not unaware of their differ-
ences, there was a definite sense
of unity. Fletcher suggested that
the faculty members were just
that, and were not the repre«
sentative of the administration.
To this Heuckendorf added that
it was their hope to escape stu-
dent or‘ faculty parochial inter-
ests and speak for the whole
community. it was evident that
the council member hoped to
achieve unanimity in most of
their decisions.

Several members emphasized
the positive contributions that
the court hoped to make to
c a m p u 5 life. Dostal stress
ed consistency based on under-
tanding which Fletcher point-
ed out would allow for tho
rational appraisal of the con-
sequences of certain violations
based on court decisions. The
council appears to be trying to
orient itself as much as pos-
sible toward a problem solving
approach to its work.

The council was understand-
ably silent about some crucial
specifics of rule adjudication.
it seems probable that only
preliminary discussions have
been held in this area. The fol-
lowing things, however. became
clear during the discussion.
First, the council recognizes the
seriousness of using separation
from the college as a punish-
ment, though the possibility of
its use in particularly serious
cases was not discounted. Sec-
and, the council is cognizant oi
the unsatisfactory and unfortu-
nate allocation of penalties
which occurred under the old
structures. Dostal made it
clear th at she fell, “past
cases have not been marked by
consistency in decisions or equi-
ty in punishments."

copy from his paper, the Cana-

Jack Neelin. another resident
of the apartment said he overs
heard one of the RCMP ofa
iicers say, “Make sure you got

through the newspaper’s files.
Seed said the pictures showed
the RCMP making an arrest
on the Sparks Street Mali, 1

The police did not have a

apartment and none at then!

Seed was arrested on a non-

GRIDDERS ROMP 40-20

ly JEFF SCHECKTER

The Pioneer football team
came back from a M record
and dumped the Knox siwash
40-10.

Doug Fink and Mike dchwarts
were clearly the heroes oi the
game. With the apparent de-
mise of the Hanratty—Seymour
combination, Fink and Schwarts
appear to be the new mldwest
passing sensations. Schwartl
caught seven passes and set
Grinneli record for total yards
gained by a receiver (106) and
most touchdown passes caught
in one game (A). Fink nar-
rowly missed setting a third
aerial mark in completing 10 of
17 passes for 156 yards and no
interceptions.

Saturday’s game provided
many thrilling moments for the
halt-capacity crowd. After a
scoreless first quarter. during
which Grinnell had the ball Oil
27 of 38 plays, the Pioneers
quickly showed what was to
follow. With only 1:34 gone in
the second quarter, Fink lofted
a 38 yard touchdown pass to
Schwartz. Torn Russell kicked
the extra point and Glinnell
led 7-0.

Two plays later, Grinnell had
the ball again as Bob Lillie
recovered a fumble on the Knox
21. Fink passed to Schwartz
from the five, Russell kicked
the extra point and Grinnell
led 14—0.

After Bill Wedding’s kickoff,
Knox got only to the Grinneil
41 before losing the ball on
downs. Ten plays later. Dick
Lamb carried the ball in from
the one yard line, Torn Russell
kicked his third extra point and
the Pioneers had a 21-0 lead.

Knox finally got on the score.
board with 27 seconds lelt ill
the half. After a twelve play
drive. Dave Ladner dove in the
end zone from the one foot line.
Dan Gunning kicked the extra
point and the half ended with
the Pioneers leading the Siwash
21-7.

The second half was almost
a repeat of the second quarter.

, Fink again passed to Schwartz

for e touchdown. this one going
nine yards. The two point con-
version falled and the score

stood at 21-7. Later in the third
period. Schwartz caught a in
yard toss from Fink to culmi-
note a 61 yard drive. Weddin
kicked the PAT and the thir
quarter ended with the score
Grinnell 34. Knox 1.

In the final quarter. Kent
Thomson got into the scoring
act with e {I yard touchdown
on a reverse play. The point
try failed, but with 9:39 left
in the game the Pioneers had
a 40-7 lead. Knox finally started
to play football and scored
twice; once on a quarterback
keeper by Doyle Clark and
again on a 13 yard pass from
Clark to Jim Hallock. Only one
PAT try was successful and the
game ended with Grinnoli win-
ning 40-20.

The Knox game pointed out
many of the Pioneer strengths
and weaknesses. The team dem-
onstrated that they could sus-
tain successful drives (27, 38,
so, 49, or and 49 yards) and
perform with a balanced ah
tack (288 yards rushing and
175 passing). Defense proved to
be a problem for the Pioneers
in the last minutes of each
half. All of the Knox points
occurred within six minutes oi
the end of the half. This per-
haps more than anything also
illustrates how the lack of dew]:
is hurting the Pioneer hopes.

Grinneil‘s next home game is
with Monmouth during Super
Weekend. Monmouth has a bet<
ter team than in previous years
and could easily prove to be
a very tough opponent for the
Pioneers.

THE iiiBlTZEii ,

By JOHN R“

The Standard American bidding system places rigid limita-
tions on only one opening bid, the bid of One NoTrump. Opener
must have between sixteen and eighteen high card points, and no
suit weaker than Qx or xxx. Because of the clarity of definition in
this bid, Responder can exercise several choices in his responses.

if he has no preference for play in a suit, he will bid directlg
the following NoTrump contracts:

2 NoTrump, with 8 or 9 points or 7 and a good fiva card suit.

8 No’l‘rump. with 10 to 14 points

4 NoTrump. with 15 to 16 points (if Opener has maximum

he bids 6)

6 NOTlump, with 17 or 18 points
Forcing old then a NoTrump, with two points (if Opener has
maximum he bids 7)
1 No'l‘rump, with 21 points.
If he has slam intentions he may jump directly into the 4d
Gerber Convention. 4C-Partner. how many aces? (dB-zero or three.

iii-one, ds-two.)

If he has a preference for e suit contract and has a weak or
very strong hand he may use Jacoby Transfer Bids. These are

used in order to keep the strong hand concealed.

relay principle:

They use the

2D, relay bid 0-8 points, Opener must bid 2H.

2H, relay bid same as above but Opener must bid 25.

25, relay bid same as above but Opener must bid INT; Ro-
spender signs off at 3c Dl‘ 5D.

if after Opener has bid, responder nbids;

this shows a strong

hand with invitation to slam. The precise requirements should be
decided by the partnership; for example. 14 or more points and a
strong distributional hand would be reasonable.

If responder has between B and 12 or 13

points and a good

d—card major suit(e) he will want to know if Opener has Hard
support for a game in that major. He uses then the Stayman Conn
vention by bidding 2C. This bid can be game forcing or non-furo-
ing. in conjunction with the Jacoby Transfer Bids it should be
game forcing. Opener’s bids are then:

2H or ZS, shows Hard major; bid 2H with both

2D, denial of l-card major; min. Nonmp hand

2N, denial of i-card major; max. NoTrump hand

Responder then intends to raise partner’s Zn or 25 bid to
game; otherwise he rebids his suit conveniently or raises NT in

game.

if responder has a long semisolid suit which can lose no more
than one trick and a possible outside entry. or if he has I ready-
made suit (like AKQJxx); he can show that suit by directly bid-
ding it at the three level: 3C, 3D, 3H, 35.

it he has a long topless major suit with d or 6 playing tricks
and a weak hand with no more than 10 points, he can show it by
using the Texas Transfer Bids which also operate on the relay

principle:

41), relay bid Opener must bid 4H. Responder passes.

in, relay bid Opener must bid 45

There is probably a good play for game.

The {our level can also be reserved for the first Culbertson
Asking Bid (see The Kibitzer, Sept. 22). And. of course. if Ro<
sponder has a weak hand and a preference to play the next one.

he may pass.
