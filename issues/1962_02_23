Two editorials

The present deartll of candidates for the Student Gov-
ernment presidency is alarming. But perhaps it is just
what we need. For tlle J'irst tilne in a long time we are
hearing people ask “What should student government do '3,”
instead of “What can it do?”

For the first time in a long tilne we are hearing
people admit to some of tile realities of student govern,
ment. Namely, tllat we are students first, politicians sec—
(ind; that perhaps student government should not see how
much it can accomplish but What it should accomplish
\. thin its limits.

The controversy which has beell brought about by the
Fox alld Henderson letters has turned up some interest‘
ing points concerning the pioper role of the undergraduate.
'And these points seem particularly appropos at this time.

M' Fox would seem to hold that students should
think, just i lawyers practice law and politicians engage
in politics. This, We think, is a rather monastic View, albeit
a rather attractive one. Who wouldn’t rather contemplate
Pope or listen to Bach than attend a Student Senate nieetz
il] We certainly would.

Mr. Fox has his point and it’s a valid one. But we are
more inclined to rig ee with Craig Henderson alld Mike
Hor att, (W ose ”Grey Matter” column in this issue deals
with this vcr subject). We think college is, as Hendelu
son says, ”not a place for ‘tllinking' alone, but an oppor-
[unity [or the student to test . i . ideas of other men as
i 11 as his own, and when he has made mistakes to eval-
L te his action with intelligence.”

We think, as Horwatt says, “Knowledge should gen—
erate thought alid thought should lead to action, and ace
tion to more thought.”

Now where does all this put us ill relation to student
government at Grinnell? We think the point is this that
too many students behave as Mr. Fox would suggest And
too many take the philosophy of Henderson and Horwatt
too seriously. Both views are valid but there is a middle
ground that must be sought or student government here
will 1) atrophy or 2) go the way of the I\ lkenny cats.

We are presently suffering from a reaction from too
much government, too much action. And the pendulum is
beginning to swing ill tlle oppoSlte direction. From too much
1 ction we are going towards no action at all. The fact that we
may have no need for a student government convention
this year is evidence of this. No one wants to take on the
SGA presidency because the job. which reflects the char-
acter of the government it heads, has become to large a
task, too complex a position.

Again we point to the mid-g 'ound between sedentary
contemplation and frenetic actillty for activity’s sake.
.We must find that middle ground and return to student
government at Grinnell a practical philosophy of opera-
tion.

Government at Grilincll has accomplished much in the
past year. But unless we take stock of where we are go,
ring that work may be all in rain. The Student Govern-
ment Association was instituted as a cure for our former
inefficient Student Council form of government. We have
cured many of the weaknesses of that form, But there
is a point at which to stop — a point at which to realign
a revolutionary philosophy which w s instituted to pull
government here out of the doldrllms. It was necessary
that we began to see what Student Government can do in
order to escape such torpor.

But now is the time to stop alld decide what our stil-
.dent government should do.

Vi’e hate to write an editorial like this one. Frankly,
we do it only to warn our readers not to expect too much
of a society like the one we have at Gi-inilell.

“7e refer specifically to the recent thefts of a $150

'Polaroid Land Camera from the biology department last
Thursday and of between $150 and 00 from wallets 01'
athletes competing in last Friday‘s qlladiangular swim meet
here.
' We make this point: The 13007131us students and fac-
ulty who make up Grinncll College can never afford to or»
erlook the fact that a fen of their number might be quite
capable of theft.

And it would certainly be folly to think that dishonest
persons from outside the college community have any less
access to campus buildings and events than other nonrcol-
lege people.

Those who forget that no society is completely safe
from an occasional theft — and certainly not a soceity
so founded on the integrity of its members as is Grimlell‘s
— will continue to have possesions stolen. Be careful.

Hold league lead
with two wins

l
by Phil King l

Glinllcll’s varsity basketball
squad stretched their record
to 15 victories against two sct-‘
backs by taking games troml
Carleton and St. Olaf last week—
end.

Friday night the Pioneers
beat Carleton 75765, behind Jim,
Miitlill’s 27 points. The iotlow—
ing afternoon George Gray and
Car Smith led Grinnell to anl
easy ﬁles! romp over St, Olaf.

In the Carleton game, the
Scarlet and Black, with John'
Sundell clearing the boards,
broke to a quick lead over their
opponents, But the Carls, led
by the spectacular shooting oi
sophomore substitute Mike Tier.
ney and Aleronfercllcc tor-ward
Dave Current, fought back to!
narrow Grinnell's lead to onel
point at the half. 36435. Car
Smith had ten points for the
Pioneers in this halt along with
Sundells eight.

Early in the second period
Carleton applied a run court
press, iorcing Grinnell into
several sucoissive turnovers.
The Carls took advantage oi I
this to spurt to a five point
advantage with 13 minutes re-
maining in the contest.

Then Jim Miiilin went to
work. His arching jump shots
from the outside and unerring
accuracy irom the toul line
(where he hit 11 ot 12 attempts)
pulled Crinnell from behind in.
to a sate lead.

The 033’ sophomore scored
20 points in the halt, includ—
ing 18 oi the Pioneer’s last
29. His 27 point total tor the»
game represents the individ-
ual high for a Grinnell play~
ei- this year.

Saturday atternoon the Pio—
neers had no trouble disposing
of the highlyerated Oles of St.
Olaf. George Gray’s spectacular
ball handling and accurate
shooting pulled Grinnell out to

Last. weekend after the Pioneer cagers had finished
drubbing St. Olaf, comments such as “we just. saw the
worst teilm in the Conference” fly around Darby, And
yet this was the team picked to finish nctlr the top of the
Conference.

of course'these some experts chose Grinnell for n
cozy secondediyision l" islt. The Oles (although their big
center Ltlrry Hindermann was unable to play last. weekend) ,
htld on their sound til; the outset of the season the eleven
lettermen that cti d Inst year's team into a sccond-plnce
finish (in n tie with Carleton).

Then what‘s wrong with the Oles? It seemed apparent
during last; Saturday’s gnme that their coach, Bob Gelle.
lllld as little ft notion of what’s wrongr as we do. He justt
couldn’t Seem to find the combination he wanted, as he
operated his team on the “shuttle service” principle, throw-I
ing new men into the lineup every couple of minutes.

But in any case we wish St. Olaf well, for they (on
Saturday) filling with Cnrleton (on Friday) will lie meet-
ing Monmouth in Northfield, Minn. Both the Curls and
the Oles ride into the Weekend’s action uith 7-7 Confer-
ence marks, and While both have from time to time flash-
ed brilliantly, the Cnrls with their sticky defense and
pattern offense have the best chance to knock off the
Scots and shove the Pioneers, if they will. into clear pos~
session of first place. I

A big factor in the Nol'tllficld cage action could be
the crackerebox home courts that both Carleton and St.
Olaf nossess. These gyms, when filled with screaming Oles
and Carls, often make good basketball seem like wishful
thinking.

final dual contest with Loyola

The Grinnell swimming team will splash in its last dual meet
of the season tomorrow against Loyola University of Chicago. The
meet will be held in the Grinnell pool starting at 1'30.

The Pioneers lost to Loyola
last year in a close meet, getting
nosed out other Coach Irv Si—
rnone expects a similarly light
contest again this season, and
said it should wind up a nip
and tuck affair.

Simone could not pinpoint any
event upon which the outcome
of the meet might l‘mLie. men-

tioning that Loyola had a great
team strength.
with several of his swimmers
injured, Simone felt that the
Pioneers would have an es
pecially difficult time netting
their eighth victory of the cniu
rent campaign.

Simone hopes that the Loyolal

encounter will help put the
tankers into top shape for de-
fending their Midwest Confers
enee title next weekend in
Nor-infield, Minn.

Among those injured are

and Cross, who has the flu,
probably won't swim this week-

Tuesday with a 4638 Victory

In the meet: with the Rain

down to the last relay, the 400

could have tied the contest, but
the team of Ralph Pray, Pete

Coach Irv Simone was very
pleased with the progress his
junior team has made this
year. He mentioned that the
squad was not very deep at
the start of the season, nor
did it have a great amount
of high school experience, but
has developed a lot.
