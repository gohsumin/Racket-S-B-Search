The Vietnam Moratorium
Committee has announced that

be a tragedy to miss the
opportunity to carry the an’ war

addition, they should contact
existing peace groups or
sympathetic persons in home

tor the Moratorium pointed out
that many students will return to

on the Christmas theme of

This month’s nationwide
Moratorium against the Vietnam
War is taking place today, Friday
December 12, and tomorrow,
December 13. However there is to
be no ceasing of business as usual
on the Grinnell campus, since no
olTiCial changes in the schedule of
final examinations have been
made

The Grinnell Moratorium
Committee, although reportedly
disappointed by student‘s recent
lack oi enthusiasm in planning
this month’s events, have
scheduled the sale of Christmas
cards both today and tomorrow
as the major activity on campus,
The cards, designed by the
Moratorium Committee, picture
the words “Peace On Earth”
printed over a map of Vietnam
lnaddition, lo the sale, the cards
will be distributed to the town’s
people in a doorrtOedoor
campaign during the day by
various college students.

Iii addition, the Committee will
be showing two iilms on Saturday
night ior high school aged church

Church of Christ in town.

. ’ LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Continue!

Dear Michael.

Over four years ago, while l
was 8&3 editor, “shit" first hit
the pages of Grlniicll's student
newspaper,

Thcn the shit hit thc fan.

A former Grinncll trustee,
Murray Welch, apparently
threatened to cut otf some money
to the college, and acting
president Jamcs Stauss quickly
arranged for the Board of
Publications to pass a rule that
“scatologlcal” language would
never again be used in the 5&B. I
was pissed by the whole affair.
especially when every faculty
member on the Board tthe
faculty held a 5-4 advantagei took
the line that I should have used a
better word 7 like “feces" or
even ”crap “ tiaving thus
rationalized the Situation, they
aimed a collective kick in the ass
at the student press by passing
Stauss's suggested rule. Herb
Prescott, overseer of campus
journalism, had warned me
rightly that Stauss could act like
a tiger when college funds were
endangered, But Herbie didn‘t do
a damn thing to support the
student press: a reduction of
funds to the college would have
hurt him, too.

Now there are similar
problems — only the censor has
changed. Actually, the college
seems to have forgotten its anti »
scatology rule long ago tperhaps
Welch kicked off?) — otherwise
nearly every one of the eight 5&3
editors since me would have been
booted. Strangely, all the
“illegal" scatology since 1965 has
been printed in Newton — by E.
K. Shaw and his Newton Daily
News. Now Shaw has decided
[hill [Mir 7 letter words can no
longer be printed at “his shop."
Slia e a good iicpuhlican. l'm
sure 7 is acting “he one of the
“silent majority" which Dicky
and ' "0 have whipped into a
viscious reaction against “thc
kids“

Shaw probably believes, too,
that Agnew is right about the

“iinpati'iutlc press” 730 E, K is
going to see that .. s'shop” does
not support any more of that unr
American junk, Show is probably
hcai-tsick that “his shop”
home (it the Nc\\t0n |):Iil News.
as patriotic as they come — has
given the rotten Grinnell kids tin
outlet tor their garbage [or as
long as it did. But his spirits
doubtless brighten when remem-
bering that Grilinell’s garbage
has meant over $50,000 in
business during the last five
years. .

Shaw told you that someday
you’ll understand why “that
word" is dirty. Similarly, after
my run-in over shit, Ruth
Prescott of the high . powered PR
department assured me that i
would be sorry about my lapse ol
good taste, I’m not surry about
my so - called taste . lapse, but I
am sorry about Ruth Prescott.
Murray Welch, James Stauss, the
faculty on the Board or
Publications, Herb Prescott, and
E. K Shaw, They're too secure.
and they can‘t adapt to changing
situations. What’s worse, most ot
them know what their problem is,
but they can’t do a damn thing
about correcting it.

So feel sorry ior them as you
push them aside.

support and
CONTINUE TO

STOPTANTEOMS!

Dear Mr. Brandon:

i have just read your Scarlet 5.
Black Special. There is little
reason in it.

First, Mr Shaw of the Newton
Daily News is a businessman, As
Such, it is his right to refuse to do
business with anyone. if he
chooses to lose revenue by
refusing to publish the S 5: B. that
is his right. If he wishes to deny
access to his place of business. . .
his private property. . . to you r
anyone else, that too is his right.

PRlSON BREAK...

Show me any law to the contrary.
Do you have the right to refuse to
publish this letter in the S 5. B7.
You bet you do, and will
undoubtedly exercise it.

Second, Mr. Shaw, as a bus-
inessman, has a large investment
in equipment, labor and
properly, and he is subject to the

same marketing risk as any other Q

businessman, His livelihood and
that of his employees depends
upon his success as a reputable
publisher II he degrades his
business to the level of a smut
peddler, he takes the very real
risk of loss of good will (a
valuable commodity) in his
business community and a
possible loss oi other business.

Third, lreedom of speech has *

nothing to do with Mr. Shaw’s
refusal to print the s s; B, or Mr.
Pomerenk's refusal to print the s
at E Special in the Service
Bureau. Both men left you
perfectly free to find another
printer There was no denial of
your right to print what you want
to, provided that you can find a
smut shop to do the work. I feel
that Mr. Shaw was wrong in
censoring your copy without your
knowledge, He should have
terminated his contract to print
the S at B, and so informed you, in
the first instance.

Fourth, whois intimidating you
and the ”dedicated" siaif of the s
it B? intimidation implies a
threat, and the only threat you
received was to be thrown out of
Mr. Shaw’s place of business. He
has every right to ask you to
leave his property and to eject
you forcibly if you fail to comply,
just as you would have the right
to eject me from your otfiee if I
came there and indulged in a
tantrum. .

Fifth, I would be truly
interested to know why you tool
the use of gutter language is
“free" speech. it indicates,
rather, a dearth of vocabulary on
the part of the user and a
definitely low level ot intelr
ligence. Your “Stop The War"
editorial would have been much
more eifective with a stronger
adjective than the one which was
censored. The word you used,

a warm him mop

“Which rhymes with ducking,”
projects a ludicrous and amusing
eiteet, which destroys the serious
impact of the thought behind the
words, That word, dear boy,
shocks no one who has achieved
the age lit reason. Weve heard it
before.

I also wonder why you feel you
must graphically detail the
putrcfaction appearing in the
Peterodactyl. Those who have
the stomach for it can buy their
own copies: those whose
vomiting threshhold is normal
have the right not to be
confronted with it in the college
newspaper. I wonder if you.
personally, are so titillated with
this new - to - you seaminess that
you don't realize it is beneath the
notice of anyone not suffering the
pangs of puberty.

i believe it would be to the ad»
vantage of you and your
dedicated staff to learn the power
of the English language when it is
used in a craftsmanlike manner,
It would also behoove you to
realize that people other than
college students also have rights.
and to stop having tantrums
when you get a no-no from a
responsible adult.

lurs. Edith M. Appleby

RlGHT on!

Dear Mike.

Right on, brother! Iowa
printers will try to mess over you
(look what happened to
Pierodactyl), but don’t give in!
And let no one mistake, either,
that the Iowa printer is the only
roadblock to the Grinnell
Student’s freedom of expression;
the college itself will mess over
you in a much greater way!

Both those American
capitalists and “intellectualsH
(those professing to love books
though they would burn them
instead) will try to use then'
blankety - blank blank spaces to
cover up what they don‘t like,
what’s really going on 7 all but
their own uptight way of life. . .
And if that doesn’t work they w ll
seize material before publication

. or burn it after‘

So far Iowa fascists haven’t
really got into burnings yet, but
they have seized Grilmell student
publications. Last year Iowa’s
Attorney General Richard
Turner made an illegal‘seizure

seizing Ptcro on the grounds it

ated Board of Publications, in
cohoots with President Glenn
(defender of truth, justice and the
English language) Leggett, for
“reasons they wouldn’t explain”
seized the 1966 college yearbook
without prior hearing.

Right now, a question everyone
should be asking is where was the
Grinnell College Board of
Publications 7 including those
great “free thinkers” Charles
Cleaver and Herbie Prescott 5:
Co. — when your newspaper
faced censorship, Did the Board
raise a single cry of protest when
E, K. Shaw refused to print the
Ssh with controversial words in]
it? No, of course not, because.
exactly as in the case of the '55
yearbook, the Board of
Publications represented not the
interest of students’ free
expression but rather that of die
college’s status quo image.

In the Spring of ’67. as editor of
the 5&3 at that time (then called
The Grinnell Reporter) I ceased
publication in protest when the
yearbook was banned. In doing
so, I suggested reorganization of
Grinnell's system of publications
in order that it be student
controlled rather than dominated
by the faculty ~ administration
block. Consideration of change
was completely ignored,
however, and, since that time,
the situation, as reported to me,
has even deteriorated. In my day,
one at the worst forms of censor-
ship occurred simply by means of
selection of editors: Students
whose opinions seemed to
contorm to status quo Grinnell
standards could be chosen over
those who questioned the estab-
llshmenl. But now, as i ‘
understand it. fullilling the
position of editor is further
limited by a statement each
applicant must sign stating he or
she will comply with Board of
Publications definitions of good
taste. What to print, etc. in other
words, who becomes the editor of
the Student paper» the student

applicant or the Board?
Obviously the campaign for re-
structuring of Grinnell
publications must be resur-
rected, At this time I would

Suggest, briefly. 1, Investigation

of the formation of an
independent student corporation
which would be responsible for
all student publications Students
Nould thereby enjoy freedom of
:pcech and the administration
:ould relax legally. Students‘
iuestions about legal and
inancial matters could be
nswered by experts in these
ields, possibly from Des Moines.

lians will recalls in 1967, the idependent corporation, by the

 

way, is not unrealistic in regard
to student publications, The

CANCEL!

Dear Sir:

We have today received our
edition of Scarlet and Black with
your editorial insert, Please
cancel our subscription to your
paper immediately, as we do not
care to subscribe to a paper with
such an irresponsible attitude by
its editor, Freedom of speech
and freedom oi press are not
licensed to insult the decency of
the public.

We certainly expect that an
adult attitude be exhibited by
collegeragc students, We
heartily endorse and commend
Mr. Shaw (or taking his stand for
the side of decency. Futhermoro,
we believe obscenity laws of the
United States prohibit an insert
as was sent to our home We do
know the laws of Trinidad and
Tobago prohibit the mailing of
obscene and pornographic
literature.

Yours very triily.

RESPONSlBleES!

Dear Mr. Brandon:

You have not been censored so
much as you have been reminded
of your responsibilities!

For instance, in your editorial
of November 21, you state that
Mr. Shaw could not answer, to
your satisiaction, “what is dirty
about “that word?” Your choice
of “that word” to describe a
terrible war puts the respon»
sibility squarely on you, as
editor, to answer that same
question. You are guilty of
following the many who have
been equating a commonly used
sex term with the horrors and
dirt of war. Those of uS who are
now parents or college students
learned long ago to accept ”luck"
as a crude but honest enough
word, and have round it used
quite legitimately in literature
and life, It has been around as a
shock term iorcver, but now it's
being borrowed out at context
once again by those oi you who
consider yourselves “sex »
enlightened", for heaven's sake‘

You have been served fairly
and well by Grlnllell College in
being allowed to print the
explanation sheet. The collcgc
need not and should not cater to
you beyond this point.

Grinnell has its Pterodactyl
which is printed and distributed
with surprising regularity
despite its problems, The campus
does not need another outlet for
this kind of experimental
journalism. It needs, instead, a
newspaper to tackle the tar more
dillicult job of seeking solutions
through a courageous approach

that eliminates the crutch of
stupidly oliensive terms For
instance, alter reading the news
item about tiie Pterodactyl in the
so 13, we were ready to rush out
to buy it because it tantalized our
prurient interests. Your
explanation oi the black smudges
gave it away as another “Big
Yawn" You went and told it all!

If you are indeed interested in
what may be a very real threat oi
censorship. look to the Open
Forum oi today’s Sunday
licgisier. You will see how
concerned citizens are debating
this age . old problem once again
When you have a worthwhile
cause, digni itas being oi worth
by the choice or thoiightiul terms
or persuasion Shop . worn shock
tactics belong only to the unde-
servmg cause.

Dear Mr. Brandon.

As a kindergarten teacher,
dedicated to free speech, even
as yourself, I am very iamiliar
With the “naughty” words little
boys love to use in an attempt to
shock me. My policy has been to
allow the use of such words under
the assumption that as a tow
years and a little discrimination
descend upon the little fellows
their language may become
slightly more reiined, i iind I
must question my methods. Can
you tell me, did your
kindergarten teacher shush you
when you wanted to yell “shit,
shit, shit,” (as a little boy did this
very day) 7 Did that repression
lead to this delayed concern you
have for such words? Or did she
allow you to do it, thus
establishing a habit of juvenile
expression? I really must know
soon, as tomorrow is another day
and who knows what those little
rascals may say!

Anxiously awaiting your reply.

Yours truly.

Michael —

i have been iollowing the plight
of Grinlicll , based publications
with great interest the past iew
months. Having known Mr, Shaw
for several years and having
always admired him as an easy
man with whom to work i was
surprised at his recent
aberrations vis-a-vis the
venerable 5ch I would imagine
but have no way at knowing that
there were pressures irom other
directions on Mr, Shaw. ii you
would, try to be kind and patient
and try to understand Mr Shaw
He has had a goal or a set of goals
for which he has been working
hard iora long time These goals
may be unarticulated or maybe
prc . conscious but they are very
real nonetheless. He has been
seeking tamong other things of
course) a paid up mortgage,
respcet train the pastor, iriendly
nods from the neighbors when he
meets them on the streets, that
all around warm, secure feeling
ot being part oi a pleasant iowa
village. These goals, which we
may not admire but with which
we really should not be too light,
may have been threatened by

printing hick and similar words -

You know his neighbors may
have started talking about him
and nooding curlly on the streets.
in worse yet not nodding at all.
Perhaps the pastor threatened to
preach a sermon about him at the
daily news. Worse yet, his
mortgage payments may have
been th cateiied when the larger
adverti ers in town hinted darkly
that ads for their pure January
white sale could not be printed on
a press that had been beiouled by
fucking. Or perhaps. more kindly
and not impossible, Mr. Shaw
really does feel those words are
evil and dirty and as an act oi
principle he is giving up all the
money the son pays him to print
the paper rather than violate uae
principle he has about those and
similar words, So try to
understand iihe wants to keep his
press pristine and vninal Don’t
attack Mr. Shaw personally. He’s
really a fine guy, good to dogs
and children. You can’t expect
much more than that these days.
or course, I wouldn‘t want my
daughter educated by him but
then I wouldn‘t care if my son had
a beer with him.

To the 55:8:

I can sympathize with Mike
Brandon‘s exasperation in his
search for a printer who would
print the 85:13 without censoring
it. However, I am disturbed that,
in fixing the blame for his
difficulties, he should conclude
that, “As far as freedom of the
press is concerned, America is a
gyp." (8&8 Special, Decr5)

Freedom oi the press, as i
understand it, guarantees the
right of the individual to publish
whatever he wishes to publish, as
long as in doing so he does not
break any other laws Freedom
to publish presumably implies
freedom not to publish, also.

Mr, Brandon obviously
disagrees with Mr Shaw and Mr.
Sutherland on matters of social
propriety. But the printers were
free not to publish Mr. Brandon’s
material, and Mr. Brandon was
free to take his business
elsewhere, as he did. Freedom oi
uie press does not mean, and
certainly ought not to mean, that
a printer must enter into a
private business contract against
his wishes. Mr. Brandon may
think little of the printers'
reasons for reiusing to print, but
nowhere in this personal conflict
is lrccdom oi the press at stake

in fact, it would seem that
exercising ireedom oi the press is
one proiessional principle which
Messrs. Brandon, Shaw, and
Sutlicrlandhave in common, The
fact that they all were iree, under
law, to make public what they
thought appropriate for
publication, is testimony that, as
Mr as lrccdom oi the press s
concerned, America is not a gyp,
Mr. Brandon’s inconvenience and
irritation notwithstanding

To the Editor:

These words are prompted both
by Sally Moore's article on the
“newwoman” two wecks ago and
Robert Finley‘s reply last week.

I suspect it was Mrs. Moore’s
intention to excite wider discus»

although Mr. Finley was clearly
responding to his own cartoon

male paranoia of Mr. Finley’s

that continued explanation oi

“demands” of the liberated
woman and, more important, its

As a movement, women’s lib-

successful philosophy oi the
Black revolution. Just as self -
pride and racial consciousness
have become a mobilizing force
ior Black people. so militant
women, considering themselves
as a group another of society’s
“niggers”, have set about to
change their image, both in their
own eyes and the eyes oi men.
The analogy is not wholly inap-
propriate: Mr Finley's cartoon
stereotypes at women (including
the positive stereotype or woman
as bustling, happy homemaker,
“baking wholesome bread" 7
and scrubbing wholesome
toilets?) have infected the minds
of women as well, limiting their
perception at alternative liie -
styles to rigid catcgorics- One is

cannot safely prevent the birth of

And by this situation Mr. Finley’s

l have greatly oversimplified
many complex problems, but
there is one final matter that
concerns me. Women are in
many cases their own worst
enemies. It is not easy to be a
career woman and a wife and
mother simultaneously. Time is
short and the emotional demands
are great. Most women, Wltll a

they marry or have babies, and
employers are understandably
suspicious, particularly of young
women. Again, a woman looking

concerned primarily with getting
out ot the house or earning a little
extra money, cannot expect an
absorbing position or a
competitive salary.

The double pull is always there

mean that one lives only for one-

Yet the nearest use or pesticides
was thousands of miles away:

takes years to break down

Why do we need DDT? It has
been proven that an integrated
pest control program will be
safer, just as effective, and much
less costly. This type or program
relies upon beneiieial predator
insects, with limited use of some
chemicals, In California the Cost
01 pest control with strong
chemicals on alfalfa was 12
million dollars a year. but today,
with integrated pest control, it is
only 3 million dollars, with
almost no pest problem
remaining. A similar result was
obtained on the California cotton
crop Wouldn't such a program
make sense in Iowa?

Some states have already
banned DDT. litany lowans,
including some state lawmakers,
are calling for it to be outlawed
here, and tor a through study of
other strong chemical pesticides.

it is true that we are using
much less DDT in Iowa now lllan
in past years. but we still have it,
and did use it on the recent army
worm problem. All use of it
should be stopped.

What can we do? We can write
to our state lawmakers, to
newspapers. and to our governor

We could plan a statewide
moratorium on pesticides, and
pollution in general; plans tor a
national moratorium on pollution
are no being made.

NOW that the use of DDT is
decreasing in Iowa, let’s ban it
completely. I am e lowa

To the Editor:

While 1 e ‘oyed Protessor
Nasser‘s pe -eptive and superbly
written review oi “Midnight
Cowboy." I am sorry to have to
call attention to all error in
elementary logic committed by a
philosopher This is the use or
two word as though they had the
same maiiing; “liberal" and
”ruling class " The name of this
tallaey is “equivocation”
Prolessor Nasser uses it to beg
the question.

There are liberals in the ruling
class tKennedy, McCarthy,
Rockclellcl', Lindsayt; there are
liberals out of it (me). But there
are also people who are not
liberals in the ruling class
(Nixon, Thurmond, Ellender,
Goldwater), and these people,
whom we call “conservatives,"
slow and obstruct the liberal
revolution because they do not
want it to happen.

Professor Nasser speaks of the
diselilranchised, who are also the
Concern of the liberal, The goal
of thelibcral revolution sinee1932
has been to clllranchise the
disenlrallchtsed, hut to do it
through persuasion, Because or

liberals has been necessarily

slow. but [hat it has also been
rcdl. substantial, and durable, I
call on any candid and impartial
obserrcr to judge

[I l’rnlcssnr Nasser has any
quarrel with the liberals, it lnust
lic either in their arms or their
methods. One always has the
suspicion about the New Left that
its adherents seek not so much to
remedy injustice as to topple the

mg order so that in the
resultant scramble they may
[arm a new one with themselves
at the top What do you want to
do [or the disenfranchised,
Prolcssor Nasser?

Or, it Professor Nasser does
not object to enfranchising the
disenlranchlsed. his objection
must lie in the liberal
methodology, which essentially is
that ot persuading opponents and
the uncommitted to the necessity
of ret'orin Perhaps we have
round the real objection here, ior
Professor Nasser writes “that
some species oi revolutionary
action Is the only solution to
their lthc disenfranchised's)
plight.” The language here is
much like that which Orwell
complains about in “Politics and
and the English Language,”
are you talking about when you
say “revolutionary action,”
Protessor Nasser? Do you mean
“shooting people,” or what? You
must remember that you are
talking about a revolution of
about twenty percent or the
population against about eighty,
and you must realize that any
solution which brings such iorces
into Violent controntatlon must
needs leave the diselitranchised

tar worse oit than tney are now.
My own personal vision is or a
world in which all men are
brothers and each is tree to
achieve his own happiness in his
own way, so long only as he does
not re net the happiness oi
other . That is i believe a
liberal vision l invite you to join

ought to have done and there was
no help ior it.

And there were many abiding in

over their books all night but it

But some there were who rose

And these were known as wise

And the multitude arose and ate
