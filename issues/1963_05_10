Spring E v

Two “Spring Riots" that didn't
quite come off, a two hour long
water right, and red-hot Spring
Day headed this week‘s heavy
social calendar.

On Sunday night North Carn-
pus erupted into one of the
longest and noisiest water fights
on record, as an estimated 150
students tried at one time or
another to drown the guy run—
ning by

On Monday night an unoi-
ficial and unplanned Spring
Riot started with the Burling
library lights being cut off,
continued with men breaking
into the women’s dorms and
successfully completing a
parity raid, and ended before
hours with a Mac Field bone
fires
On Tuesday a planned Riot
was highlighted by the CuerF
and AWS Board members being
kidnapped, A dance which was
planned by the Central (Riot)
Committee ended again at mid
night (Women’s hours) instead
of continuing as the riotcrs had
hoped till 2 am.
Spring Day was highlighted
by Woody Herman’s Swinging
Herd, by Rawso‘n and Haines
winning the AFROTC Spring
Day events, and by a shuttle
bus to Rock Creek Lake.

Childish RIO‘l‘S

During the past week thousands of Ne-
groes peacefully demonstrated in the strilfe—
torn ci V of Birmingham, a crisis was oc—
curl lg in Haiti, and Grinnell students pare
tieip ted in two S1 'lng Riots, a grand wu-
tel' fight, and Sp 'ng Day.

While 2,400 Negroes chanted, "We want
to be free," a few hundred Grinnell stun
dents either condoned or actively aided in
two Spr g Riots. The first of these was
destructive.

Windows and screens were broken
staged the first succesr
ful panty raid in modem Grinnell his-
tory, This raid was a by—product of at-
tempts to spur the women into defying
hours,

The next night a less spontaneous riot
occurred. Dittoefl messages saying, “Toe
night is the real thing;" were distributed.

The Central (Riot) Committee asked the

woman students to be out of the quad till
2 am.

This riot aborted, as too many stu-
dents were in cl ofyan overdose of play
groundelike activi es.

Stephen B. Wood, dean of men, called
the riot “childish,” and for once the Scar»
let and Black would like to go on record as
agreeing with him. The Riots, if they
proved anything, showed that on the whole,
student responsibility is at a low ebb. It
also showed that, at what we claim to be

The Riots were negative, if they were
anything: They put the Student Govern-

in a bad bal ining posi on when he asks
the administ dtion to delegate more power
to the students. Is this the type of thing
the administration can expect if the stu-

Toynbee: Remain in Human World

A Grinnell College audience
Monday was told that the great-
est been of a combined classical
and religious education is that
it is an antidote to the intelleCr
tual error and spi tual sin of
assuming that man is the high—
est spiritual presence in the uni-
verse

“All higher religions and phir
losophies oppose‘ and condemn
this anthropocentric view,", Ar-
nold J. Toynbce, Heath visiting
professor of history, said

to make sortie: from it, drag~
ging his chains, inic otbori
lworlds, Anyone who has had a
Western classical education in
Latin and Greek can look at the
contcmporary world, not, pen
haps, with a Grcck’s or Roman's
eyes, but with a fifteenthcen-g
tury Italian humanist’s eyes,"

Fashimi Allotment

Since the newspaper Is the only permanent
record of the vital issues that confront us from
week to week, we can all probably guess what
this column is going to be about.

One of the most interesting accusations to
arise from this Week’s first Spring Riot was
that it was “uncreative.” Not only that but so
many people were ashamed of the entire enter-
prise that they staged another one the next night,
presumably to make up in organization what
they lost in spon}aneity,

It seems that nobody can quite decide what
they want. A ”creative" riot would evidently
involve something bizarre. like the theft of Darby
gym. On the other hand, this woiild probably
require a certain amount of coordinnicdcffort.
especially in finding someplace to put it; and
such things are contrary to the Grinnell student's
general independence in thinking for himself,
and thus never getting anything like that done.

Those who somehow managed to get away
with it without disappearing forever can boast
of the day when they not only cut oft all the lights
in the library, but also chained up all the doors
and trapped ‘ everybody inside. Of cause, the
gravity of this accomplishment may be exagger-
ated, because nowadays such an act would im»
prison the entire student body instead of just
the students.

But that sort of thing is contrary to the whole
‘dca anyway A riot is supposed to be a violent

order. and so maybe those critics of this Week's
activities can only be ashamed of the lack of vi —
lelice. Mr. Walden, on the other hand, can prob-
ably be somewhat concerned by inc amount of
violence done his window screens, and must only
regret that it’ll be hard to collect the half mil-
lion dollars he figures it’ll cost to get them

Forum For Descent

fixed

The real issue here is the mysterious naiui-c
of Grinnell disorder. It seems that whatever
disorder is created during the day, suddenly
disappears at midnight. Grinncll girls are evi~
dently creatures of habit But because this
punches holes in the earlier notion that people
around here are too independent to function as
a group, we need some kind of new theory for
all future Spring Riots.

1 don't think we ought to take the adminis
'tration to heart when they claim this sort of
thing is childish A proper mature sort of dis-
order would no doubt emulate the attitudes at
Carleton. where the editor of the newspaper
suggested a sit-in of all men in the women’s
halls and vice verse. I somehow imagine such
adult behavior would simply be too much to
contend with.

So I w’ould like to propose that instead of
one riot every year, We take the events of this
week to heart and have two from now on. One
could be a master plot of gigantic proprtions.
involving the disappearance of something im-
portant or valuable. The sophistication of this
enterprise could gradually improve to the point
where a lot of good might even get done, For
next year I suggest a plot to get Dean Wood's.
legendary tape recorder and all its used reels.

The other night of rioting would include such
traditional aspects as the abduction of student
officials and the waiving of women’s hours. Only
from then on there would be no threat of dis-
ciplinary action, because the student body could
use whatever they hzid stolen the night before
with a certain bargaining power. lf any girl
get fined for staying out late. we’d simply to
refuse to return whatever vital' part of the coir
lcge that was missing.

 

Poor Communication Criticized

Delivering the last of a series
of lectures on “The Philosophy
of History,” and using “An Ap-
proach Through 2: Classical Edu-
cation” as his subject, the noted
British historian added:

“This education in a classical
culture and in a higher religion
has a double advantage. It does
not take one out of our human
world into the non—human
world of protons and nebulae.
This is of grcat practical value,
because human beings are good
at dealing with human nature.
Therefore, we cannot afford to
neglect the humanities, To drop
these and fly off into physical
science is a form of escapism
and will bring its nemesis.

”At the same time, a classical
education, while keeping one in
the human world, takes onc out
of the particular contemporary
cell of it in which he happens
to have been located by the ac-
cident of birth.

“or course, one can never
brcak away completely from
his own time and place, but a
classical education enables him

of communication. One of the
things that sets Grinnell above
the run of the mill college is
the generally excellent commune
ication bctwccn faculty and stu~
dents. There are, as i see it, no
great stumbling blocks in the
path of faculty-administration
c o m m u meation. Unfortunately,
there is no communication be-
tween the students and the ad-
ministration.

How might a student at Grin-
neil communicate to the ad
ministration? There seems to be
only one avenue open to such
a student, the avenue cl protest.
Since the student has virtually
nothing to say about any ad-
ministrationul edict, the only
methods by which he can ex-
press his fcclings

either acceptance or protest,

in turn, there is only one
path by which the administrative
personnel of this college can talk
to the students, And that is the
imperative path, the path of

 

giving orders. As l understand students, but the students have

the rules and regulations of this
institution, there is absolutely
no provision for either the stu
dents or the administration to
discuss, argue, learn, debate, ex»

himself as an eternal picket. It
is now the student’s responsibil-
ity to modify this role. The ad-
ministration, which has emerged
from this discussion in what is
probably a better light than it
deserves, must decide to listen
to the students, and listen to
them honestly,

“Grinnell is justly proud of

them yourself from the neigh—
boring high spots when you’re

from the old stories that when
the first settlers came there was
not a tree in sight. When

“Identification may be aided

of a series of mutually exclu-

such as monocot and dicot. You
eliminate on down until you
reach the species. Some vari»

to wait until they leaf out or

them specifically,” said Gra—

He continued, “We have sev-

Baseball Team to Play Three This Weekend

The Grinnell baseball squad,
fresh off a comeJromebehind,
ninth—inning zel victory over
Coe. hopes to improve their
3—5 conference record in a three
game home stand this weekend
against Knox and Monmouth.
Today the Pioneers host Knox
in a single nine inning contest,
while tomorrow they take on
Monmouth in two seven inning
games.

Before the Tuesday victory
over Coe, the Pioneers had
dropped a Saturday doublehead»
er at Cornell, 271 and 21-3. in
the opener Denny Hanssen
pitched a four hitter and struck
out nine. A lo-run Cornell out—
burst in the third inning of the
nightcap broke open a 3‘2 ball
game and turned it into a rout,

in Tuesday's game Hanssen
came up vvith another fine hur-
ling performance giving up only
two hits while striking out l1
on the way to a 2-1 victory.
Still, his fine pitching effort
would have come to naught had
it not been for some ninth in
ning heroics by the Pioneer
batters

, Senate Approves Reconsideration
of Men's, Women's House Rules

By Richard Ohlemeyer
S K: B Staff Writer

Changes in the Men‘s and
Women’s House Rules were ap-
proved for ﬁrst consideration by
the Senate last night. Of special
interest was the change in the
drinking rule proposed by the
executive cabinet..lt includes a
section of the lowa Code and
would permit students over 21
to drink in their rooms. Ah 3]»
ternatlvc rule, suggested by
Vance Oppeman, cites more of
the Iowa Code and would pro»
hibit consumption of alcoholic
beverages by college students on
publicly used college property,
This rule would be enforced by
“college authorities," but penal-
ties would be restricted to ﬁnes.
Each of the two rules has cer-
tain weaknesses to which objecA
tions have been raised,

Other proposed changes in the
Men‘s House Rules included the
changing of Article 1 to a pre»
amble, the assumption of re-
sponsibility by the Council of
House Presidents tor maintalnr
ing quiet in the library, and a
new hall orientation rule.

other proposed changes H] the
Women's House Rules involved
moving the Women’s Primary
Court from the Women’s House
Rules to the BysLaws to the
AWS constitution, a redefinition
of calling hours, and a disorder
ly conduct rule.

r A Senate Judiciary Committee
lreport was given by Chairman
Vance Opperman The commit-
tee recommended. among other
‘things, that a statute providing
la penalty for perjury be drawn
up. that a list of rules and their
lpenalties be compiled, and thrill
court records be kept in the
SGA oﬁice,

Paul Courtright iniormcd the
Senate that a letter complaina
ing of poor soda machine serw
icing had been sent to the Pepsi
lCoIa Company in Des Moincs.
Anyone who is due a refund
lshould send a note to Courtright
via campus mail.

The nomination of Susan Tay-
lor for an appointment to the
High Court was narrowly dos
feated following a 4-1 recom-
mendation for approval by the
Budgets, Nominations, and Con-
stitutions committee.

SGA President Jack Chapman
announced that Grinnell will be
