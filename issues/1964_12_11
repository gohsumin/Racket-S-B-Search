Reorganization Plan Proposed; It
Would lnslilule 'Advisory Council'

Wednesday night the Student
S e n a t a considered several
amendments to the SGA Con-
,situation which would, if
passed, replace the Senate with
an Advisory Council.

The Duties of the Council, ac-
cording to the proposed amend-
ment would be: ”The Council
shall make policy for the Stu-
dent Government Association
on all matters except conduct
regulations and residence hall
regulations. These matters will
be decided in lent session of
the Council, the C of HP, and
the AWS Board, at which ses~
sion each Cannon and Board

member will have equal votingl

rights.’

The Council would consist of
one representative from each
hall plus the SGA President, the
AWS Board President, and the
C of HP President.

Wolf, Fuson Named
To Top 8&8 Posts

The two top positions on the
1965 Scarlet and Black were

ﬁlled last Tuesday when the
Board of Publications named

John Wolf editor and Harold,

Fuson business manager for
the coming year.

Wolf is a junior biology ma-
jar and is currently 3&3 manr
aging editor. Euson is a sopho‘
more American studies major
and has been serving as asso-
clate editor of the 1965 Cyclone,

The other Candidate for edir

passed, would also remove the
office of speaker of the Senate
and would remove the Social
CoordinaLor from the Execu-
tive Cabinet. It would also elim-
inate the Social Planning Board
whose functions would be tak-
en over by the Social Coordi-
nating Committeel

The intention: of these
amendments, according to the
officials of Student govern-
lnenl, are to “streamline decis-
ion-making and opinion aru-
culation," and to “coordinate
all SGA activities better than
now.”

The amendments would “fuse,

the Executive Cabinet and leg? by the 18 Grinnell Sngrs, with

lslative body, remove the Exec l
:35 soloists for two of the six

llthE cabinct yew while giv-
lng them a larger role in Coun-
cil decision,” according to a
statement to the Student Sen-
ale.

According to SGA President,
Phil Johnson, the Student Sen-
ate will only discuss the pro-
posed amendments, this week,
while Consideration of their
adoption will take place after
the Christmas Vacation. Ac-
cording Lo the SGA constitution,
cbnstitutional amendments may
be proposed by a majority vote
of the student Senate but then
must be passed by an all stu-
dent vote.

Prof Proposes Periodic Assembly of College Community

To the Editor:

There are some great events
here at Grinnell that are known
only to a few. More members
of the college community
should have been told in ad-
vance last week to spare an
hour for Dr. Li of the Univer-
sity of Iowa and for Mr. David
Maitland of Carleton College.
I have heard many lectures in
art history, but never one so
good as Li's on “Sung Land~
scape Painting.” I have heard
many talks on question and.
answer, on hearing and listen
ing and responding. but never
one so good as Maltland’s “On
Listening.” Robert McMillan
and Roger Eldridge are modest
men. They didn’t shout at you
when their guests came. But
these men had something very
important to say, said their
messages well. Many students
who didn’t miss these events
were deeply impressed and ex-
pressed regret at the small st-
tendance.

I have often missed a good
lecture or concert or play. I
used never to miss a good mo»
Vie. Why? Because I had two
friends who followed the re-
views and who alerted me
Weeks in advance so that I
could budget my time. I miss
these friends very much; oh, I
still have one who knows mo»
vies and I turn to him for ad-
vice. Why can’t someone pro-
vide information about speak—
ers and artists and scientists
who are to appear? Surely the
Grinnell Information Service
can get the ordinary cursus
vitarum, the who's who stuff.
But this needs to be supple-
mented by someone who knows
the guest personally and can
relate his interests to ours. I
would like here to express a

 

word of appreciation to Mr.

Eldridge and to his secretary
for having provided copies of
Samuel Miller’s most recent
articles. I found them in the
R. A. R. and scanned each of
them. They helped me to un-
derstand what the Gates Leo-
turei‘ was driving at. And in-
deed I picked up a book of
Dean Miller after he departed
and followed up the theme of
metaphor in my philosophy
Classes. May I add that I find
every public event a great stim»
ulus to work in my field and
never. well, or almost never, a
distraction.

Perhaps students think of
Grllinell College as a place for
lectures, plays, and concerts
but not a place for sermons,
The sermons are indeed inte-
grally related to the worship of
God and one may say that
there is no God, or that what-
ever cosmic force there is nev-
er asks in he prayed to or to
be praised in song. Or at least
doubtless he never told you that
one day in seven was sacred
and that you should go to His
house to listen to His prophet
proclaim the Word, You may
add that this version of meta—
physics is primitive arld out<
moded and that you hate to
aid in the continuation of sup-
erstition. Positively'you may
say that the spiritual life can
be better cultivated through
the ministrations of the Lenox
Quartet, and our moral fer-
vor better geared into the Civil
Rights Movement. Music and
desegregation, you may argue,
are the religion of the modern
intellectual, along with fine
sexual relations.

I should like to answer these
difficulties not from my own
experience but from testimony
of sir Julian Huxley. Huxley
is not only a great biologist but

 

Berry Discusses Forum Uses.
Responds to 'Deluded Sectors'

To the Editor:
The Forum has just opened
and already indignant protests

of “betrayal” can be heard
among certain deluded sectors
of the student body. “They're
trying to civilize us” runs the
hue and cry among certain
young rustics. My own re-
sponse to these pathetic whim»
pers is “Get off it, Jack, you're
just. yellow!" because I think
these people misunderstand
the intentions of the Forum’s
creators.

For my money the Forum
represents a recognition by the
powers that be that we students
have had a legitimate vexation
with the former drabness of
Grinnell. In fact we must have
made our case awfully well by

the looks of things, because the.

ladylove’s earlobes in one of
ttli windowside alcoves. bash
the piano keys, giggle, guffaw,
wail roar, pursue Britomart
over the hill and dale, etc, the
Forum is not going to be of<
fended. The Forum is so com-
pletely padded, upholstered,
berugged, hedraped, patient,
motherly etc. that a great deal
of ructions and cacapho‘ny are
not going to upset its compos-
ure.

As a matter of fact, I think
the planners oi the Forum will
be disappointed if students
don't tear up the pea patch and
sow a few wild oats in their
little castle, All they expect is
that we don’t carve our initials
in the furniture, don’t spill pipe
ashes on the rugs without clean—
ing them up, and dont hold

I would not be using Sir Jul<

I should like also to add a
few words from the address of
F. S. C. Northrop. Northrop is
a philosopher of science, pro-
fessor emeritus of Yale Law
School, author of The Meeting
of East and West, and altogeth-
er one of the finest teachers
that my friend Klausner and I
have ever had. At least we do
not brush his thought away
lightly. Northrop spoke in 1954
when Beloit rededicated its
Chapel. I believe his points
about the relevance of a Chapel
Program to the integral life of
our community and of the rela-
tion of other fiEIds to the ideas
there presented are true,

conclusion is in some respects
not wholly untrue,

I have dealt with an aspect
in which improvement could be
made. It depends upon no ap-

on no grant of money. It de-
pends only upon our will and

well pleased with their speculations to launch the Betsy Ross
Flag and Banner Company to produce these unique creations

Mainly because the first banners were the products of
"pop” and “hard edge” artists associated With the Graham
galleries. the banner in this stage of American history is
largely thought of as a vehicle for express1on of the most
modernistic trends in American art.

The banners are being produced by a group of New
.York’s seventh avenue seamstresses, normally in the ﬂag-
making business, under the close supervision of Mr. Graham’s
avantgarde artists, from whose “cart ons” or designs for the
basic pattern of the banner is sewn the final product in
groups of twenty with the artist’s name monogrammed on
the rear of each.

The banners have been made in various materials (nylon,
plastic, silk) and sizes, but are most commonly textured in a
felt wool combination and have dimensions of five feet by
seven t'eet. The banner is a revolutionary art concept in that
its polished aluminum rods allow it to be hung easily without
frame or glass casing and its durable texture allows it to be
rolled up compactly and even regularly dry»clcaned. Most
importantly, the large size and moderate cost of the banner
(produced so far for $300-$600) answer an immediate need of
the architect and designer for furnishing his structures with
attractive and practical art objects.

The banners hanging on a permanent basis in the
Forum are entitled, “The New Old Glory" and “Black and
Red,” and are the works of Robert Indiana, and Jack Younger
man respectively.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Touch of Camelot Invades Forum;
Wall Hangings Echo Old Tradition

By Wayne Stengel

With all the administration’s pride in both the attractive
utility and unique qualities of our new Forum, it should come
as a surprise to no Grinnellian to learn that the union grill
is furnished complete with a touch of Camelot. This

Much like the heraldic banners vividly depicting families’
coats of arms dating from thirteenth century Europe in form,
this art form is the direct product of the long 1962»63 New

In an effort to publicize Jensen 5 work as best he could
Graham suggested that the artist paint a huge flag to fly out-
side the galleiy. Graham 5 plan worked perfectly and Jensen's
abstract, brilliantly- colored flag attracted so much attention
in its own right from Manhattan's art students and some wellv

Gala Social Evening~ Opens Forum:
Students lniiiale Colorful Building

By Cynthia Brust
Santa Claus payed an early visit to Grinneil last Friday,
bringing with him the Ford Foundation’s gift to the campus
—- the College Forumi Wrapped in shiny glass, with concrete
ribbons and wooden trimmings, this is easily the biggest and
most elaborate toy any Grinnellian has ever received.

The Forum’s official opening was a 4-hour gala featuring
the adequate but not spectacular entertainment of the Rivieras
and Miss Maxine Sellers But the Forum itself was definitely
the star. Just wandering through the building in the after-
noon was much more fun — gaping at the first permanent
student center at Griiineli and peoplerwatching. “It’s beauti-
ful!" almost everyone even the most blase, agreed. But there
was also a feeling that this was something too rich for the
Grinnell campus blood; that no»one would ever be able to feel
at home in‘this glass palace.

By the end of that first evening, most of the cynics had
had their say, and even the seniors managed to talk about
the Forum without mouthful references for the “log cabin"
of the past. _The carpet in the “too stiff and formal” South
Lounge was muddy and sand had been spilled from an ash

tray. The dance floor in the North Lounge, the pool tables
and the eating facilities had been duly initiated. Almost

everyone could now tell north from south unerringly, and
those who had figured out the maze of the lower level proudly
-. conducted grand tours for their bewildered friends. Already
the Forum was a part of us, and soon staring in awe at the
Forum will be just another way to tell a “prospective.”

Some ideas about the future of the Forum were very
apparent even at the end of its first evening. The smallest of
the Private dining rooms are going to be very popular, and

the girls of the Quad may well be forced to drop their anti- \

domestic stance for the romantic coziness of these tiny kit-
chens and dining rooms. The music room might just surprise
everyone by being too small from the very start,’ especially
since coming attractions are made known to the whole campus.
Cafie del Foro will continue to epitomize the luxury and
almost sinful extravagance of the building, as well as its de-
lightful “so different from the rest of the campus" atnios
phere. And somebody will just have to find a way to dim the

’91ights in at least a few corners, for “interdigitation” is not
going to go out of style at Grinnell,

It's colors are overwhelming, its facilities exciting, its im-
portance to the campus awesome. Senior or prospective, fresh-
man and even faculty, Maxine Sellers seems to have summed it
up the best —— the College Forum is nothing but “supercalifra-
gilisticexpia'lilioscléu’s!""""' " ' " ' " ” ’ ' ' " '

 

Scenes at the opening

Forum were noted for
l a r g e numbers of stu-
dents enjoying the many
facilities of the new
building and its pro-
grams. ‘ -

Included in the open-
ing night activities were
a performance by Chi-
cago folk singer Maxine
Sellers (right) and a
rock 'n roll dance (lie-
low) featuring the Rivi-
eras.

Other facilities of the
building which were
available for the first
time last Friday night
are the grill and the
game room (above).

Scarleleers Sing

Musical Variety;

Tanager: Vocalize Female .Talenl

By Renate Reicha

From “Honey" with a bebop
beat to “Grinnell. Grinnell"
the Searleteers present a pleas-
ing variety of music. Craig
Welterlen, senior, the leader of
the group, describes' them as
“a bunch of guys singing to-
gether for the fun of it." Dick
Bailly, Jim Stith, and Al Ross-
rnan, juniors; Tom Pope, Bill
Hughes, Dick Lovell, anti John
Phillips, sophomores, comprise]
this year’s Scarleieers, a'
“young group" as Welterlen:
puts it. ‘ e K i

While not affiliated with Grin-
nell, College, the Scarleteers'
are all Grinnell students and
most of them are active in
other campus musical activi-
ties. They also make tradition-
al appearances on campus,
such as their annual Mother's
Day performance. The group
also performs off-campus en-
gagements, utilizing a variety
of music from traditional bar~
bershop to serious Brahms.
Practices are held Weekly. rer
gardless of whether or not the
group has an engagement, and
the Scarleteers arrange much
of their own music. Entertain-
ment value is stressed and
songs are accommodated to fit
the audience, A typical per-
former will usually include
so me barbershop harmony,
semi-serious music, and a spec-
iall‘y number.

Tryouts for the Scarleteers
are held in the spring. No pre-
vious experience is required,
but sought-after qualities are
music comprehension, stage
presence, and the ability to
blend well with the group. The
main objective, as Welterlen
stressed, is to give a good per-
and have a good
tlme while doing it. This spir-
it was plainly exemplified dure
ing Dance 1. ME: for, whether
in gold Presley coats and sun
glasses or traditional scarlet,
the group clearly had a good
time, and. as is typical of Sear-
leteers performances, the aud—
ience did tool

The Quad’s counterpart to
the Scarleteers are the Tanagr
ers, a vocal group consisting
of nine girl singers. Dodi
Holcher, Donna Dagenais, Peg-
gy Ziegenhagen, Ruth Unruh,
and Becky Reetz, seniors; Mar-
cia James and Holly Hoebel,‘
juniors; Ginger Clark and
Cris Swanson, sophomores, are
the members of,tllis year's
group. ’

The Tanagers, who startedi
life long ago as the Debonairs,
are also not affiliated with
Grinnell College, although they
represent it indirectly as Grin-
nell Students, They perform at
various Oifvcampus engage-
ments, utilizing a music range.
from popular to barbershop.l
The group writes some of its
own music, and tries for a
balance of light and semi~ser-
ious numbers. Practices are
held on Tuesday nights at 6:30.
These were lleltl in Loose
Lounge until the arrival of the
T. V, set forced the Tanagers
to migrate to Fine Arts.

Budding Tanagers .may . try

 

their wings in the spring, when
the group holds its tryouts, it
now consists oi nine girls, but
that number will be cut to
eight next year, The ability to

read music. to blend well, and‘

chirp cheerfully is required.
The Tanagers do hot lay too

.great a stress on stage pres the bird

ence, as the group sings main-
ly for fun, and showmanship

 

 

 

 

lis acquired through experience.
Marcia James, as the group
leader, arranges the group’s
performances, sets rehearsal
times, and decides on the final
selection of the music.

As in the case of the Scar-
leteei‘s, the Tanagers are in
the group because they enjoy
lsinging and giving perform-
lances. Most of the group, Miss
[James feels, will continue sing-
ring in various actiVlties after
‘they leave Grinnell. The name,
incidentally, is derived from
called the Scarlet
,Tanager, who, unlike Grinnell's
group, cannot sing a note,

5 Tonight the 1964-65 Grinnell college home basket—
ball season gets underway, and it could be one of the
tnost exciting ones ever. The team has already played
two games on the road, losing to Augustana 79-66 and
gefeating pre-season Midwest Conference title favorite
. orn‘ell 99-82. 7

The emphasis this year will be on speed and con-
ditioning as there is very little height. At 6‘5”, sopho-
more center Jim Rhodes is the only man on the squad
over 6’3”, However, Augustana and Cornell are two of
the biggest, and supposedly best, teams that we will
face all year, and the Pioneers seem to have held their
Own. Also, a withering man to man press kept the Cor-
nell giants off-balance all night.

An interesting sidelight at Cornell occurred be-
fore the game when Ram coach Paul Maaske led his
mooses onto the court and needled Coach Pfitsch with
in hearing distance of most of our players, “I hate to
say it in front of your boys coach, but you’ve got a
bunch of runts here.” Coach Pfitsch, never at a lossfor
words, was not heard, but must have said something to
the effect of, “You're a real card Paul a you need to
be dealt with”; at which Pfitsch‘s team did
just that, leaving Maaske, I am sure, somewhat be-
wildered. All of this goes to show, I guess, that it’s a
620 over a 570 on those SAT‘s rather than brawn which
matters in basketball, Anyway, it was a tremendous ef-
fort on a hot night (Grinnell shot 61% from the floor
‘and 82% from the foul line), and the only crimeﬁis that
more Grinnellians weren’t able to see it,

From,Northfield, the word is that chief academic
rival Carleton thinks they have a very fine basketball
team, but they said the same thing about their foot-
ball team. Regardless, we are all anxiously awaiting
(or at least I am) their arrival so we can watch that
6’ 6" sophomore center from (of all places!) Crosby-
Ironton, Minnesota

Tonight we will be seeing the defending Confer-
ence champions in action, and although Jack Ankerson
and Gary Mevis have graduated Ripon still has Willie
Alexander, Jim Cahoon and Doug Ankerson, so it
should be a good show. Grinnell will counter with three
remarkably poised sophomores in Tom Hill, Elliott
Hibbs and Jim Rhodes, along with two juniors—Ted

Risser and Jeff Frantz. On the bench will be a lot of ex— ‘

perience in seniors Randy Morgan, Clyde Smith, Dave
’ Sellergren, Dick Ulrich and Toni Bucholtz plus Bob
Watt, another fine sophomore. I

It should be a good game and a good race for the
