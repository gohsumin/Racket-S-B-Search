Students Complete Independents
With Dramas by Albee and lonesco

By Ann Showalter

Juniors Deb Burnstine and Robin
Konikow will present their inde-
pendent drama projects, “The
'American Dream,” by Edward Al-
bee and “Jack or the Submission,"
by Eugene lonescu in the arena
theater Monday and Tuesday night.

Miss Burnstine described “The
'American Dream" as “ a comedy
with implications of horror."

She sees the play as the second
of three progressive steps in Al-
bee’s development as a playwright.
The first step is represented by
“The Sandbox" and the third by
"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.”

“The writing in ‘The Sandbox’ is
unpolished," she stated. “The char-
actors are abstract and unbeliev-
able and the impact of the play de-

pends heavily on a twisted mes-
sage at the end.

“There is more character de-
velopment in ‘American Dream’,"
she continued. “There is a con»
trast between the matter-of—iact
tone of what the characters say
and the abstract horror of the life
they are living. The way they live
reflects a certain view of Ameri-
can middle class mores."

' " ‘Virginia Woolf‘ is far more
polished in style and character de«
velopment than the first two plays.
Albee thrusts us into a real sit-
uation and within this situation the
dialogue seems apt and realistic.
What was begun in ‘The American
Dream' is carried one step fur-
ther."

The members of the cast for
"The American Dream” are Mike
Arnow as Daddy; Mike Dewitt, the
Young Man: l-lelen Klein, Mommy,
Lucia Lynner, Mrs. Barker and
Ruth Unruh, Grandma.

Miss Burnstine may take her
cast on tour next semester. She
hopes to present “The American
Dream” and “The Ugly Duckling.”
a fairy story by A. A. Milne, at
several colleges in the area.

Whereas Miss Burnstine feels
“The American Dream" is "not
far out enough” to be considered a
representative of the Theater of
the Absurd, Konikow states that
“Jack or the Submission" is “a
vivid example” of this genre,

“I’m fascinated by lonesco’s con-
cept of the inefficiency of language
to say all that should be said,”
Robin commented. “This element
runs through all of Ionesco's plays,
‘The Bald Soprano’ in particular."

Mysterious about the plot or
theme of the play, Robin stated,
“lonesco calls it a “naturalistic
comedy."

The cast includes Robert Katz as

Robert Barrow, Father Jack; Mar-
gie Applebee, Mother Jack; Bill
Beeman, Grandfather Jack; Con-
nie Simon, Grandmother Jack;
Cathi Rogers, Roberta I and ii;

'Jacquell'ne R. Freeman

November I3, l964

Dear Jackie,

The room is very empty. The bamboo fishing
poles are still standing in the corner, but most of the
other things have been taken down. I remember when
We bought those fishing poles and carried those twelve
foot sticks down the street lunging into every object
in sight, knocking at third floor windows, and trying
tog jump and touch telephone wires, Then we bent
them so they’d fit under the ceiling and left them as
archways'. That was the first week, when decorating
our three cornered room was so important, What dif-
ferent ideas we had! We finally bought bamboo cur—
tains last month, but neither of us ever found that free
moment to dye the muslin orange so that we could line

the drapes. Two stubborn people 9 three pairs ofl

bamboo curtains leaning against a well.
I’m thinking about you‘now as the French girl,
‘ Nicole, the girl you became when “everything in the
world looked orange,” or “the air felt purple and
Wednesdayish.” Nicole seemed to come and go in be—
tween humanities papers of biology exams. Sometimes
she’d stay for days and we’d go for walks or bike rides
and talk about loneliness, or make believe worlds.

But it was with Jackie that I had most of my dis—
cussions. I remember before I went out one evening
how you told me that everyone must believe in him-
self and know that he is just as good as the next man.
‘And I know how you believed in yourself. Sometimes
this belief led us to disagreements, but then it also
patched things up because we both learned that to live
as one requires the strength and effort of two. Our
whole house lived this way since the second night of
school when we became‘ten sisters. Very few people
knew how we lived and I don’t know if many would
have understood it. There was a home, and a family,
and strength in oneness. That’s why you told‘me that
you vilere happier than you had ever been before and
that’s why I agreed and so did we all.

Let the best be for your friends

Seek them with hours to live

For life alone is sleep without dreams
And life with one is whole.

Let the best be for your friends

And in them find the world

For each man mirrors all of mankind
But love makes friends unique. 7'

That is part of the song that Mimi and I were
working on. You never really did get to hear it though
I know you heard me picking out the melody. I remem-
ber once hearing you hum it though you didn’t know
what it was, Though it isn’t a hall song it describes
the development of the relationship of our White
House family: single individuals molded into a group,
developing into a bond of unique individuals.

You had trouble doing things on time, whether it
was finishing papers or getting in by Freshman hours.
I never did understand how you got in forty minutes
late one night when your watch had the right time. I
guess that was just part of you though. When you en—
joyed something or liked someone, time or place meant
nothing. Nothing could persuade you not to go some-

Harvard Theological Dean Speaks
On Metaphors, Faulkner, Clowns

By Lynn Denzler

Changing Metaphor

Dr. Samuel H. Miller opened this
year’s Gates Lecture Series by
speaking Sunday nighl on “The

‘ Mystery of the Changing Meta-

phor." He explained his topic as an
attempt “to show the way in which

, the changing metaphors Df the his-

torical epochs of the west portray
the nature or reality as it has shiic
ed in the mind and heart of man."

Presenting the first of three ad-
dresses un the “Images of Faith,"
the Dean at Harvard University‘s
Divinity School told his audience of
faculty and students that reality is
not directly describable.

“It is necessary to see reality
from the indirect methods of meta-
phor," he said.

In relating his Views on the na-
ture of man today, Dean Miller
stated that he felt that contempur-
ary man has lost his inwardness
and had lost all sense of transcen-
deuce.

Speaking to the first point he
said, “Man has been extemalized
— there is no longer any inner
core; he has been absorbed by his
world.“

“Man cannot get his finger on
the ultimate realities, on what we
would call God,” he said referring
to the lack of transcendence. “It is
from these realities that all lnean~
ing results.”

Dean Miller, who is a respected
leader in literature and the arts
as well as in theology, used both
ancient and contemporary artists
to illustrate his topic. Discussir‘ig
the eplc, he constrasted the Odys-
sey and the luiei-uo.

“ll'l Homer’s work," he said, "the
hero doesn't change at all over
the years oi hls journey. It is all
geographical: But Dame presents
an entirely different vision of the
universe. His epic is permeated
with Christian redemption — the
purpose or the Universe 15 to re
deem men."

Turning to Goethe and James

 

Joyce, lle slated that Faust was an
individual who emerged from the
Renaissance attempting to fulfill
himself, and the story of Joyce’s
The Traveler concerned "one
man’s attempt to find out What it
is to be a man.”

The Biblical metaphor that God
made men and the New Testament
metaphor that Christ redeemed
man to be a child of God are part
of what Dr. Miller termed the
“central reality."

“Metaphor is the oblique means
of getting a! the meaning of real-
ity,” he said. He went on to ex»
plain that nothing is selﬂsufficient
to itself and that “in the human
realm, there are no merely ob-
jective events."

At various points in his lecture,
Dean Miller termed reality "dy-
namic," “complex," and "inces-
santly moving” and said that there
is no final way to fix it.

Man today, according to Dr. Mil-
ler, is not metamorphically admit-
therefore he resorts to fiction.
“Both religion and fiction strive to
celebrate the truth they lihd in dra-
matic terms — as life," he con~
tinued. .

Dr. Miller used the term “plural-
ism" to deflne the dilemma of man
today, who sees so much of the
technical and specialism of life. He
referred to such a position as
“nearer to schizophrenia."

“Almost all our World has been
factuallzed, and we are more and
more competent in rational de-
scription," he said.

“Science can afford to be pre»
cise, but lt is inadequate,“ he con-
tinued. “Science abstracts one fact
to describe ll. yet ignores all the
others."

Expanding the idea at central
reality and the modern specializa-
tion of man, he said that man has
the tendency to rebel 1“ this revo-
lutionary society. “But at the apex
of man in the rebel metaphor, he
is unable to sustain llis individuals
ity and falls down, Such it was with
the Nazi and the Fascist," he said.

This Is What We face in art and

 

 

place you really wanted to go. You were so easily ex-
cited and so easily satisfied that people were happy
when they were with you and you too were very
happy. No tomorrows held you back; living was busy
and full.

There were so many things we did, like trying to
figure out at 2:00 am. how to make paper mache for a
homecoming float, making up games for the kids at
Uncle Sam’s Club, painting light bulbs red, doing
crash exercises to get through that physical fitness
test, trying to hide Goldberg, the “damn cat” that was
also part of our family for a while, making caramel
apples, short sheeting people’s beds, sitting up all night
singing folk songs, planning surprise birthday parties,
putting on skits like the Freud farce last week when
Leslie made Phi Beta Kappa, or the one for our “Stop
the World” houseparty, and arguing over who gets to
do Dar’s French homework. ‘

Soon I'll go into the room and notice how every—
thing is gone, the drawing of the plump bunny, your
trolls, the Peanut’s calendar, the cigar box stuffed
with letters, the yellow headed moccasins, and your
little red pillow, everything that was you. No, not
everything — part of you is me.

Love, Bobbi

mate of Jacqueline Freeman.

 

literature today according to Dr.
Miller. "The human image is being
tortured and threatened — the
artists are shouting at us — Why?
Because there is a possibility that
man may lose his humanity.“

But, said Dean Miller, we have
authors who are trying to rediscuv~
er that humanity in the novel and
the drama. He listed Camus, Kai
ka, Boll, and Arthur Miller here
and concluded.

“These are seeking to draw new
metaphors, for reality is always
elusive in light of which it Shall al-
ways be redeemed.“

Fiction, Faith
Faulkner

On Monday morning Deal-l Mll-
ler took his audience through an
examination of "The Fiction of
Faith in Faulkner." Mentioning
briefly the weakening of symbol in
religious realms that he had noted
so fully in his first lecture, the
theologian said that “it is no acci-
dent that faith has turned to fiction
"to attempt to reconstruct Its an-
swers."

He spoke of writers today who
have the urgency to penetrate the
order of symbol-less epoch naming
D. H. Lawrence's attempt to’ get
at reality through sex and the
“sports-heroic” of Ernest Heming-
way as examples;

“The nature or religious litera-
ture concerns a diligent search of
normal existence with some” evl<
dence of the transcendent reality
of God,” he said. ‘

He further termed the Works of
Lloyd c. Douglas and other seem-
ingly religious authors who only
present the external without under-
standing the internal as “rakery
of the worst sort."

Dean Miller then turned to the
work of modem American author,
William Faulkner as an example
a! “fiction as a large scale meta~
phor and thus a way of looking at
reality.” He placed particular em-
phasls On two of Faulkner’s novels,
Sound and the Fury and As I lay
Dying.

“Life abounds in Faulkner," he
said. “He works in such a compact
report. of human experience. He
has respect for existence and a wil-
lingness to see as much as can
be seen by the human worl .”

Miller sees the Work of Faulkner
rising from the religious decadence
of the south as u transposition of
the Calvinism characteristics of
impending judgment, a past and
inevitable late, and the will tn act
and endure.

“Faulkner sees life In its abso-
lute fitness, how it hangs together
with all of its outrages. tragedy,
and humor — caught in a frame
of Calvinistic lnevltableness," l'lI
said. "He is Working at the level
of experiences with Christian pm
cepts.”

Dr. Miller termed Sound Ind (ht
Fury a "novel of damnation," ser-
iously couceived, oi the profoundest
moral." He compared the tragedy
of this work to the journey through
hell creazed by ounce.

“Each person in this novel lie.
comes the others he“; each is
alienated from life in its fullest"

What could possibly be more
topical than a column on racial

solence, and pity seems 50, oh, run

the amazing success 0! Dick Greg-
ory and the recent trend toward

worked in my pregnant mind, Fi-
nally one day, looking at my sun-
glasses, "Shades at Gray" was
born. I would look at the great so-
cial revolution through my own
sunglasses,

True. my view is colored, it not
by my glasses, then by my own
particular situation. Contrary to
general opinion, i am not Grinnell

to speak {or any group or sub-
groups within American society—
l'm speaking lor myself. And per-
sonally i think that being Negro
is lun. Fun like being non-Catholic
in Inquisition Spain, and being
Jewish in Nazi Germany never
could have been. Being a Negro
in Mississippi has its times too,
but being Negro in the North is
an experience that does not hap-
pen everyday. Here it is the most
spectacular game ever played:
sometimes there are rules and
sometimes not. Regardless, the

 

Northern Negro is always sure at
winning. No matter what strategy

Tromly, Schorr View ‘Oedipus Rex’

By Fred Tromly
Mark Schorr

Last weekend Roberts Thea-
tre became the Greek amphi—
theatre it was built to be, Un-
der the direction of Professor
Meyer (Speech and Theatre)
the Grinnell College Theatre
presented Sophocles' ”Oedipus
Rex” (“King Fatfeet”),

The stark simplicity of the
stage, With its three columns
and two raised platforms, pro-
vided an effective «contrast to
the ritualistic emotion of the
chorus and the horror of Oedi-
pus' lall. The tension resulting
from this contrast began with
the entrance of the chorus and

created an atmosphere suitable
to the downfall of great per-
sons from high places,

To the credit ot the princi-
pals, Margaret Weathers (Jo-
casta) and Walter Lowe (Othel-
lo), (sic), their acting estab-
lished in dramatic perspective
which in turn functioned as the
tragic norm oi the drama.
Their restrained gestures and
precise articulation during the
development oi the action made
effective (through the contrast
in dramatic tension) the almost
unbearably heightened emotion
of the climax.

Capably supporting Weath-
ers and Lowe were Terry Mc-

Coy (Tiresias), Ric MacDDW<
ell (Priest), Maxwell Heligott
(Shepherd), and an admirably
co-ordinaled chorus under Mrs,
Voertman, of chorus.

Special note should be given
to Charles Burns (Palace Olfi<
cial) whose role of recounting
the death of Jocasta and the
blinding or Oedipus constituted
some of the most diillcult act<
mg of the play

This production of “Oedipus
Rex" was a courageous attempt
to recreate Greek drama with
out adopting expedient halL
way measures. Unlike most
complex edifices this produc<
tion had its foundation in the
Attic.

 

Concert Series Purpose Explained by Prof. Jones:
EdUCalion Tops Entertainment in Program Goals

By Susan Taylor

“I View the Grinnell College
Concert Series as an education-
al process Mr students as well
as an entertainment event,"
Don Jones (music) chairman
of the Concert Series said. He
explained that the series seeks
to bring artists or a proiession-
al status to the Grinnell com-
munity throughout the year.

From the concert atmos-
phere, more of a “cultural"
event is to be provided by this
program which is sponsored by
the college from the regular
budget, It is administered by a
member of the music faculty
on a rotating basis, Jones has
been chairman for four years.

This year's program, which
is somewhat limited due to an
overall cut in the budget of the
college includes the Warsaw
Philharmonic Orchestra, which
the concert series sponsored in
cooperation with the Student
Concerts Committee, B l a k e
Stern, a tenor soloist perforlih
ing this weekend, a contempoiu
airy chamber music ensemble,
and a piano soloist.

By the varied program of pro-

 

iessional artists, the Concert
Series hopes that the members
of the college community, stu-
dent and faculty alike, may
learn from the benefit of good
music perrormed by reputable
artists here in Grinnell.

In nelecting the performers
for the year, the chairmanof
the series has the benefit of the
knowledge of the entire music
department iaculty. and or their
contacts in New York. He also
makes use of reviews and oth-
er printed material. But he
always keeps in mind the edu-
cational purpose or the series.

Jones cited the ”impact
which the Lenox String Quar-
tet has made on a fairly large
segment of the students and
faculty" as an example of the
kind of educational value the
concert series has. Though the
Lenox concerts are not form-
ally a part of the Concert See
ries program, many studenls
and faculty members have
learned a great deal about this
medium of artistic expression
by attending their performe
ances.

Roberts Theatre, .though it

 

provides a small and formal
concert atmosphere, is really
an asset to the performing mu<
siciau, Jones explained, be<
cause of his excellent acoustics
He explained that having these
concerts in Darby Gymnasium
would be defeating their pur-
pose, becausc the sound cannot
be received in its true form by
the listener.

Other problems oi the series
include the ever-present dole
lurs and cents, “To have a bal-
anced program just costs more
than we can allord," Jones
said. He said that the College
should have a professional pelu
lormance in drama and dance
as well as musical events each
year.

The Concert Series sponsors
some events with the Student
Concert Committeeilhe two
groups sharing the cost of the
evenl. However, most of the
purely popular entertainment
events are handled exclusively
by the student committee, leavA
ing the more educational and

$l700 Scholarships
Offered by K. Gibbs‘

Two national scholarships iot-
college senior girls are offered for:
1965-1966 by the Katharine Gibbs
School. These awards were estab-
lished in 1935 as a memorial to
Mrs. Katharine Gibbs, founder
and Iirst president or the school.

Each scholarship consists of lull
tuition ($1,200) tor the secretarial
tramlng course, plus an additionali
cash award of $500 [otallng $1,700,
The winners may select any one
of the tour Gibbs schools for their
trainingiBoston, New York, Mout-
tlall‘, or Providence.

Winners are chosen by the Schol-
Il'slllp Committee on the basis of.‘
college academic record, personal
and character qualilications, finan-
cial need, and potentialities for
success in business.

Each college or university may:
recommend two candidates, andl
each candidate must have this on}
ﬁcial endorsement. Students who)
may be interested in competing for]
one of these Katharine Gibbs;
awards may obtain iull intormation i
from llle college placement bureau.

 

Members. of the committee
are: Donna Dagenals, Peggy
Gerber, Anne Hoganson. Joan
Lovejoy, Daria Fredericks,
Larinda Yeisley, Janice Linnell,
Christina Swanson, Ellen Det-
ertng and lrene Blaser.

They will work on two pro-
jects. The llrst will be an at-
tempt to simplify the forms
presently used when women
students leave town and return.
It is hoped that this will facili-
tate the use of the forms so
that all women will be accur-
ately signed out when they
leave. Sign-out forms are used
mainly so that contact with the
student can be made easily in
case or an emergency,

The second project will be
the possibility or an over-all

parental permission form to be
maintained on tile for each stu-
dentl This would eliminate the
need for express written per
mission from the woman’s par-
ents each time she wishes to
visit off campus

The committee will use in-
formation gathered by a simi-
lar group last spring. and also
has many examples of the
forms used at other colleges.
Miss Young explained when a
plan is established, it will be
submitted for Senate approval.
Appropriate handbook changes
would then be made and the
plan put into use. This will most
likely not be ﬁnished until
spring, so that the plan would,
be in use leginning in Septemr
her next yrar.

thsitations Penalty
Explored by C of HP

The penalty range for illegal
visitations was discussed at the
last CotHP meeting Thursday,
November 12.

Because there have been no
recent cases of this type
brought to the student courts
and there are no specific penal-
ties in the handbook, the CofHP
and the courts were faced with
a dilemma recently when two
apprehensions were made by

‘ Coil-1P members.

Upon request of the“ chief
magistrate oi the men's pri-
mary court, the Coil-IF dis-
cussed recommended fines and
suggested a first offense pen<
alty range of $10 to recom-
mended suspension in cases of
illegal visitations.

“We wanted a penalty that
would not make house presi<
dents reluctant to apprehend
people in cases of this type,"
said CofHP President Pete
Read.

He pointed out, that recom-
mended suspension cases are
no longer handled by the stu<
dent deans but go directly to

the Faculty Committee on Stu-,

dent Affairs. In case the courts
recommend conduct probation,

however, the cases will be hang

died by the deans,

The men’s and women's pri-
mary courts will meet jointly
this Sunday to try the cases of
illegal visitations. If- the fines
suggested by the COiHP are
upheld, Read will move to have
these penalties be made per-

Biologists Obtain
Better Specimens
In Colder Weather

Dr. Kenneth A. Christiansen,
'(aiu), reports that previous dif-
ficulties his department has had
in obtaining live specimens of vari-
ous marine animals has lessened
greatly with the arrival of cooler
weather. One shipment of animals
sent from the East coast in mid-
summer was largely dead on ar-
rival, due to their exposure to
summer heat in transit. Another
sent in early autumn from the
Ward Biological Supply in Calia
lornia contained many dead speci-
mens. Christiansen noted that Grim
nell’s distance from both the East
and West Coast cause great dilii—
culties in stocking its new marine
aquarium obtained through the Na-
tional Science Foundation. and
used extensively by students in in-
vertebrate Zoology.

A typical shipment at such ani-
mals costs between twentyend
thirty dollars and includes star-
fish, sea urchins, coral, marine
snails and clams, sand dollars and
sea anenomes. Christiansen speci-
fied clams as the most rugged of
all the marine animals used, able
to withstand summer and early
fall heat, and live shrimp, sponges
and colonial coelenterates those
specimens least able to survive

- transportation conditions. Although
the marine aquarium allows ex-
tensive experimentation with live
specimens by‘zoology students,
preserved specimens are still wide»

Quartet Premiere

by Luciano Berio

To Be in Roberts Wednesday Night

Roberts Theatre will be the
scene of the world premiere
of a new work by the eminent
Italian composer Luciano Be-
rlo on Wednesday, November
25, at 8:00 p.m.

Borio, himself, will fly to
Iowa for the first performance
of his ”Sincronie, for String
Quartet," which was commis—
sioned by the college for per-
formance by the Lenox group,
Grinnell’s quartet-inrresidence.

The “Sincronie” will, as cus—
tot-nary with premieres, be
played twice, at the beginning
and end of the program. Claude
Debussy’s “String Quartet"
will be presented between the
two presentations of the new
work.

claim in both Europe and the

Argonne Applicants
Still Being Sought

Only one application for the
1965 Argonne Semester pro—
gram has been submitted from
Grinnell, according to LaVerne
Durkee, (biology) advisor for
the program.

Durkee said, however, that
applications may still be made
for the September 7—December
23 period even though the dead~
line was November 15. The first
period of the 1565 program
will be March 22-July 9; one
biology major has applied for
this time.

“Grinnell biology students
can fit the Argonne semester
into their schedule more eas»
ily than chemistry or physics
majors because of the many
required courses in the physi-
cal sciences," Durkee noted.
“Nonetheless, among the nine
other Associated Colleges of
the Midwest which participates
in this program, biology stu-
dents are the hardest to get.

The purpose of the Argonne
Semester is to complement the
liberal arts program by pro-
viding to science majors a
unique opportunity lor ad
vanced study in a research en-
vironment and laboratory eXr
perience as coworkers with
leading scientists.

Because of conflicting sched-
ules “among the participating
colleges the program is now
designed to last six months—7
four month instructional period
during which students divide
their time between a paid rer
search assignment and aca-
demic work, and two months
as a full-time paid student aide.
The student aide work can be
done‘ before and/or after the
instructional period, depending
on the student‘s college sched-
ule.

Student participating in the
Argonne semester pay the reg—
ular tuition to their home col-
lege. Housing at Argonne is
available in guest facilities on
the laboratory site or at nearby
institutions Regular college
vacations do not apply to stu-
dents in this program,

Grinnell’s participant in the
spring 1964 session was Mar-i

major,

United States, Berio’s works
include many compositions for
various traditional musical me-
dia, and he has also been ac-
tive in electronic music.

Called “one o! the most re»
freshing and provocative com-
posers to emerge from postwar
Italy," Luciano Berio is a com-
poser-teacher who divides his
time between the Studio of Ra-
diotelevisione ltaliana in Milan
and Mills Collage in California.
He studied with Paribeni and
Ghedini at the Milan Conserva-
tory and later with Dallapid
cola at Tanglewood under a
Koussevitsky Foundation schol-
arship,

‘Of his new “Sincronie” he
writes, “I was interested in
using the string quartet not es«
pecially as a polyphonic en-
semble, but rather as a single,
homophonic instrument. The
four participants elaborate the
same sequence of harmonic
blocs almost continuously, sim-
ultaneously ‘saying’ the same
thing in different ways.”

Members of the Lenox Quar-
tet, now in their third season
as artists-in-residence at Grin-
nell, are Peter Marsh and
Theodora Mantz, violins; Paul
Hersh, viola; and Donald Mc-
Call, cello. The focus of their
activity on campus is on cham-
ber music through teaching and
performing.

The quartet is currently in
New York rehearsing with Be-
rio.

Formed while its members
were performing as Fromm
Players at the Berkshire Music
Center, Tanglewood, Mass, the
group has become widely
known for its concerts at the

From the Past .

Forty-five years is a long time in the history of a college
as well as anywhere ‘else 1919 seems to be a very great dis-
tance in the past, remote from our modern world and the
Grinnell College of the PPPE, the Civil Rights Group, and
tshe Forum. Was it really so different, though? A look at the

8&B’s published 1n the first semester of the 1919-1920 school
year reveals some interesting differences, and some astonish-
ing similarities.

This was just after a world war, and the boy- girl ratio
was still upset by the number of Grinnell men who served in
the armed forces But the men who did live on North Campus
in that far- off year returned to school under a new residence
system described as follows: “There will be faculty men re-
siding in the suites formerly known as the house chairman's
suites, but they will have no responsibility for the conduct of
the men in the dormitory and are in the dormitories only for
the friendly association with the students . , . ." And, from
one of the new residents,” My only desire is to serve as a
means of communication between the men and the administra-
tion, to develop such plans of government as the men believe
Will maintain the high standards of the Grinnell college . . . .
they (the men) can be trusted to develop for themselves ideals
and traditions which will make life in the dormitories a dis-
tinct good.”

This was the era of daily chapel meetings, except during
the flu epidemic and the diptheria scare, Freshmen were re-
quired to attend several “Freshman College Adjustment
classes,” and all students were required to attend class meet-

sented”.. .the best record in the observance of house regula-
tions . In orde1 to fostei community spirit in its broadest
sense . . .to reward the girls who strive with the Community
Aim in view." But prepping, including an enforced serenade
in pajamas, ahounded, and there was even a Flunk Day. And
social life, too Note the paid advertisement which appeared
in an October issue: “All engaged girls are requested to wear
insignia of such, as diamond (or) frat pin. .in order that a
more accurate census may be made. —- Ex- service Man”

Problems such as the League of Nations petition, Red
Cross Drives and a 3-inillion- dollar endowment fund drives,
received publicity in the pages of the 5&3, already in its
27th season. B&G problems were there, too: “When you can’t
turn the faucet off in your room, and you haven’t any rug on
the floor, and the lights are on the blink —- two blinks, in
fact — and the drinking fountain is broken, and the gas
leaks in the kitchenette, and the iron won’t heat, and your
alarm clock goes back on you so that you are late for your
eight o’clock —_oh, cheer up . . .” (Consolations include sec-
onds on butter, roomcleaning service, and mail delivery to
the student’s room. What consoles us?)

Grinnell-in-China, a fore-runner of the present 5th Year
Abroad program, and the exchange with Anatolia College in
Greece, now a pan of the same plan, were both going strong
in 1919 So was a person familiar to every present Grinnellian,
as proved by the following letterl “If nominations to the Hall
of Flame are in order, might 1 not propose that Nonessential
Citizen, that Walking Big Ben which locks the animals in
the Quad? And might I not say of him, as Uncle Sammie ,far
more falsely says of his mail carriers: ‘Neither snow nor rain
nor heat nor gloom of night stop this courier from the swift
completion of his appointed round!’ — N.H,S.” ——

Between studies, religious activities, and fun came an-
other omnipresent aspect of college life —— the Student Coun-

' cil. Shades of the 1960’s these quotes from the first editorial
on the subject in January of 1920. “. . . we at Grinnell see
the college body of which we are each a part afflicted with
a member which is fullyas grotesque and as useless as legs
on a fish or fins on a horse, The member passes under the
name of Student Council . . . in the past four years at least
the body has lain in a stupor awaiting the death which so far
has not come. Its duties during that time' have consisted, so
far as anybody knows, of’apportioning the semester fee and
directing the college dances , . . , The reason for the failure of
the Council probably lies either in the indifference of the
students, the negligence of the faculty in granting sufficient
power to the Council or the inefficiency of the Council itself.

One last article, not because“ it proves anything at all, but
just for the fun of it. I swear to its authenticity. The head-
line reads “Red Lights Remind Noise Makers to Use Soft
Peddles." The article, in its entirety, tells: “The Quadrangle
loggia has recently brought forth a crop of beautiful red
lights, It is rumored that their purpose is to remind the girls
of the necessary pianissimo,

”0f couise, the more poetic girls, when they start up the
loggia, shivering, to breakfast, say that the rosy glow makes

whatever you think of, the fact remains that in front of each

Grinnell In ﬁrst Game West

Seventy- -iive years ago _ on Nov
16,1889 — gridiron gladiators rape
resenting Grinnell College and the
State University of Iowa met in the
lirst intercollegiate football game
played west oi the Mississippi Riv-
er.

Grliinell, then known as Iowa
College oi Grinnell, won the game

up. It was played on the Grinnell .

campus north of the present Burl-
lng Lihrary and Fine Arts Center

The game grew out or an Octo-
her, 1889, challenge circulated by
SUI in two newspapers. it read:

“The State University ‘iooiball
team hereby challenges any Cole
legs or other team in the state to
a game of ioothall. American AS»
socialion Rules.”

Though the sport was tamiliai- to
only a iew Grinnellians, the Chal-
lenge was accepted, a team ivas
organized with F. L. (Lou) Van
Gieson as Captain, and a hall was
sent for.

Van Gieson and Frank F. Ever-
est were the main organizers. They
had played ioothall the previous
year while attending prep school
in New Jersey.

Game day — a raw late tall day
— arrived, and the SUI team was
accompanied to Grinnell by a
throng oi Iowa City partisans who
came “just to teach you boys how
to play the game” and to "see
their team bag a tow cornlield
canaries."

An old report tells that the SUI
players were “fairly radiant in un-
spotted suits oi white canvas." The
Grinnellians presented a much dif~
ferent appearance. They were a
rag-tag looking aggregation attired
in Duliiis of all sizes, shapes; and
colors. Only two had regulation
iootball pants. The others ware
sweaters, gym jerseys, last sum-
mer’s outing shirts, and- bicycle
pantsr one even were “ll pair of
genuine blue jean overalls."

Van Gieson’s “serpentine suit,”
along with his “bird-like hops,” re-
portedly frightened the SUI rush
line in the first half.

Even more lrightening to SUI
was _Grinneil's ﬂying wedge of-
fense. This formation was later for
hidden because it was so danger—
ous.

Game reports also tell how the

A replay was inimedlntely'sclled
uled for Iowa City for Nov , but
was cancelled because of the late-
ness of the date.

The leplay came about the next
year with Grinneil again winning,
1476. The roughness of the action
is related in this liltid account,
which tells about SUl's tollchdow ‘

"Pooley loses twice on good rush

by Powers, probably accidentally.
Blood ilows lreely. Miller gets the
ball somehow, kicks [on low and
the hall is knocked into Sampson's
face. Lyon about to down Sampson,

is himself knocked down by a blow l

in the breast, which-the umpire

clear ﬁeld makes a touch-down.”
There was a strong disposition
on the part oi the Grinnell team to
ﬁnd fault with Sampson for his
roughness, but when it was learned
that he was prolessor or English
literature at the university, the
matter was quickly droppedr
Giinnell also played the Univer-
sity of Minnesota at Minneapolis

14 2 with ten minutes leit. This was
the ﬁrst interstate football game
played in the West.

Grinneli made it three wins in a
row over SUI with a 674 victory in
1391 and twice met Minnesota,
gaining a 12112 tie here but losing
22—14 at Minneapolis. Five times
touring the 12—12 knot with Minne-
isota, Arthur Cowden stole the bail

yaids ior touchdowns aitei steals,
‘but the reieree allowed only one oi
them.

. The St, Paul Pioneerrl’l'ess said
this about Grinnell’s diieiise in the
game in Minnesota:

“Braced behind their ‘snappei

nell) would go crashing through the
University center like a battering

Football has continued as a part
oi Grinnell’s athletic program to
this day. Only in the war years of
1943 and 1944 did Grinnell tail in

The Grinnell Pioneers ended
‘ the 1964 season with an impres-
sive 28710 victory over the
Lions of St, Olaf. Led by four
teen seniors, Coach Bowers'
professional Pioneer team
clinched a fourth place tie with
Beloit,

The Grinnell offense scored a
season high of 21 points by the
running of John Shierholz,
Marty Ringo, and Elston Bow—
ers. Whenever the running

and pulled out the football,
,Then he proceeded to complete

asses to star ends Mike De»

ltt, Al Peterson, and Dave

All in all, the season proved
successful. This writer feels
that the team could have fin-
ished higher if they only had
played consistently. The two-
platoon system proved effec-
§ive with the defense and of-
ense both rating high in these
two departments.

Prospects for next year look
good with an outstanding fresh-
men team and seasoned veter-
ans led by co-captains elect
John Shierholz and Paul Thur-
ston. The only question mark
is can a successful small-cob
lege coach continue to recruit
75% of his ballplayers from the
Iowa-Illinois area constituting
only 50% of the Grinnell en-
rollment. This writer feels that
if Coach Bowers can, .Grinnell
will be a conference winner in
the near future.

Coach Depends on Veteran Swimmers
Three Sophs to Help Carry the Load

Given a chance to climb back
to the Midwest Conference throne
room after a 3»year lapse, Coach
lrv Simone will be depending on
four veterans and three sopllo~
mores to carry most of the load
for his swimming team.

The four lettermen H Tony Hor-
ton, John Kraai, Ralph Pray, and
Howard Schein — had a hand in all
3 points Grinnell notched on the
way In a fourth place spot in the
1964 loop meet,

Kraai, set a new Grinnell record
of 2:313 in the 200yard breast-
stroke a year ago and came in sec~
and in that event in the league
meet. He also swam on Grinnell's
second place Myard medley relay
foursome and was a consistent
high placer in the individual med-
fey event.

The team's distance ace, Pray,
came in second in the myard
freestyle and fourth in the 500-
yard freestyle at the conference
meet and also swam on Grinnell's
third place dooyard freestyle re-
lay team He won the two distance
events 17 of 20 times in dual meet
action.

 

Schein was always a high finisher
in 50-, 60-, and lanyard freestyle
events and came in fourth in the
100 at the league meet. He an-
chored the freestyle relay four-
some,

Horton specializes in the back
stroke and was beaten only three
times in 10 dual meet triesi He
placed fourth in the conference
race and also swam on the free-
style and medley foursomes

Other lettermen on the squad are
Roger Abendroth, a diver, and
Eric Jacobson, butterfly. They
picked up valuable points in their
specialties during the 196364 cam-
palgn.

Top sophomore prospects are
Ken Adelman, Richard Lance and
Charles Schnell.

The younger brother of if fore
mar Pioneer Star who still holds
several records, Adelman set a
new conference fresh mark in the
zoo-yard butterfly. _

Schnell will give Grinnell excel-
lent depth in distance events and
the backstroke. He wrote a new
loop freshman mark in the 500‘
yard freestyle.

Football Team Finishes its Season
Seniors End Their Playing Career

.rini Ramsey

A cursory glance at the Pio-
neer’s 573 finish would indi-
cate a somewhat - less » than
spectacular season; but a more
exact analysis reveals that the
record alone does not imply the
team’s true strength. This cone
clusion, although among the ra»
tionalizations of any season
postmortem, is borne out sulr
stantially by statistics. While
finishing in a 4th place tie With
Beloit in conference standing,
the Pioneers ranked 2nd in to-
tal defense, allowing opponents
an average 179 yards and lo
points a game, and 3rd in total
offense,

The Pioneer’s long suit lay in
an experienced and determined
defensive team, While the team
was primarily the same one
which a year ago proved such a
vital weakspot, especially in
pass defense, an added year of
eitperience and the coaching of
Gene chert molded it into
one of the league’s toughest
units, shuting their opponents
out in half the games. After a
first game defeat to Ripon, and
later losses to Eeloit and Coe,
the pride and determination of
the Pioneer defense was instru»
mental in recovery and subse-
quent victories.

The offensive attack, scor<
ing at least two touchdowns in
every game, was extremely
well-balanced, While a substan-
tial majority of total yardage
was gained on the ground. The
unique feature of this attack
rests in the fact that no Grinr
nell player was among the
league's top ten scorers, in
spite of our 3rd place ranking
in total offensive yardage: The

fact that opposing defenses
keyed their forces primarily
against halfback Elston Bow-
ers, leading team scorer and
rusher for two seasons, enabl-
ing other backs to shake loose,
may partially explain this con»
tradiction; but. more»so it illus-
trates the united team effort
which supported such a produc-
tive attack.

Individual recognition on
such an evenly balanced Pio-
neer squad would have to in-
clude a good majority of the
team. No one player or group
of players can fairly be given
credit for either the offensive
or defensive strength: a sec-
and ranked defense, a remark-
ably even distribution of scor-
ing among the offensive backs,
and 6 out of 7‘0ffensive linemen
receiving recognition in the
Des Moines Register's list of
outstanding Iowa linemen all
give clear evidence to the fact
that total team effort and de-
termination wera responsible
for a successful season,

With 14 seniors on this year’s
small squad, the Pioneer future
would at first glance appear
dim. But several factors may
shed some optimism on next
year’s forecast, First, with a
freely substituting tWOVplatocn
system, many juniors and
sophomores gained valuable
experience this year, Secondly,
the freshmen squad, boasting a
243-1 record may adequately
fill many of the gaps left by
gradaliting seniors. Finally,
Tom Lannom, varsity defensive
linebacker and offensive Cen-
ter, may receive another year
of eligibility, which would lend
both strength and experience on
next year's team.

Page Eleven

 

By Paul Trigg

 

The repercussions from my effort last week have
induced me to return to predicting game scores for a
while. Seriously, there has been enough agitation to
warrant a curtain call, but I would rather wait until all
the ballots are in before hopping back up on the shoot~
lng gallery. So, without lingering longer, let me launch
into asubject a little less controversial (I hope).

The 1964 Midwest, Conference football season is
over and Grinnell finished in a respectable tie for
fourth with Beloit, behind co-champions Cornell, Ripon

and Coe. More luster was added to our finish by last
week's impressive 28‘10 victory over St. Olaf to close
out the season Fourteen seniors played their last game
and they are to be congratulated for in three years of
varsity competition they played to a record of 17 wins,
8 losses and 1 tie. This is especially outstanding con-
aidering they were playing before a school which, for
the most part, is passive toward athletics But that is
, another subject which I would rather not get into right
nowi Regardless, I congratulate, as should the entire
school, these seniors and the football team for a good

season.

Having received a few gibes for lack of fortitude
in making predictions, thus accounting for my perfect
record this fall (95 right, 0 wrong and 1 tie); I reply

this week by placing my head on the guillotine. First.
Michigan 26 Ohio State 21 and a trip to the Rose Bowl
for the Wolverines. Secondly, and may the Lord help
me, Iowa 22 Notre Dame 21 in the upset of the year.
With this comes the end of the football season.

Next week — back to more serious matters.

 

End of Mifflin-Sundell Era al Grinnell
Coach Faces Big Rebuilding Tasll Now

The Mifflin-Sundell basket-
ball era has ended and Coach
John Piitsch faces a big re-
building task this year. ‘

Jim Milflin and John Sun-
dell, both 3«year stars and all-
conference performers, were
the only graduation losses, but
they formed the hem of last
year‘s team. accounting for 50
per cent of the rebounds and
Al per cent of the points.

Both wrote their names prom-
inently in Grinnell’s record
book. A 6-7 center, Sundell set
single game (sl), season (443),
and career (1031) rebounding
marks. Mifﬂin, a 6-4 forward,
tossed in 438 points last winter
to tie the school career stand
lard of 1101 Their departure
leaves Pfitsch with What will
probably be the Midwest Con-
ference’s shortest team.

Tallest man on the squad is
6.5 sophomore Jim Rhodes, the
probable starting center. But, he
broke his collar bone in an in-
tramural football mishap and
isn’t expected to be ready un~
til after the Christmas break.

Pfitsch has seven returning
lettermen, but only'lhree of
them—senior Clyde Smith, and
juniors Jeff Frantz and Ted
Risser, are in the 672 and over
class.

Frantzp who Piitsch says
"Could he the best basketball
player l've ever had,” set a
sophomore scoring record of

 

391 points in 1963-64 for an av-
erage of 17.8 per outing. The
most consistent scorer during
the second half of the cam»
paign, he averaged 23.6 points
for the last 10 games.

A deadly outshooter and
hard driver, Frantl is most at
home at guard. But Pﬁtsch
may have to move him to for-
ward because of his rebound-
ing skills. He ranked second to
Sundell in that department last
year.

Smith was a starting forward
in 1963-64 and averaged 6.8
points and pulled .down 98 re-‘
bounds. Kisser lettered as a
reserve forward.

The third returning starter is
510 guard Dave Sellergl‘en. A
2-year veteran his main forte
in his floor play. He averaged
4,7 points per game last sea-
son. Tom Buchholtz, Randy
Morgan, and Dick Ulrich are
the other lettel'men.

Top sophomore prospect is
Elliott Hibbs. A 6-0 guard and
another fine outshooter, he
paced last winter's lrosh team
with n 23»point average.

Other sophomores who are
given a theme to break into
the first unit are Steve Brint-
nail, Tom Hill, Dick Lovell, and
Bob Walt. None top 6-1.

Pfitscli's ﬁrst unit may in-
clude 10 Pioneers rather than
the usual {we or six. Because
of its lack oi size, Grinnell Will

lorry Miller leads

Coach Edd Bowers has only l0

Grinnell Pioneer wrestling team,

but seven of them were regulars
0n the 196364 nuifit that posted a

lerence meet.

“We could have as good a team
as last year it we don’t have any
injuries and it a couple of our
sophomores come through," Bow-
ers stated But it appears unlikely
that the Pioneers will be able to
match last year's record as Cor-
hell and State College of Iowa have
been added to the dual meet sched-
ule. Both are perennial powers and
Cornell is expected to retain its
lnop crown,

Leading Grinnell {or the third
straight year will be Captain Larry
Miller. Miller, who combines
strength, savy, and a great com-
petitive spirit, has lost only once
in 26 matches during his Pioneer
career. That was early in his soph-
omore year. Since then, he has
copped 24 straight ‘matohes and
twice won the conference 167-pcund
crown.

Miller injured a leg in Grinnell’s
opening football game and sat out
the rest of the season, but should
be ready to go at full speed by the
opening wrestling meet.

Barnes and Sirubler, a pair of
tough little guys, will till the 123-

Strubler posted a l4—3-l mark a

Lewis is tabbed for the 177-pnund
pOSition, but may be slowed at first
by shoulder injuries he received in
football. He Won 11 of 16 matches
in 196364 and placed second in
the conference. Sophomore Eob

Continued from page 2

as the novel projects a radical im-
age of “man against the wall of
life.”

Ha proceeded to examine each of
the principle characters in, the
book, calling Jason, “one of the
ugliest people I‘ve ever met in fic-
tion," and applauding the Negro
maid Dilcey as the symbol of
“goodness and grace—the suffering
'servant."

“Only Dilcey understands and
endures," he continued crediting
her peace to her faith in an eternal
order. “She alone is whole and
healthy -— characteristics which
are a manifestation of her faith
and religion," he said.

As 1 Lay Dying he lauded as
Faulkner's “warmest, kindliest,
and most affectionate novel." Ex»
amining the plot which involves
the combined efforts of a family
to bury its mother according to her
wishes, he termed it “the height
of moral seriousness. Here the
tragic and humerous mingle and
the sublime and folkish come to
gether. The overall motive pushes
the action along."

Concluding his remarks by ap-
plying them to the dilemma of
modern man, Dean Miller said,
“We find it difficult to identify the
principles of realities in religion.
There seems to be no relevance to
the run of the mill existence."

As in the faith of fiction in
Faulkner, he stressed that the fun-
damental task of religion was “to
pay attention to life, not self."

“Religion at best is not con-

 

cerned with religion," he said. “it
is concerned with the clarification
of confusion of life and inner re-
lationships, of the evidences of
transcendence, and the fallen na-
ture of man as well as man's alien-
ation with himself.”

Clown With C

Dean Miller moved from the
large~scale metaphor of Faulkner
to “the walking symbol of the
clown" in_his final lecture of the
series Tuesday morning

“In the clown we can see reflec~
tion of reality normally not evi-
dent to us,” he said referring to
the prevalence of clown characters
in the arts of modern times.

Dr. Miller called Charlie Chaplin
“perhaps the greatest clown of our
age" and Emmett Kelley “the
greatest American clown," and
went on to examine the various
clown roles in modern literature.

“The clown has almost a religi-
ous significance," he said. “We
can see in him what we have re-
fused to see in Christ. In this same
context he said that the clown ex-
plores the mythology of self and
expands the dimensions of con-
sciousness. ,

“The clown deals with the cer-
tain categories of ,human exper-
ience that we see as mys-
teries," he continued. He termed
the role of the clown as a transcen-
dent one in relating these mys-
teries.

Tracing the character of Don
Quixote, Dean Miller said that in
having all the characters of a fool,
Cervantes‘ clown was Everyman.

”A fool is a fool, but what about

 

the fool who is wise? Don Quixote
has the intelligent moderation and
kindness to go with the absurd ex-
cesses. This is not in accord with
sheer comedy,” he said.

“Don Quixote acts out of a re
source beyond the banal routine of
facile conformity — in him the
various worlds collide."

Dr. Miller described the inspira-
tion of the clown as "solemn and
naive” and described his as a man
walking on a tightrope — “this is
life" he said.

Discussing Winston Bregner‘s
Doubtlng Thomas, in which all hu-
man action is routinized and every-
thing is computerized, he traced
the actions of the main characteri
Once each year, during a national
holiday, Thomas would escape his
rigid routine. disguise himself as a
clown, and mingle among the
crowds

"After ten years of this he was
held in deep affection — the peo«
ple looked forward to his advent,"
Dr. Miller continued. “In this char-
acter, mankind was redeemed by
the actions of its weakness in the
clown character, He reminded man
of his essential humanity and in
this way mankind is saved,"

According to the lecturer, man
sees in the clown what he prefers
not to see in himself. “The clown
recovers for us the nature of our
humanity,” he said turning to a
discussion of Wallace Steven's
poem, “The Comedian as a Capi-
tal C."

“This poem represents the myth-
ology of self —- man's absurd re-
lationship with the World," he said.

direct reference to Christianity
when he discussed the role of the
ciown as man’s “redeemer.”
“His is a salvation once uttered in
a term we no longer know how to
use — repent," he said

He claimed that the clown brings
mankind back to a two-level world:
“one in the dust and one in the
sky." He called the violence in-tn-
day's entertainment a product of
the one level world. Violence, he
said, is the substitute for humor.

Concluding with a discussion of
Christ in the “clown' role, Dean
Miller drew parallels. “Like the
clown, there is so little‘room in
the world for Christ; he too was in-
cognito — disguised in the flesh, a
nobody. He was despised and re-
jected. The drama of his crucifix-
ion is played against all the pre-
tensions of hispuwer.
