Grinnell to Get the Japanese Treatment
In Culture, Entertainment This Weekend

By Karen Adkinson

Tired of being from the land
of transistors and geisha girls,
the five Japanese students at
.Grinnell are attempting to in-
form the campus about their
country with a Japanese week
end sponsored in conjunction
with the Cosmopolitan Club
and Social Planning Board.

Masakatsu Kato, leader of
the group, said, “Many parts
of Japanese culture have been
oversimplified in popularly
held notions. We Want to clarify
some of the misunderstandings
this Weekend.”

The weekend begins tonight
with a SAGA-served Japanese
meal of curry and rice. Al-
though of Indian origin, this
meal is “common in Japan” a
cording to Kato.

“We had to remember that
this meal was a mass produced
one. It is hard to prBServe the
Japanese flavor of many of our

dishes when served in large
quantities," he explained. “For
the Cosmopolitan Club, the pro-
fessors who have an interest in
Japan, and the Japanese stu-
dents we are having a Sukiyaki
Party in the PDR.”

Tomorrow the weekend will
turn to a more academic ap-
proach as Dr. Hidetoshi Kato,
visiting professor from Japan,
presents a coffee hour at 3 in
Younker lounge. Dr. Kato has
announced he “will speak brief-

Rockefeller Foundation Grant
To Support Minority Education

Grinnell College Wednesday
announced receipt of a $275,000

grant from The Rockefeller
Foundation to support a three-
year trial program to increase
the discovery of talented Negro
and other minority group stu-
dents and to improve their un-
dergraduate education.

In announcing the grant.
President Howard R. Bowen
said $240,000 will be used to pro»
Vlde financial assistance to
qualified students from Negro
and other disadvantaged minor-
ity groups, and $35,000 for such
purposes as recruitment, pre-~
freshman remedial courses.
tutoring, counseling, and gen-
eral administration of the pro-
gram.

“It is our intention to provide
a substantial subsidy through-
out the four undergraduate
years for 30 to 40 students en-
rolled during the trial pro-
gram,” Bowen said. “Grants,
made on a basis of need, will
provide measurable assistance
in meeting the financial emer-
gencies of these students."

 

Funds from the grant will be
a v a i l a b l e for expenditure
through a period ending Dec.
31, 1970.

Bowen also pointed out mat
the Rockefeller grant will have
little, if any, bearing on Grin-
nell’s current program to raise
$4,000,000 to match a $2,000,000
grant offered by the Ford Foun-
dation in 1901. The Ford PrO'
gram is scheduled to end June
30, 1964.

Payments on the Rockefeller
grant will be made on a semi-
annual basis, following receipt
and acceptance by the Foundav
tion of an operating budget at
the beginning of each fiscal
year.

In expressing appreciation of
the gift, Bowen pointed out that
Grinnell has exhibited “a tra-
ditional interest in supporting
the education of gifted. but
needy, students.

“This grant will permit the
college to expand this program
in a dramatic manner which
otherwise .would have been
quite impossible,” he said.

fore the convention could de-
cide on Lodge as its nominee.'

Senator Barry Goldwater led
on the first two ballots, but his
291 votes on these two ballots
were far short of the 648 needed
for nomination.

Lodge moved into second
place on the second ballot and
then surged into the lead with
558 votes on the third ballot. At
this points Lodge’s closest con-
tenders w e r e Pennsylvania
Governor William Scranton,
who had polled 251 votes, and
New York Governor Nelson
Rockefeller, who had 212.

Lodge still had to heat off a
challenge from Scranton on the
fourth and fifth ballots to take
the nomination. Tension rose
0n the fourth ballot as the fast
paced roll call showed that
Scranton possessed an outside
chance to catch Lodge.

At the end of the fourth bal-
lot Lodge was only 21 votes
shy of the nomination, but
Scranton had jumped from 251
to 484 votes. At this point the
Rockefeller forces held the bal»
ance with 183 votes in their
control.

Although Scranton was clos-
ing the gap on Lodge through-
out the fifth ballot, the latter's
lead proved insurmountable.
when Texas cast 32 votes for
Lodge at 11:40 p.m., it was all
over.

Mark Hatfield, the Republi-
can keynoter, won a landslide
victory for the Vice Presiden—
tial nomination, defeating

 

Michigan‘s Governor George
Romney on the first ballot.

A rumored battle for the
Democratic Presidential nom«
ination failed to materialize
Saturday night as Lyndon John-
son easily won the nomination
on the second ballot,

Governor George Wallace of
Alabama was the first to be
nominated at the Democratic
nominating session. Delegates
and spectators heard Wallace
described as a man who loves
his “150 million" fellow citi-
zens. Alabama was described
as one of the most progressive
states in the Union as far back
as before the “War Between
the States."

In addition to Johnson and
Wallace and several favorite
son candidates, the name of
Adlai Stevenson was placed in
nomination. It was rumored
Saturday evening that a full<
scale attempt would be made
by those allies with the Stevem
son forces to capture the nomi-
nation from Johnson. The Stev-
en 5 on challenge collapsed.
however, as Johnson won over
1,000 votes on the first ballot.
He easily won the few morn
votes needed for nomination on
the next ballot.

The Democratic contest for
the Vice Presidential nomina-
tion, which was expected to
match the Republican Presiden-
tial battle, also fell short of ex-
pectations. The victory went to

Student Wants — Increase?

Last night the Social Planning Board passed the proposed
budget set up by the Social Co-ordinating Committee. The ap-
proved budget included a fee increase that will amount to
about $8 per Student. For final acceptance of Such an increase,
the budget must pass the senate appropriations committee,
be approved by the Senate, be presented by the administration,
to the trustees, and approved by the trustees. The administra-
tion has indicated that it would only consider such an increase
after wide student approval. Thus, at the moment, the burden
rests with the students.

’ It is important that students understand the rationale
behind a-social fee increase if they are to pass judgment on
one. Although it is quite natural for students to oppose any
financial increase, it is unusual for a student body to have
the opportunity to voice disapproval before a decision is made.
This alone should make the students wary enough to examine
the situation rather than make an arbitrary decision. ,

’ For those students who have been dissatisfied with this
year's social program, and investigation show there are many,
it does notseem as appropriate to question the quality of those
people who devrse the program as it is to question the material
they have to work with.

‘ Concert prices have been going steadily up iii the last
three years. The concerts committee has been faced with the
decision of financing Several “lesser" names in an extended

program over the year, rather than throwing the whole amount
behind one big name in the fall.

x Similarly, the committee planning formal dances reports
that student attendance for a small, relatively unknown dance
band has been very disappointing during the past several
years. They have gathered from the record that students will
patronize a formal dance only if the band is popular. Thus, for
this year. forlnal dance activities have been pooled into two
large affairs with two big name bands.

Social activities in the new Forum next year will obvious-
ly demand more expenses than those in the make-shift base-
ment union. There is more to decorate and plan for, there is
more incentive behind it, and there is more satisfaction in it.

The Social Coordinating Committee must find itself in a
quandry. It is forced to make decisions concerning the enter-
tainment of the entire student body, yet must bear the brunt
of student dissatisfaction as well as the knowledge that they
can’t afford any better.

There will always be problems of what to choose—not
everyone can be expected to flock to a weekend of folk con~
certs. Likewise, the influx of foreign films this year has dis-
appointed many campu: movie fans who prefer the domestic
films for weekend entertainment, The Social Committee
should make continuing efforts to give the students what they

want. It Should be a matter of investigation rather than an
"educated" guess.

‘ The students, however, must realize the economics limits
in the cu -ent entertainment fields. They should be willing to
rally around even a financial increase that is directly pointed
at doing something for the students.

[Anku Continues Study of Ghana

By Vince Anku

This is the second ariicle in
the series of general remarks I
would like to make about Gha~
na.

Ghana’s foreign policy, which
should indicate Where she is or
is not leaning to the East, is
based on principles of positive
neutrality and Strict lion»align-
merit. This policy enables ihc
government to Speak freely
about ways or making world
peace more Secure. For exam-
ple, Ghana voted against the
Russian idea of the Troika,
urged Russia to agree to disc
armament with onions inspec-
tion, and in the same General
Assembly voted for China’s
admission to the United Na-
tions.

Ghana’s domestic policy is
based on an enlightened demo-
cratic system, in which men
can reasonably express their
opinions. Some American news»
men have constantly charged
Nkrumah Wltll trying to cur-
tail freedom of speech and at—
tempting to have complete
ideological control over all
branches of the government. i
personally know that Ghana-
ianS can freely express their
opinions without fear. One of
my o wn secondary school
teachers used to spend a quar-
ter of the period each day bite
terly criticizing the govern-
ment. He even Called the Pros
ident a “tortoiserheaded fool”
on a number of occasions, but
he is not in ail,

Anyone in Ghana can criti-
one as much as he wants,
However, if he commits sedi-

 

tion, lie is prosecuted in the
civil law courts. No one iS aur
tomatically imprisoned for crit<
iclzing the government, Recent—
ly a commission of jurists pcu-
tioned the president to seem,
state the Chief Justice after the
latter had been dismissed. No
disciplinary action was taken
against them, in addition, ve-
hement public opposition forced
the President to abolish a ten
per cent compulsory saving
law. Detention only occurs if
one is planning to assassmate
the president or to overthrow
the government by force,

Nkrumah quite often acts
only when he is sure the peo-
ple will back him. If they do
not, he does not push them too
hard. He often rebukes his par-
ty officials for their arrogance
toward the common people and
warns them that their real
power is derived from the peo-
ple. If Nkrumah is encourage
ing any kind of dictatorship, as
some members of the Amerie
can press claim, perhaps it iS
the dictatorship of the masses,
This is a possibility in all West
ern democratic political sys-
tems, as Tocqueville has
pointed outl Certainly, Nkru-
mah is not trying to establish
an absolutist state ruled by one
man.

The Ghanaian system is not
a carbon Copy of any other type
of government. It is a welfare
state modified to meet the
needs and conditions of the Air
rlcans. Both Western and East-
ern systems contain desirable
elements. Ghana is free to ex-
tract these beneficial aspects
and blend them with her own

Time, Newsweek and Atlantic

on the changing morality on

under energetic government is
natural and traditional for Af-

Americans think [his statement

to Ghana defended Nkrumah
against Senator Dodd’s attack
of communism: '

"I and two~other American
book publishers were there at
the end of last year on behalf
of Franklin Publications, a lion-
profit American organization
engaged for the past dozen
years in helping the growth or
local book publishing and ihe
spread of American books in
underdeveloped countries.

”Nothing we saw in Ghana
justifies Senator Dodd’s state-
ment and much that we expel"
ienced indicates that Ghana is
an energetic country whose
chances of joining the free,
modern world will be greatly
improved by understanding and
assistance from America. Gha- \

Thus, 1 am not alone in my
optimism about the future of

Costumes for the dances will
be as authentic as possible. For
the skits the costumes will be
more symbolic. An emperor,
for example, will not wear the
dress of a real emperor but
will be dressed "so that peo-
ple will recognize him as an

MaSakatu Said, “This Week-

Letters to the Editor

Students Seek Personal Letters for Memorial Library

Students:

Our generation has experi-
enced few shocks, and none has
moved us more deeply and
none have we shared with more
intensity than the death of
President Kennedy, All Ameri-
cans were stunned and grieved
by his untimely passing, but
perhaps youth felt the blow
more keenly than the rest. He
was a man who shared his
youth and ideals with young
people and awakened within us
the challenge to find a purpose
and to carry out our responsi-
bility to ourselves and to our
country.

We believe that the personal
letters college students wrote to
friends, sweethearts, parents
and others who were close to
them during those days in No
vember would indicate their
true feelings and vividly de-
lcribe the effect of John F. Ken-
nedy’s death upon oLu‘ genera-
tion. In addition to providing a
tribute to President Kennedy,
these letters would serve not
only as a valuable asset to his-
torians, but would clearly de-
pict for the future the emotion-

of America’s young people.

Student Wants Better SGA.
Full-Time Interest in Politics

To the Editor:

it is Indeed unfortunate that
for most student government is
something to think about only
prior to elections, I suggest
that, if the quality of student
government is to improve, and
it must, we will have to consid~
er changes broader in scope
than those afforded by the elec-
toral process. We must begin
by asking ourselves certain
fundamental questions:

ls a structure copied from
the national system really
suited to our needs? Is the
threat of tyranny in our leaders
so great that we must shackle
the system with the elaborate
checks and balances which pre-
vent prompt and efficient ac
tion? And is it necessary to
fragment the functions of stu-
dent government among so
many different cabinets, com-
mittees, councils, and boards?

Our present structure is dem-
ocratic to be sure, if we judge
the democracy of a system by
its resemblance to our Ameri-
can national government. In
fact, we score quite well on
such a comparative test. We
have an executive with a cab-
inet and a veto, a court with 1‘97
view and appeal, and a senate
with representatives, commit-
tees, and all the fits and starts
so common to its national coun-
terpart.

But perhaps this ideal demo-
cratic structure is not What is
needed at Grinnell for effective
and efficient student govern-
ment. Certainly our situation is
vastly different from that en-
countered at the national level,
Our government is faced with a
Higher Good in the form of an
administration Which can over-
rule and negate its action. In
addition, our leaders lack the
skill, found on the national lev-
el, of making a bad system
work well, With a few excep-
tions, those Involved in student
government are students first
and politicians second

 

To make matters worse, the
attempted imitation is a bad
one. Difficulties in the national
system are made impasses in
ours, In place of unified en-
forcement under executive di-
rection we have substituted a
divided police force and made
them independent of the presi-
dent. In place of parties we
have substituted 3 political elite
which divides itself into two
opposing machines for each
year's election. In place of a
tattle-tale press we have sub-
stituted nothing. We hear of ir-
regularities in student govern-
ment only when one faction
becomes incensed at another,
which is seldom. And finally,
our courts have failed to cre—
ate me clear and consistent
legal framework upon which ef-
fective enforcement rests.

The very persistence of these
problems suggests that they are
the result, not of incompetent
leaders, but of an inadequate
governmental structure. Hence,
better government will be
achieved only by broad struc-
tural reform.

It is unfortunate that such
reform must originate in the
senate, for it is perhaps the
most confused and impotent
branch of student government.
This presents a strange para-
dox: if the student senate were
effective enough to initiate the
necessary reform, much of the
reform would be unnecessary,

Determined leadership from
the executive and co-operation
by the courts would be a great
help, but the critical support
for change must come from the
student body at large. For as
long as we have a democrati-
cally styled system, the demos
must bear a large part of the
responsibility. If We are to suc-
ceed in this Herculean effort,
we must be a government of
the many for longer than one
convention session.

The Senate Scene

By WADE STEVENSON

A revitalized Student Senate
met Wednesday night and
adopted resolutions which will
enable that body to assume
tighter control of student funds.
A resolution was passed with
the intent of providing a reme~
dy against the use of funds for
secret parties:

“Be it resolved that: any
student group, with the excep»
tion of residence halls, which
desires to use student funds in
excess of five dollars for a
party or a convention not bud»
getecl for by the Senate must
obtain approval from the Sen-
ate to use these funds.”

The Senate also passed three
other resolutions pertaining to
student finances:

“Be it resolved that: the Ap-
propriatlons Committee shall
be empowered to allocate funds
not exceeding fifty dollars With-
out obtaining prior approval by
the Senate.”

“Be it resolved that: all
funds left over in any student
accounts which contain funds
provided by the Student Gov.
ernment Association, other
then Men’s residence hall ac-
counts, automatically be placed
in the General Budget and Re-
serve fund at the end of each
organization‘s financial year.

eral Budget and Reserve.”

“Be it resolved that: each
campus organization which re
ceives funds from the Student
Government Association be re-
quired to submit detailed state-
ments of financial condition to
the Senate Appropriations Com-
mittee on the first day classes
convene for second semester
and within one week following
spring vacation. Such financial
statements shall include an ac-
counting of all expenditures
made by said organization."

The Senate approved the ap-
pointment of Nord Brue as
campus National Student As-
sociation Coordinator. How-
ever, Jolln Lischer, chairman
of the Nomination Committee,

 

noted that applications for tho
position had not been presented
to the entire body.

Phil Johnson, 5. G, A. Presiw
dent, stated that "such action
is not without precedent,”
Johnson indicated that ”tho

function of the N. S, A. Coordi-
nator is to work closely with tho
executive cabinet and the exe-
cutivs cabinet should be able
to chose someone with Whom
they can work."

Jim Herzog said that he was
“highly critical of any Student
Government which doesn’t op—
en up applications to the entire
student body." Lischer stated
that “the Nomination Commit—
tee has the highest regard for
Brue’s ability, but they are
disturbed by the mechanism
used to nominate him for the
position." ,

After debating the problem
of applications, the Senate
passed the following resolu-
tion:

”Be it resolved that: the
executive cabinet maintain I
policy of open application for
all Student Government A!-
sociatlon appointments.”

Concerning other business,
the Senate asked the executive
cabinet to submit resolutions
on the open lounge rule and
the car rule. Due to a recent
case In which two students
who were apprehended with
automobiles have been asked
to repay a part of their scholar.

long history of annual Fetter

Sing.

First Coed Fetzer Sing ts Scheduled
April 25 to Modify School Tradition

Saturday evening, April 25th,
will mark the 29th annual Fet—
zer Sing. For the first time in
the history of this event, North
and South Campuses have
combined and the competition
will be between mixed chorus-
es.

Fetzer Sing had its begin-
nings in the 1939’s when, with
the help of the women’s glee
club, the women of the Quad-
rangle held annual singing con-
tests. These were held on May
Day, outside of the Quadrangle,
usually on the steps of Main
Hall. John C. Fetzer, men vice
president of Grinnell, was en-
lhusiatic about the event and
wishing to make the program
an all-campus activity, he en-
couraged male participation.
He donated a trophy for the
men, which has passed from
hall to hall since then. During
the war, when the men were
away, the annual sing lost its
male voices, but was revived
after they returned. Fetzer Sing

 

evolved into a Mother's Day
program in which the town of
Grinnell and parents of students
could come to enjoy special
entertainment. More recently,
for practical considerations,
students have felt it; should not
be held so near the end of the
school year.

Since 1935, there has been
some type of intramural sing-
ing competition on the Grinr
nell campus. The main idea he-
hind the program was to pro-
vide an opportunity for students
to enjoy singing together.

During the last four years,
Fetzer sing has been held dii-
terently each year. This year’s
senior class, as freshman, par-
ticipated in an all-campus Fet-
zer Sing held in the afternoon
of Mother’s Day. All of the
women’s halls competed for the
South Campus trophy and the
men’s halls competed for the
North Campus trophy. in 1962
the singing competition was be-
tween women’s hallsonly, and

 

The formal, Hartl said, was
changed from its traditional
date, the night before the be-
ginning or spring vacation, to
take advantage of the warmer
weather and to get the band.
He said the administration also
preferred that the dance be at
another time.

Hartl announced the mem-
bers of the social coordinating
committee, which plans the
campus social programs. and

men’s hallsi

During me initial planning
last semester for the 1964 Fet~
zer Sing, it was suggested that
Fetzer Sing be competition be-
tween mixed choruses. This
suggestion was met with ep-
proval by both North and South
Campuses, and it was an-
nounced that Fetzer Sing would
be a coed event for the first
time in its history.

Since this is the first time
the program has been held in
this way, certain changes have
been necessary. Mr. and Mrs,
Norman Goodbrod, who have
long been associated with Fet-
zer Sing as judges and as in-
terested faculty members, have
agreed to be faculty sponsors.
Not only have they helped the
Fetzer chairmen plan creative-
ly for this year’s event, but
have insured continuity by in-
terpreting the original spirit of
the event to the students.

Since North Younker won the
men’s trophy in three consecu-
tive years, the North Campus
trophy has been retired. A new
trophy as well as plaques for
second and third place winners
will be awarded. The following
pairings have been arranged:

will serve as publicity chairman
for the social coordinating com-
mittee.

At the present time, the so-
cial committees are finishing
preparation of their budgets to
be presented to the social plan-
ning board for approval before
being submitted to the Student
Senate. These budgets include
a request for an increase in
the social fee. Hartl said the
increase, if approved, would be
used to improve the quality of
the program rather than to pro-
vide a significantly larger
number of events.

When asked about Spring
Day, the social coordinator
said, “There is really not too
much I can say about Spring
Day at this time. There will be
a Spring Day, but we want it to
be a surprise."

Prospects for next year in-
clude the grand opening of the
Grinnell Forum, now scheduled
for late October or November,
and an Inaugural ball, if a new
president of the college is
named.

“We would like to be able to
get some people off campus
each weekend to enhance the
program,” l-lartl explained.
There will be attempts to ex-
pand transportation facilities.
on - campus trips will be
handled by the Informal com-
mittee this year. There will
also be an increase in the In-
formal program especially
planned for non-daters.

 

The concerts committee has
already booked the Warsaw
Philharmonic Orchestra for
next year. This committee also
plans to experiment with seat-
ing arrangements in Darby
gymnasium for the various big
concerts held there.

The movies committee will
try toiinclude more American
movies than this year but will
continue to present outstand-
ing work from abroad as Well.

Dithyramb and Gadabouts
will continue with programs
similar to those of last year,
Hart], explained. “We’ll defi-
nitely repeat the Christmas
Formal dinner," he said. Gad-
abouts will be sponsoring three
formal dances. Homecoming
and Parents Weekend fall on
the same weekend next fall,
and one dance will be presented
then, besides the Christmas and
Spring Formal dances. If the
college names a new President,
he said, one of these will be an
Inaugural Ball.

The North and South Campus
social chairmen will he working
with the halls. The North Cam-
pus chairmen will be schedul<
ing informal parties at Oakland
Acres to be offered as package
deals to the halls.

The transportation issue is
not dead either. A committee
will be appointed by the Social

Planning Board to study trans— '

portation at colleges with car
rules similar to ours. They will
also investigate transportation
available at nominal expense
and will recommend action to
the Planning Board.

 

SCARLET AND BLACK

Roberts Theatre

By John Wolf

Remains of a swampy forest
that may have covered the
Grinnell area 130,000 years ago
were discovered by Benjamin
Graham (bid) during excava-
tions for the Fine Arts Center
in June, 1960.

Last July 4, aided by La-
Verne Durkee (him) and Mich-
ael Hager, junior, Graham re-
trieved peat samples from be
neath the stage of Roberts
Theatre shortly before cement
was laid over the site.

“Sample of coniferous wood
found in the peat were readily
identified as Tamarack,” Gra-
ham remarked. “There is some
mineral replacement evident,
but much of the wood is in cel-
lulosic form. Insofar as they
are not completely mineralized,
the samples are not true fos-
sils.

“Several samples of the wood
are now being dated by the
carbon 14 method. The results
might prove inconclusive, 'how-
ever, since carbon 14 dating is
effective only if the samples are
less than 50,000 years Old.

“The samples we have found

“We can’t place the deposits
more exactly because of the
lack of local dateable glacial
deposits from the two most re-
cent periods of glaciation. The
Illinoian glaciation just touched
the southeastern corner of the
state, while the Wisconsin glac—
iation stopped about eight
miles north of Grinnell.

“Had the peat been deposited
during one of the other two
recent glacial periods, the Kan-
sas or Nebraskan, it would
have been fairly easy to date
because of the local sedimentav
tion, often hundreds of feet
deep, which were deposited
during those epochs.

”From an examination of
pollen grains found in the peat,
we have been able to conclude
that the climate of Iowa was
very similar to the climate of
present<day Canada. The spec-
ies of trees are good indicators
of climatic conditions of the
areas in which they are found.”

The peat deposit was actual-
ly two feet below the bottom of
the excavation for the Fine
Arts Center and was discovered
only when deeper borings for
footings brought up samples of
peat. The thickness of the peat
layer is about 1.5 feet, and the

deposit is covered by nearly 16 ‘

feet of topsoil and loess,

Excavations for the new
Forum did not go deep enough
to reach the peat level, al-
though “what appears to be a
shoreline” Was notiCed.

“This shoreline would incli~

cate that there was a lake
through the middle of the cam-
pus at one time,” Graham not-
ed. “It is probable that this
lake became the swampy for—
est,
“It’s just a reflex action for
me to follow up excavations,"
Graham claimed. “Soundings
for the addition to the science
building could provide addition-
al interesting samples for our
study."

Hatfield Stresses
McGee Evaluates

By Susan Taylor

“Ours is a challenge to enun-
ciate the cause of liberty and
freedom,” Governor Mark Hat-
field of Oregon told a Republi-
can audience at the Republican
Mock Political Convention last
Friday night, Hatfield was the
keynote speaker at. the conven-
tion which nominated a Lodge-
Hatfield ticket for the ’64 elec-
tion campaign.

“Can we as Americans and
Republicans oppose the rising
tide of materialism Within our
society, the erosion of liberty
and of freedom, in institutions
and beliefs?” Hatfield asked.
“We have to look beyond the
'ibread-and—butter’ issues to a
declaration of faith in mese is
ones of liberty and freedom,"
he declared.

“We as the minority party
cannot be content with being
merely against. We have to
come forth with the alterna~
tives, with a program that pre-
sents to the American public a

ositive approach and not mere-
y a negative attack,” he said.

He further emphasized the
role of the minority party say—
Ing, “A determined, well-knit»
minority can overcome a com-
placent, lazy majority." “Con-
frontation is our theme at this
moment."

“Ours is indeed the party of
human rights,” Hatfield said.
“There has 'been an erosion
here, We can and We should leg»
[slate men’s actions to eliminate
discrimination. But we have to
serve as an example to elimi-
nate discrimination at the
source.” He charged that the
Democratic administration has
acted against its declared pole
icy. ”We have to do everything
we can to stop the disillusion»
ment of those who think the
possible passage of tile civil
rights bill will bring an end to
the evil," he said.

He Called attention to an
“erosion in our country as to
the moral foundations in our
nation."

“Not what we hold in our
hands, necessarily, but What We
believe in our hearts is that in
which we place our trust,“ Hate
field said. “We have the Cause
and the commitment to re-
claim for America her faith,"
he said of Lhe Republican party.

 

Minority Role:
World Changes

By Ann Showalter

Gale McGee, senator from
Wyoming, launched the Demo-
cratic Mock Political Conven-
tion Saturday by evaluating
some of the changes that have
occurred in the world during
the last four years.

“People no longer speculate
about who will Start the third
world war," he pointed out.

Since the Cuba showdown of
1962, when Kennedy's policy
showed the United States would
risk nuclear war to preserve
freedom in this hemisphere,
“the men in Moscow no long-
er dare to press a bluff in the
confidence that we won’t dare
to call it." _

The United States has fos~
tered the gaining of independ-
ence by many countries dur-
ing the past four years. McGee
feels, “The freedom of these
nations is the greatest single
barrier against Communism.”
He observed, "Not one of these
new nations has turned to Comv
munism."

“Never has our country been
stronger or freer from groups
dedicated to the overthrow of
the government," he asserted.

He attacked name-callingand
labeling as “substitutes for
thinking." When a new idea is
introduced, people may call it
socialistic, communistic, or
unAmcrican without trying to
understand it.

“Liberals wrote the Declara-
tion of Independence, but con-
servatives wrote the Constitu—
tion,” he stated. “Neither Side
has a monopoly on brains."

He called on young people to
meet the challenge of a world
which ”looks to the youth that
is the heartbeat of our his
tory.”

 

Sioux City, he was a candidate
for State Chairman of the Col-
lege YR’s. For the past two
years, he has worked closely
with the Poweshiek County Re-
publican Party, in several cam-
paigns and elections.

Home], Gates, is a member
of the Young Democrats, the
IRC, and the Civil Rights
Group. He is a state delegation
chairman and a campaign
chairman for the Democratic
Mock Convention, and has been
active in church and civil rights
programs, on and off campus.

Johnson, West Norris, is Hall
vice—president and has been a
member of his hall House Coun-
cil for two years. He has been
a young Republican member
since his Freshman year, has
attended State YR Conventions,
and helped organize [or the
YR’s in the 7th Congressional
District.

Clymei‘ will intern with
Jerome Ziegler, Democratic
candidate for Congress in the
14th Congressional District OI
Illinois. Johnson will serve his
internship with Evan I-Iultman,
Republican candidate for,Gov-
ernor of Iowa, and Homel will
intern with Ray Rybacki,
Democratic candidate for Con-
gress from Illinois' Fourth
Congressional District. Ferris'
internship will be with the Re-
publican State Headquarters at
Des Moines.

Each Intern will receive a
grant of $500 for the formal
twormonths internship, with the
expectation that he will be
placed on the host's payroll for
the third Summer month.

Collection of Etchings hy Gian Pirunesi
OH View in Schaeffer Through Apr. 27

Now on view in Scheaffer
Gallery in the Fine Arts Center
is a collection of 82 etchings by
the 18th-century Italian artist
Gian Battista Piranesi.

The prints were a 1962 gift
from Mrs. Marjorie C. Mur-
phy and her daughter. Mrs.
Elizabeth Carter, in memory of
John Frederick Murphy, ’10,

The exhibition includes the
famous ”Carceri" (prisons) se-
ries, which features 16 etchings
of imaginary prison interiors
through which the artist ex-

ploited his fascination with pere
spective in the creation of in.
terior spaces of overwhelming
and oppressive scale.

Another series of 16 prints
represents imaginative recon-
structions of Roman ruins. Pin
ranesi’s youthful ambition to
be an architect was never grat-
ified. As an artist he indulged
himself in picturing what his
time could not patronize—mans
umental architecture.

Piranesi's etchings will be on
view through April 2.

Baseball Team Splits with Coe:
To Travel to Cornell Tomorrow

The Pioneer varsity baseball
squad split a doubleheader wtth
Coe last Saturday after losing
their opener to Central, 10-1.

The Pioneers traded shutout
victories with the Kohawks, los-
ing the first game, LO, and then
coming back in the second
game to shutout the Kohawks,
3-0.

in the ﬁrst game, the K0-
hawks scored their lone run
in the first inning, on a single
and two Pioneer errors. The

Pioneers had men on base

and in scoring position sev-

eral times during the game
but couldn‘t drive a run in.

Grinnell's D e n n y Hanssen
pitched the whole game for the
Pioneers, giving up six hits and
striking out 11. *

In the second game of the al-
ternoon, Barry M. Anderson
and Cal Collier teamed to shut
out the Kohawks, 3o, giving up
only three hits.

Grinnell dropped its third
game of the season Tuesday to
Simpson, when Simpsm’s Dave
Lansing belted a tenth inning
“Grand Slam” home run to give
the game to Simpson, 10—7.

Grinnell broke a 4-4 tie in the
top of the tentill with three runs.
Simpson then came back with
six runs in the bottom half of
the inning to give them the
game.

 

The Pioneers travel ton-lor-
row to Cornell for a double-
header that is of great impor-
tance to both teams,

If either team can come away
with a sweep, its chances of
challenging defending division
champion Knox for the title
would be enhanced. A split
would knock neither team out of
the chase, but a double loss
would make it hard to rebound.

Probable starters for Coach
John Pfitsch‘s crew will be
Denny Hanssen, the victim of
an unearned run last weekend
that let him lose H), and Bar-
ry Anderson, who combined
with Pfitsch's ace reliefer, Cal
Collier, to throw a Uhree-hit
shutout.

Even with this fine pitch-
ing, Pfitsch still has prob-
lems. “We‘ve got to find a
couple more hitters to help
Collier, Steve Tilly and Dick
Ulrich.

“These three can’t carry all
the load, but have had to thus
far." Last weekend, Collier led
off three innings with either
hits or a walk and then scored
on singles by Tilly and Ulrich.

Possible plate support could
come from Nick Nonas, who
has taken over the catching
chores, or Dave Synhorst, who
appears to be a permanent fix-
ture in left field.

 

Golfers Take Tenth Straight:
Defeat Knox. MonmouthI ISU

By Andy hushnell

The Grinnell College golt
team made it through the first
week of the golf season unde-
ieated. bringing their string oi
Midwest Conference victories
10 10 in a row.

Last Saturday, the Pioneers
played host to Knox and Mon-
mouth. downing Monmouth, 15-
o. and barely getting past the
Knox Siwash, al/z-oI/z.

Monmouth’s iour top men
combined to outshoot Grinnell's
top four by one point, but Al
Peterson, the fifth men topped
his opponent by five, and the
Pioneers won with four fewer
strokes, 390494.

Dave Sellergren was medalist
With an 18 hole total of 73. Ted
Risser shot a 75, Eric Miller.
77, Russ Hardin 79, and Peter-
son finished with 86. Jim Mi-

chaels and Dave Howland led
Knox with totals of 75.

At Ames on Tuesday, the Pio-
neers ran into “the toughest
course in Iowa," according to
Sellergren, and a strong Iowa
State team. Again, however,
the Grinnell linksters came out
on top, 81/2-61/2 although the to-
tals were not nearly as impres-
Sive.

Seliergren and Risser took
top honors, both carding 79's.
Eric Miller shot an 85, Hardin
took an 88 while Mike Miller
carded a 107, Rick Johnson
paced the Iowa State team with
an 82.

Two more matches are sched-
uled for this week. On Satur-
day Grinnell hosts St. Olaf, and
on Monday the Pioneers travel
to Northfield, Minnesota, to
play Carleton.

Nelmen Win First
Against Goe, 5-4;
To Host Garleton‘

By Ken Clymer

A weak Pioneer tennis team
squeaked by a veteran Coe
squad last Wednesday by a
score of 5-4, victors for Grin-
neil included the number three
four, five and six singles play-
ers and the second doubles
team.

Mike Greenfield at number
three singles managed to edge
his opponent in a long three set
match 3-6, 6-4, 7-5. In the fourth
spot, Bob Kornfield was fol-

lowed hy sophomore Roger
Abendroth who won easily 6-3,
6-0. The final singles winner
was Fred Miller who Won 4-6,
6-4, 674.

In the number one spot Grin-
nell’s Larry Shannon lost 7-5,
62 while Ken Clymer at the
second spot lost a close 1H), 6-4
decision. Shannon and Clymer
teamed up to play Coe‘s first

Kato Describes Fictitious Town
In Iowa for Japanese Audience

Mr. Hidetoshi Kate is visit-
lug Grinnell this semester as a
professor of sociology and Far-
Eastern history. His home is
Kyoto, Japan, where he was en-
[aged in research for the Re-
hearch Institute for Humanis<
tic Studies at Kyoto University
,When he was invited jointly by
[he State College of Iowa and
Grlnnell College to come to
America and teach for a year.
He plans to continue doing re-
search when he returns to Ja-
pan this summer.

This is not Mr. Keto’s first
Qisit to America. He came once
to do postgraduate study at
Harvard. where he studied with
David Riesman, author of The
Lonely Crowd. He came again
to participate in a conference
on International Communica-
tions at Stanford University.
Mr. Kato is accompanied on
this visit by his wife and his
two children. Mari, 5, and Fu-
chari, almost 2. ,

The children, according to
Mrs. Kato, like America very
much, especially American
television. Mari speaks English
.well and she attends nursery
lchool here. Fu-chan (a pet
name) does not say much yet
hut he is full of curiosity.

Mr. Kato is perhaps best
gnown in Japan as an author.

e is presently contributing a
series of articles to a Japan-
ese magazine similar to Time
called ”Letters From a Small
‘American Community” The
letters come from the fictitious
town of Springfield, lowa, a ru-
ral community of about 10,000

tice Warrelt’rremark that thi

people, similar to Grinnell,
which Mr. Kato constructed
after talking to many Iowans
with varied occupations and
gathering an impression of what
the average Iowa farm town
would he like. Mr. Karo com-
mented that the main difference
that he noticed between Amer-
ican and Japanese farms was
the greater technological devel-
opment here. Many Japanese
farms are too small and hilly
even to accommodate a tractor.

0f the books he has written
the most recent is The History
of Vis ual Communication;
which discusses the develop-
ment in Japan such non-verbal
means of communication as pic-
tures, architecture. folk singing,
and dancing. He has also writ»
ten a book called, The World of
Eyes and Ears, in which he dis
cusses such varied phenomena
as comic books, pin ball ma-
chines and how the American
cocktail party compares to a
Japanese tea party.

In addition to teaching his-
tory and sociology courses at
Grinnell, Mr. Kato. who felt his
students might like to study
their subjects in the original

 

language has organized a class
in writing, reading and speak-
ing Japanese, He hopes to leave
his class with enough proficien-
cy to be able to get along in the
language in Japan.

Mr, Kato’s home, Kyoto, was
formerly the capital of Japan
for 1000 years. There is no in-
dustry there except handcrafts,
and no agriculture. It remains
ancient and traditional, retain-
ing many of the customs tour-
ists associate with Japan, such
as tea ceremonies and flower
arranging. Kyoto is an academ-
ic center, the site of several col-
leges and universities, Approx-
imately 60,000 students make
up one-sixth of its population.

Mr. Kate said that it is only
recently that the Japanese have
adopted a Western system of
education. He praised small
liberal arts colleges like Grin-
nell warmly, saying that they
were leading the trend in influ-
encing young people to seek
real, meaningful goals instead
of material advancement.

Mr. Kato will speak on Japan-
ese culture at 3 p.m., Saturday,
in Younker lounge during Jap—
anese Week,
