Washington Demonstration Boasts
Both Beards and Mothers in Protest

By BOB HDDIERNE

As demonstrations with 25,000-
50,000 people go, last Saturday’s
Peace March in Washington Was—
n’t much to “write home aboutr"
Or at least on the surlace it
Wasn’t much.

The march was well organized,
smoothly run and easily ended~
which removes most at the typi-
cal news attractions such as tights,
mass arrests and other similar
disturbances. The match was so
well run and the demonstrators
so well disciplined that even a
determined groop oi counterrdemr
oustrators could not get anything
started. George Llncoln Rockwell
did jump cue marcher who was
cariytng a Viet Cong ilag, and
several or his colleagues tried
much the same thing out they
were all quietly hauled away and
then ignomtniously lined a mere
ten dollars and set tree.

The Washington policeLno no-
vices when it comes to this sort
of thing—must be given tremen-
dous credit for the patient, almost
courteous way in which they han-
(lied the marchers. They know all
the tricks of handling crowds.

But just as important in main-
taining order were tlhe “marshals"
oi the participating organizations
—marked by orange arm bands—
who kept the crowds moving—a
Washington ground tulkand‘ who
otherwise assisted the police in
maintaining a semblance Di order.

All or this surtace tranquility
on the part of the marchers is

 

somewhat deceiving, however. A-
mong their ranks were at least
three distinct iactions all fighting
to gain control at the socalled
Peace Movement. The groups—
loosely identified—Were a moder-
ately left wing iaction, a radical-
ly leit wing traction and the South-
ern delegation, the civil rights
people whose support is being
sought.

At the convention which was
held in Washington most at the
week proceeding the actual dems
onstiauon, these groups [ought
openly, olten to the point of
wrestling matches tor the mlcm~
phone. or the three groups, the
civil rights people were the least
interested, In fast, they were
down right cold about the whole
idea at getting involved in a move
ment that would “use" them
more than "aid” them. So while
the radical and moderate groups
taught between themselves they
also were righting to keep the
souLhern delegation interested,

telling the southern delegation that®

they were all bound together by
a common interest in “self-deter-
minatlion.”

On a somewhat ditferent level,
the differences within tlhe move-
ment were readily visible just by
watching the crowd Saturday. lt
ranged mm the usual bearded,
longrnaired “heats” to ministers
in conventional, conservative
suits, to middleaged matrons car-
rying signs asking to have their
"boys" hack home.

iRich Character Interpretation
Viewed as High Point of Play

By MARY MALCOLM _
Audience and actors rollickod
together to a riotous evening on
Monday and Tuesday evenings at
the college Piayers’ perlormonce
oi Phillip King’s See How They
Run, directed by Tanya Hovanne
sian.

The farce, given a masterful
climax by its cast, called for rich
character interpretation and ac
tors let loose with gestures, facial
expressions and accents that con-
sistently hit their mark.

Debbie Abbott, as Ida the maid,
delighted the audience with her
scatterbrained simplicity and at»
iusive enthusiasm. As the pun

i2

tanical Miss Skillon, Melinda
Ward reached a. high point at
cumbersome lack of dignity,
spending much of the play drunk
in the closet

J. Laird Garland and Cathy Cosr
man played the vicar Lionel Toop
and his wife Penelope. Garland
was equally at home on stage and
running around cit-stage, as well
as in his parson's costume and
“state of undress.” MlSS C05-
man's acting ability was most
manitest and delightlful in hEr ex-
pressions of openreyed and inno-
cent non-complicity in the insane
atmosphere at the Vicarage.

Bill Downey played Clive with
comically extreme but always ap<
propriate over-acting. The Com-
munist spy was done with con-
trasting and equally effective r5<
straint: by Max Heliigott, Rick
Roehlk, as the bespectacled Hum-
phrey, expressed the audience's
own happy confusion with his bat-
ﬂed, good-natured sincerity. Ken
Hicks dashed irantlcally about as
the pajamaed bishop and cap-
tured the proper ratio of absurdity
and pomposity. Bruce McConach-
ie, as the Cockney sergeant, was
most notable for his cavedrin
chest and protruding abdomen.

Cowles Dinner
Fetes Children

By ANNE FARRER

Parking their boots in the hall
and their bubble gum behind their
ears, approximately 125 ﬁrst
through sixth graders descended
on Cowles last night for the Uncle
Sam’s Club Christmas Dinner,

Eating, squirming, giggling, spill-
ing milk, and eating some more,
they made short work or roast beef
and apple pie They presented,
perhaps, a pint-sized version of the
North Campus Problem — no one
could exactly define the situation
and anything went.

Grinnellians scrambled to wipe
the noses or, get third helpings for,
and discuss new math somewhat

, intelligently with, their respective

guests. Although entertainment was
provided by means of Scarlateers.
Tanagers, and cartoons, Santa
Claus Milt Tootle (ho, ho) put on
the biggest show, as he passed out
treats.

The evening proved a reciprocal
fun for the younger generation and
success — it provided food and
sublimation for the older WiLh

 

Following open house on both
North and South campus from
8:309:30. the Three Souls, a jaZl
instrumental group, will provide
music tor dancing in the North
Lounge. The music will also bl
piped into the South Loungl
where tables will be set up.

The Forum will be decorated
for Christmasqlne decorations ins
eluding seven Christmas trees and
a photo exhibit oi the activities
held in the Forum during its first
year.

Also on the weekend calendar
is The Third Man, a film directed
by Carol Reed. It will be shown
tomorrow at 8:00 and again Sun-
day at 9:30 in ARH Auditorium.

A thrilling mystery story, it
deals with an out-otrwork writer
who returns to Vienna to renew
an acquaintance with an old
friend, Harry Lime, but arrives

A Tradition . .

o

It's a tradition that each new editor a given his first
chance at editorial power »— set forth his views of and plans‘

for tlle newspaper. Essentially I'm an iconoclast, a conscious
malcontent, and rebel in the face of such a dogmatic tradition.

However, after careful consideration of several factors,
I have decided to write that same editorial. I came to this
decision, by the way, when I observed the ten inch empty
space in the upper left hand corner of this page and realized
I didn’t want to talk about hall reorganization (and neither do
many other people, SGA included), I didn’t want to talk about
abolishing finals (I don’t think about finals let alone talk about
them), and I didn’t want to talk about student apathy. I just
couldn’t work up the energy to talk about that last one.

To the point: I don’t think you're going to see any star~
tling changes in the 8&3, John has worked up a pretty good
staff, has a fairly smooth operation going. Why should I rock
the boat? There are some small technical matters where we
will differ. I, for example, will probably use larger headline
sizes. Essentially, however, we are in agreement about news
papers and so you will see no purge, no great rebellion.

What are you likely to see? You are likely to see a great-
er interest in schools other than Grinnell. You may see a no-
ticeable increase in concern about things that happen outside
of our sequestered little Skinner box on the prairie. You may,
in tact, find an editor who is quite bored with things that have
concerned campaigning editors of the bygone days. I’m not
likely to become upset about SGA elections and the like. I
might be inclined to be more upset if a program that stood a
chance of really doing or accomplishing something failed.
Like the Des Moines project — as a random example 0r like
the LeMoyne exchange program a for another.

Wittgral Says Spending for NSA
ls Legitimate Function tor SGA

To the Editor:

Paul Thurston presented an in-
teresting personal appraisal of the
Des Moines Project in last week’s
see. He implied in his letter, how
ever, that the $250 expended _an-
nually for Grinnell's affiliation
with the National student Asso-
ciation and for implementation of
NSA programs on campus comes
from "money allocated for social
purposes." I would like to clarify
the exact financial nature ot Grin-
neu College’s relationship with
the NSA.

Using the academic year 1965»
1966 as a pertinent example, of the
$2,600 comprehensive fee paid by
each Gn’nncu student, $50 was ear
marked as an activity fee. From
that $50, the Grinnell Student So.
cial Coordinating Committee re»
ceived 521 {or the implementation
of its various campus social pro-
grams. The remaining 323 of the
activiiy fee was shared by the
men's and women's residence
halls, the student publications, the
roium, the student auditor and
the Student Government Associa
tion. it was from the student gov»
ernment’s total allotment of $1,630,
or approximately one dollar aild a
half out or each student's activity
fee, that the Student Senate de-
cided to budget 3250 for Grinnell’s

dent money allocated tor social
purposes; it came from student
money allocated for the operation
of the Student Government Asso-
ciation.

The jet airliner is more than a machine. The Con»

Pleta or The Divine Comedy, seltvtranscendence, the
quality oi convincing the beholder that it is what it is
not: stone Mary and the dead Clirist, words a uni-
verse. A machine is only as noble and significant as
its function. We attribute to a computer, for example.

ability to “think." It Lherelore takes on (or us a mell-

Student Opposes Class Segregation,
Supports Unstratitied Hall Reforms

To the Editor:
I have been following with in-
terest the discussion of the resi»
deuce hall system at Griunell and
have been somewhat dismayed that
the only concrete suggestion of
change has involved an integration
of the sexes with a segregation by
classes. ‘

To separate students by classes
seems to me to be more arbitrary
than to separate them by sex. The
only rationale which seems to mo.

tivate this is the desire Io extend
the privileges of upperclassmen,
while providing “an apprentice

men. in this headlong rush for a

forgotten and their contribulion

to hall life has been ignored.
Integration of the classes has

recently been Alislituled on South

Campus with a success that makes
a return to separation or classes
irrational. For every impression
able lrcsliman who has been ini-
tiated into the evils of the jaded
uppcrclass existence, there are a
dozen whose contact with upper
clnsswolllcn has served to acquaint
them with a serious commitment
to studying, to soothe their home-
sickness, to enable them to discuss
ideas in a dispassionate manner.
and to cope with the barrage or
new experiences, both social and
intellectual, with which college
has assailed them. For the ini-
mature freshman, the uppcrclcss
man is a necessary guide; for the
mature freshman, she is is neces
sary companion. To remove her
would be a return to the ilnspeak»
able frivolity of Mears and Main
three and tour years ago.

This is not to say integration by
sex or ioinoval of restrictions
should be abandoned with the re-
iection of segregation by classes.
This would be throwing out the
baby with the bath water. But to
keep the bath water would wrinkle
the baby pretty badly. So think
twice about the advantages or send
ration by class and work harder
to find an alternative which would
give you what you want most.

To the Editor:

in recent weeks there has been
much discussion concerning the
North Campus Problem. Last week
President Leggett indicated in the

pretty prevalent on North Campus”
and also “there is excessive moral
neutrality in the residence hall
system." Perhaps, but I do not
wish here to discuss this sublect.

LSD is an artificial drug which
produces a blissful, ecstatic,
transforming experience full or
meaning and perceptual beauty.
It gives the subject a sense of
integration and unity wth the un-
iverse. However, the drug can
have serious side sheets—especial-
ly to the unstable.

Antioch’s administration, with
the help of a psychiatrist, is in-
vesiigating the student use of
LSD, but oltticially the problem is
in the hands ot the police.

Seek Recruits for Christmas Voter rbrive

Five major Civil rights organi-
zations (SNCC. MFDF, SCLC,
CORE, and NAACP) are enlisting
college students to spend a “Free
dom Christmas" in the South.
Students selected for tile project
will be working during their christ-
mas vacations in ongoing Negro
voter registration projecis in six
southern states (Mississippi, Ala-
bama, Georgia, Louisiana, North
and South Carolina).

“Freedom Christmas" valuw
teers will work primarily in coun-
ties which have federal registrars.
Organizers of the project teel that
in ihese areas a great deal can
be accomplished in ihe shun
time allowed. Since primary elec-
tiuns will be held in some areas
as early as May 3, 1966, a sum-
mer registration drive would come
too late to affect. the elections.

while (in sabbatical leave 1962363.
His lecture traced the Creative
work trom the impulse in the cre-
ator to its presentation to the pub-
lie.

“The question was,” explained
Meyer of the critics' reaction,
“should it have been Written at
all?” “Alter the Fall” is a thinly
veiled, autebiographic drama of
Miller’s lite and inner struggle
through two marriages, Miller's
second wile was Marilyn Monroe,
who ended their marriage aiter
rive years by suicide. The play’s
unusual artistic formifragmentary
construction and open staging —‘
and the obvious identity or thel
characters led the critics to ones-i
tion Millers motives in writing it.

Meyer, who knew and workedl
with Miller on the production, re-l
filled this criticism leveled against
the playwright when the playl
opened. “He did not write the play
tor sensationalisin or money. He‘
worked lroin sincere, deeprfelt, and
honorable motives."

Meyer's lecture explained the
history or the play through the lite
of its autliur. Citing Miller’s ear-
Iier plays, “All My Sons,”

Ever Merle Public
lli‘ “hill or A re Frill”

"Dedlh of a Stiles’mt‘in,“ tilitl “The
Crumble“ ver said tlli’lL lli
“Crucible” it seemed that man liiltl
reached the high point oi moral
cvullltlun. Bcloic his next pliiy
came the “joltlllg realization" of
the “inability of all his will to
save his Marilyn.”

“Miller is a full time intellect-
ual,” asserted Meyer, who is
afraid of his emotions and WhOSe
only release is to quickly put them
into words. Thus explained, the
play was a painiul and tliiticult
but necessary creation of Miller’s.

“ ‘After the Fall” is rooted in
guilt." Meyer said. It is the pro-
duct of Miller’s “quest Within him-
self” following his Wife's suicu‘le.
‘He recovered her time and again
irom death," Meyer said

In the play, Quinton is in the
role of the savior. He believes that
If there is love, it must be limit-
less. But Maggie will not allow
him to save her. He pleads with
her, “You eat those pills tu blind
yourselii Do the hardest thing or
all — see your guilt and live!" But
iinally he sees that to embrace his
idea of limitless love is to be God.
Limitless love is impossible for
main, And as the probable third
Wile says, “One must finally take
ni'ie's life In one’s own arms."

Meyer told at how Miller him-
seli had explained the message or
“After the Fall” on opening night.
“ ‘Guilt is the false face one gives
one’s knowledge or responsibility
Guilt is an Evasion.

T0 the Ediltti':

it is i'dlhet‘ interesting, in the
light ot eiirront indications on the
part oi Sccrctory ot Detensc lilo
Namai'a that our troop commit-
merit in Viet Nam will soon be
increased, to take iiotc oi a recent
statement by Secret y of State
Rusk at Rio De Janeiro as to the
naturc ol our commitment in Viet
Nam. According to an AP article
which appeared in the Des Moines
Register, Secretary Rusk defined
our commitment as ﬁlm oi prov
ing to the Communists that wars
oI liberation are bound to be tin»
succcssiul, and that, “When that
type of aggression is turned back,
as it will be, then the clouds of
war will begin to dissipate and
men will be able to look ahead
with confidence and hope."

There is implicit in this state-
merit a commitment on the part
of the United States to combat
these “wars or liberation" where»
over lhey occur on the grounds
that they are all part of a long-run
strategy for global domination
which his bcoii iorniuloted in Pe-t
king oi Moscow. This might or;
seen as logic extension oi the.
containment policy toimulated byi
Gcoigc Kclinan in the immediate;
po an era but it is not it isi
moie increasing inflexibility of oi
comiiiitinciit in Viet Nam and out i
general commitment to ultimately'
disprove the theory of world domi-
nation through “wars or libero
tion" which is evident in a further
statement by Rusk that “the iii-
tegrity of the American govcri

men at stnirc in the outcome
or our present policy.

It is the belief of this writer
that the Clliicnl. commitment as
detined by Rusk (and thus sup
posedly the administration), is too
gcncial to he sustained. and thus
is unrealistic. Victory in Viet Nam
may not, in actuality, result in a
dissipation of the clouds of war.
The present failure of the United
States policymakers to discrimi»
hate between indigenous national-
ist revolutions and global “‘Cum»
munist conspiracy” is likely to as-
sure our continued participation in
wars of the Vietnamese type ior
years to come.

The neighboring nations in
Southeast Asia are not lnvulner-
able to the kind or upheaval which
is being experienced by South Viet
Nam. As the process of economic
development accelerates and the

impact of modern industrial tech-
iiology makes itself incrcusiiigiv
felt in these areas, they become
more susceptible to the kind or
social unrest which gives rise to
revolutions. It is not important
whether these revolutions are fu-
inented by Peking or not, what is
important is the ivay Washington
views them. If we continue to view
all national insurrections in which
Communists are participating as
being directed by Peking then we
are committed, according to the
above statements by Rusk, to con.
tinuous intervention and blood;-
shcd around the globe. Whether
or not this kind or intorterencc in
other nations' business is right or
not is not at issue hero The point

Saturday were varied, as variedas the people taking
part and as varied as the views represented

Outwardly, the demonstrations were well organ-

tured on the left that the organizing was‘ done. It Was
from this ex-book store that the coordinating influences
of the national organizers went forth

The contrast in people was sharp There were
young “beatniks” and middle-aged mothers; clean-cut

.V. motion picture cameras kept rolling along record-
1g the scene for the next day’s newscasts.

The only violence that took place during the demon-
trations involved marchers who were carrying the
kg of the Communist Viet Cong. In the picture in the

pper right hand corner, the flag with star in the cen-V

r is the Viet Cong flag. It is being carried by Walter
Aague, who earlier had been attacked by George
incoln Rockwell. Teague told reporters that he was
arrying the flag because he felt it unfair that the gov-
rnment of North Viet Nam was not represented at the
emonstration. Teague said he has had no contact with
1 Viet Cong and stated further that he had made the
ag himself. The group carrying the Viet Cong flag was
the minority and the national committee tried to
Lcourage their presenceibut with obvious lack of
ccess.

Jeff Herf, pictured in the lower right hand corner,

as one of the Grinnell “delegation" to attend the
1arch. On the 24 hour bus ride home several of the
"dents spoke expressing their opinions about the
larch and the movement. Said Herf: “We've just
emonstrated against our government and we should
ﬁ‘ow what we did. This should not have been an easy
ecision. We shouldn’t have come for vague reasons.
Le shouldn’t have any delusions about the effect of the
cmonstration. It probably won’t have any effect. We

take care of you. Everywhere
l’ve gone around this country, ex.
cept when you go to a peace creep
rally as we came down here, know-
ing what we’d lace, everywhere
you go, the American people are
fed up with communism, they’re
red up with subversion, and they're
fed up with race mixing Both
North and South. And when they
say to me. "yes, but you're too
awful. you're a Nazi," you know
what i say? “Well, maybe I'm too
awful, but at least we're out there
where the enemy is." Here you
are and here I am,

. . . There’s only one way to deal
with treason, ladies and gentlemen,
the constitution sets it iorth, when
you adhere to the enemies oi our
country. You’re helping to kill
Americans right here today, right
where you are. It will be in the
newspapers that you were here,
and they will have more spirit to
right on and kill more Americans.

You're killing Americans, you
tilthy creeps. Are you proud of
it? . . . (Yeah!") . r . Somebody
actually said yes, that they‘re
proud to kill an American.

Shame, shame, I never thought
l’d see this day. I usually keep
pretty cool in these operations,
but this is one of the most de5r
plcable and rotten that l’ve ever
seen.

For the beneﬁt of anybody here
that‘s still a good American and
realize what stench I have here
in {rent at me, let me say this . . .
(“Yeah and you make that
stench") . . . A lot of the conserv-
atives have a motto, “better dead
than red." We consider this to be
defeatism and it’s Yellow. And the
reds, these kind at peace creeps
here, say it‘s better to be red than
dead, one of them just hollered it.
Well, our motto, ladies and gentle-
men, is a ltttle diiterent. Our mot-
to is, “Not dead, not red. Dead
reds!"

Merry,
Christmas

Pfiisch Mourns-Soccer Void:
Blames Disinferest. Finances

By DICK CHADY

There was no soccer team this
year because Grinneli apparently
lacks the players, the coach, and
the money to support one,

In a recent interview, Direcwr
of Athletics John Ptitsch explains
ed the combination of factors that
led the department to curtail the
sport in 1965.

In the first place, “we didn't
have the kind or interest to rein-
force meshalf into thinking of the
program as a going concern."
Turn-out tor the team was high
when Grinnoll began the sport in
1961, but with succeeding years
“it became more 01' a struggle to
get numbers to participate,"

Ptitsch speculated that interest
may have been higher in the tirsi
years because of a number or stu-
dents from the East who had
played before,

However, last year a freshman
team could not be filled, and part
of the varsity was recruited by
coach Simone 1mm his swimming
team. This year Simone is on
leave, and another coach would
have to be found,

The decrease in playerrinterat
and Simone's absence both occur-
red at a time when a reduced
athletic budget dictated a reduc-
tion in activities.

When the department received
a cut of about $1400, it was de-
cided to restrict activities in one
area, instead of aCrDSSvthstaYd,

psrtment submitted its budget to
the college last spring, no pn)
vision was made for a soccer
team.

This year an unofficial ciuﬂ
was organized, with Fred Miller
and AI Rossman as cocaptains.
Eighteen players turned out for
regular practices and paid their
transportation tor two “away”
games at lower and SCI,

Previous Grinnell teams had at
compete wiLh eiLher the very good
or the very bad. Sorne schools
such as WheatDn, MaoMurray, and
Lake Forest had well-established
programs in the sport, while most
of the Iowa schools maintained on,-
ly clubs.

Dirk Baay, who was a part-
time coach and reieree tor the
Club this year, feels “it was a
had time tor us to drop out." He
said that there is a growing in»
latest in soccer and that four or
ﬁve schools in the Midwest Con—
ference now have teams.

Baay noted that even with I
rough schedule, the Pioneers had
a record of 22-7-1 in four years
or competition. He believes that
ii the sport is re-instituted on a
team basis there will be Suiltcient
interest to maintain a good pro-
gram.

Pfltsch said he also favors “a
broad program" and that the
primary reason for the lack of a
team is ﬁnancial. But he also
feels that. a successful team will
require "a teal promoter to re
criiit players."

Pioneers Start Roundball Season
With Jaunts to Knox, Monmouth

The Pioneer basketball team
will be showing some new faces
this weekend when the hoopstets
travel to Knox and Monmouth for
the season openers, Sophomore
center Roger Able has virtually
clinched a starting position along
with returnees Elliott Hibbs and
.iett Frantz. Battling tor the other-
two starting positions are sopho-
mores Greg Rankin, Mike Sch-
wartz and Dick Musser, and lel-
termen Ted Risser and Tom Hill.
Also slated tor action are Dick
Lovell and Bob Watt.

Knox and Monmouth are noi
ranked as two of the strong
teams in the conference but both
have many veteran pcttotmets
back this year.

This year coach Plitsch has de-
clded to change his offense irom
the iastbreak pressing attack at
last year to a more controlled
type. Last year the Pioneers were
able to score but the deleiise and
rebounding was so weak that the

 

Pioneers could win only tive ot
eighteen conietence games.

The new otiense, called the Au-
burn Shuttle, is designed to let
the team set up for the good shot.
Pfitsch also hopes this Will allow
the Pioneers to grab more re
bounds, both oltensiveiy and de
fensively, because they will be
able to get better position uncler
the boards,

With the Friday night and Sat—
urday atlemoon games through-
out: the season last year, Pittsch
thought the Pioneers tired out. It
showed at the end of time season,
when the Pioneers were able to
win unity one game out 01 the
tinal eight.

Ptitscli is happy With the prog-
tess oi the team so far, consider»
ing that tour players started late
because 01 iootball.

The varsity beat the ireshmen
last Saturday 7250 to start the
season. Especially impressive tor
the trash were Tom Lower, Sam
Semi, and Thor Evenson.

pleted their iitth week ot practice
in preparation for two dual
meets and a tournament below
the semester ends. Grinnell Will
host Dubuque University and
Wartburg College tomorrow at

changes are in eitcct this year——
a few of which deserve mention.
A new weight class has been

added so that the range in the

160. All t/akedowns this season
are worth two points (prior to the
change, only the first TD by each
wrestler was Warth two with suc-
ceeding TD’s counting one point).
Also, up to two points may be
gamed tor riding time where
previously only one could be
scored. These changes, as well as
some others, may have an im~
portant bearing on match results.
There are tive lettermen return-
ing trom last year’s team, out six
of the other seven varsity squad
members are saphomores. While
these sophomores wiil till most of
the remaining positions, there are
