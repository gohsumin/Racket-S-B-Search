Men 0r Marmalade?

Men have always loved to label. Tlley have labelled
with equal zeal everything from plum preserves and paclo
ages to races, religions and beliefs. We have little argument
with the plum preserve people. Where this sort of thing
can become dangerous however, is outside of tlle kitchen
or the posteoffice, in history books, the arguments of care
less debaters and on the college campus.

, Jiidx‘ ”null. sum FM“

One such careless form of labelling seems to be occur—
ring presently at Grinnell. Some people are delighting iii
pointing fingers and loosely assigning" tlle titles of ”Con-
servative” and “liberal” to almost everything and everyone
\in sight. It seems to us that these are rather strange lines

of demarcation on a campus dedicated to liberal education,
a campus where so many shades of belief ex t.

Furthermore, nobody seems to be very sure just what
these labels mean. The best we have been able to get from
the average Grinnellian who is freely using these terms are
personal references. “So and So is a conservative” ”So and
So is a liberal.”

, Last week‘s “Forum for Dissent” suggests a specific
instance of dﬁigerous labelling in the college community.
Labelling professors according to supposed political beliefs
can lead to the worst sort of academic calamity. Would it
not be contrary to everything this college stands for if
professors were hired on the basis of their political at-
t"udes rather than their abilities in various fields? The
extremes of tapeerecorders iii the classroom, suppression of
opinion and eventually loss of academic freedom are only
steps away from this kind of thinking.

It is interesting to see how careless sorts of labelling
fall down in practice. An example of this was seen at a re-
tent coffee hour when two professors, supposed ”liberals”,
took almost opposite positions on the Berlin crisis. One be-
lieved that negotiation must go on, and that we might in
fact have to withdraw from Berlin; one felt that negotia—
tion was no longer possible.

We have never encountered a professor who made an
editorial remark iii class that he did not identify as just
tliati The problem among some of our population seems to
be a lack of perception in distinguishing the editorial re—
mark from the interpretive remark. Such problems as the
“Forum" mentions arise, not from increased editorializing
on the part of the professor, it would seem, but ratller, from
the laziness of the student who does not carefully investi-
gate the pertinent classroom material. We must remember
that few significant faculty changes have been made in the
last four years to warrant the strange reaction \vliicliisnow
occurring. Furthermore, never in all our four years at Grinv
hell, have we rilii into a classroom situation wllere all views
were not given “equal time". We have seen papers pure
porting positions on the right and positions on the left re-
ceive D‘s and we have seen both kinds of papers receive A's.

It is true, of course, that there are those students and
faculty with political views which might be easily located,
either to the left or right of center, and we are by no
means suggesting that people become wisliyewashy or silent
about their beliefs. What we object to are those few care-
less critics who refuse to remember that there are countless
pigeonholes within the pigeonlioles alid beliefs within be-
liefs, and that there are Vast unexplored areas of thought
which can hardly be accounted for by only one or two
names which we have hardly begun to define.

What lies behind this tendency to label is the apparent
need to escape the comple. ties of our 20th Century exis—
tence, by seeing everything as either black or white, and
imagining our world as a place where good guys and bad
guys are the only inhabitants. We cannot escape reality so
easily without doing ourselves grave harm. The world
is not that simple, and we must face its challenges honestly,
and carefully. We must re-considei‘ our labels and accusae
tions. People are just not plum preserves.

Burkle Describes Japanese College

Ed. Note: For those of you
who are new to the Grinnell
campus, Howard it, Biirklc,
professor of philosophy and
religion, is presently on leave
from (ii-iiiiicll, spending time
at International Christian Uni-
versity in Tokyo. What follows
is a recent letter from Burklc
giving some of his observa—
tions and insights into the en-
vironment of the Japanese
university.

by Howard Bui-klc

We thought that it might be
of some inicrcst to Grinncll
students to hear something
about their couiilci-pnrts in this
Japanese univcrsiiy, particularly
ihcii- thinking on recent inlei»
national events.

Since the Japanese school
bcpins iii the spring. the fall
term is only a continuation of
the current school year and
therefore lacks the quality of
freshness which surrounds the
opening of school in the USA.

Here the books have already
been bought, the courses long
ago registered for and the
merits of this year‘s freshman
class (the best in history . . .
only those from the upper lcn
pei cent of their classes, etc.)
have been sung. Out of phase,
we Americans came upon ilic
dinina already in progress.

Yet there is something new
in the pic. The Russian deci-
sion to resume nuclear test-
ing and the American decision
to follow suit struck sharply
at campus nerves, The Julia»
iiese never for a moment let
you forget that they alone
have experienced the destruc-
tion of nuclear explosion.

All political poi-ties are united
in their open and explicit op.
position to the manufacture,
testing or use of nuclear weap-
ons. Even the Communist party,
which is a tiny minority usuak
ly loyally approving whatever
tllc Soviet Union is doing, felt
compelled to express regret at
this Soviet decision. All of‘ this
kccps the Japanese public aglr
tated They are not hysterical,
noi- wildly aroused, but they
are. as one columnist i~cccntly
put it. inﬁnitely sad.

The ICU students, like most
Japanescsiudcnis, are discuss-
ing World problems \t'lih great

enthusiasm and the boundless
desire to do something to make
their voices heard. They i-e—
membci- quite vividly ihc del'nr
onstrations and riots — largely
student led which occurred
at the limo of Eisenhower’s
scheduled visit.

Some of them wci-c in on
these demonstrations, and they
are proud of men part; houu
ever, ihcy ai-c wary lost their
choirs now be seized and nin—

.nipulated—as they won then—

by destructive forces bent on
blind violence.

There is pent-up frustration
among Japanese students and a
large measure of ethical root-
lessness because of the utter col-
lapse of thell‘ previous ruling
powers and the disintegration of
its system of values. For in
sance, nearly 70Vper cent of ihe
present lcu student body de-
scribes itself as having no slice
glance to any religious body in
tradition.

Thus, the sentiment against
nuclear armaments mun-ms
the stature of n national i-e»
ligious conviction; it is a ml-
lying point for the open sup-
port oi the one value on
which all Japanese today
agree.

All of this provides the back-
ground for lCU’s particular cone
tributlon. One of the members
of the freshman class is Ted
Reynolds, son of Dr. Earle L.
Reynolds, the skipper who in
1958 sailed his ship, Phoenix,
into the U.s. Paciﬁc testing
grounds to protest the testing
of hydrogen weapons there.
As you have noticed if you've
read the papers closely, the Rey»
holds family has recenily sailed
from Hiroshima, whcie ihcy now
live. to Vladivostok, to protest
lhc Russian resumption of icsi.
ing. The Reynoldses' son after
long deliberation, decided to
join his family despite the like-
lihood of their being im oned
for entering without a Visa. or
on some more serious charge.

The ICU siudenfs held an
all-school convocation and for.
inulnted ii resolution support—

which every attitude and move-

NELL SCARLET AND BLACK. The new drycleaniiig ser—
vice is amazing. Just toss in an arm load of clothes, insert
six quarters, and the machine (you use your own machine)
whirls gently and quietly through a 45-minute clean and
dry cycle. You can actually watch your clothes being claim-
ed through a window in the door. The new “Village” is pro-
viding complete laundry and cleaning service to the public.
The coinvopcl'ntcd dryulellning iliiit will clean anything trom

Housewives will be able to do both laundry and or cleaning
at the new Laundry and Cleaning Village in a single visit. _

The (li'ycleﬂning machines clean eight pounds of garments
(8 to 10 dresses) in approximately 45 minutes i . . for only
$1.50. The dl'yclcancr provides it means for the Consumer to

Thai Girls Show Disciplined Behavior,
Hide Sense Of Humor With Shyness

by Gretchen Schiele

Since the middle of June i
have been living here in Bang<
1:01: at Wattana Wittaya Acad-
emy, an old and respected girls'
boarding school. it resembles
a rustic estate surrounded by
lawns of rich green grass.
cause it was the ﬁrst girls
school in Thailand, the people
here are especially proud of its
history.

There are several elderly
teachers who remember the days
when Wattana was in the coun.
try and students paddled miles
tip the klong (canal) to reach
it. Today it is in the city and
its undisturbed klongs are cov-‘
ercd with lotus blossoms and
other plants.

Teaching English to girls trorn
10 to 18 at Wattana and at
Jones Hayes, an overcrowdedl
school in the lieait of the Chi-l
nese section of Bangkok, has‘,
been interesting and rewarding:
d got my ﬁrst impressions
Thai girls from their classroom
behavior, which reflects lllelr‘
disciplined upbringing. respect
for teachers and careful atten-
tion to formalities.

lt is not. as i had thought, a
joke that in Thailand people,
keep their heads lower than‘
yours to show their respect. Be—,
cause of my height this is no
problem for my students un—
less I am seated at my, desk.
Then they will drop on their
knees—a custom which makes,
me wince a little.

I am still a little bafﬂed
by the students sense of hu-
mor and shyness. They some-
times fail to appreciate stories
that I had thought would
amuse them but are tickled
by little comments or facial
expressions that I make with~
out even realizing it. The ex—
treme shyness along with the
classroom formality creates a.
special problem in my older
classes where 1 am supposed
to work on English conversa-
tion.

The best single opportunity 1
have had for seeing my Wat—
tana students in an informal
situation was at a Chl‘istiani
Youth Fellowship retreat at a
camp site on the Gulf of Siam.
One fourth of these students
were Christian This percentage
is only a little higher than that
of the school, even though it is
a Christian school. For these 46
girls, a retreat of this kind was
a new experience. They were
eager for a good time away
from the boarding school rou-
tine,

Outside the city a few kilom-
eters our overloaded bus wit
temperamental brakes broke
down, and we were stuck for
rour hours at a garage and a
rundown little country store.
Having spent a number of sum-i
mers as a camp counselor at,‘
home and taken American girls
on similar excursions, I knew
well what a nightmare a delay
like this could be. Rather than
complain or cause me any con—
cern, these girls seemed con.
tent to talk, sing. drink social
pop and walk around from one
shaded spot to the next. I was
probably the most worried and
uncomfortable one there.

. We finally arrived in camp,‘
and when i came to the Cablnl
which I was to share with eight
of my students, they seemed
excited and happy to have their
“teacher" staying with them.
They promptly pounded and
tested each bed to see which
was the most comfortable. Oil
course, they offered me thel
shower ﬁrst, but I preferred (ill

Although it is not the best

friend has little choice; he has
only 12 short days in London,

labout these famous spots would
ibe utter foolishness, not to say
a waste of his money.

But he has a chance, if he
wishes, to sec and even partake
in one of the most curious and
‘chaineleonic institutions of man
—alld this is the Chance of the
public bar, known as the Pub.

. this presents a monumental
i problem, tiinewise that is, be-
cause it takes time to become
familiar with this strange

time to observe the Pub

t cral stages as its patronscomc

Because the Pub lsoriented to

Englishman (they are two sepae
rate races, you understand)
might both agree that a ‘pl‘opel"
lPub is not to beicund in down-

it has its regular customers, yet
close enough to attract seine of
ithe city characters, dissidents
and students.

Even though these Pubs might
lack somc of the country au—
thenticity, the American who is
lused either to the brightly
.lit llqour stores of New York, or
,to the dully lit (but also expen-
sire)
should discover many surprising
and even pleasing things.

The only unwelcome part
,about the pub might be the
change in the actual liquid re-
freshment (known to the Grins
nell world as ice Cream) from
passable Budweiser to giiastly
guinesscs, awesome ales and
stiﬂing stouts, particularly when
served warm, as they are in at

But the more political ques-

in for a bit of refreshment, of
lcitwingors to discuss policy ov—
er a game of darts and of frus-

But whatever may be said, the
