Infrequent rumors of peace ne-

Wall Street‘s explanation
tor this pattern recalls one oi
the major objections to the
war by dove politicians H
that in our concentration on
the Vietnam conilict, we are
neglecting worsening domes-
tic strains.

As a result. of our tremendous
expenditures on the war, the
nation is suffering an increased
balance or payments deiicit and
expanding inﬂation, The eco-

danger anticipated by investors
at the moment, according to
The Wall Street Journal.

Some Wall Street investors
predict that stock prices would

there be a peace settlement.
Their reasoning is that gov-

I—BUCKLEY RAPS FEDERAL BUDGET

By Wm. F. BUCKLEY, Jr.
5&8 Staff Writer
Mrr Wilbur Mills, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, is being held re

sponsible ior having forced upon President Johnson some of those economies reﬂected in the Bud-
get.

Nothing dire, but it does add up, or rather cut down: fewer new merchant ships, fewer new
buildings on college campuses, iewer free boolu lor the schools, a little less reclamation, fewer
new federal buildings, quite a little retrenchment in the space program, 2 little less agricultural con~
servation, the toregoing adding up to about a billion dollars. You would think, to judge irom the
apparent weeping and gnashing or teeth within the White House, that every one or those dollars was
a pet.

The quid pro quo is supposed to be the new sunax.

Everybody is supposed to he in tavor of the new suriax, which would bring in twelve-billion dol-
lars in additional revenue, reducing the projected detieit irom twenty-billion to eightrbillion.

The surtax is defended by much of the conservative community simply because it takes us in
the direction of a balanced budget, and almost anything that does, the conservatives tend [0 think
of as a step in the right direction, The liberals iavor the surtax because they are beginning to fear
(high time) the results of runaway inﬂation, both politically and intellectually; because they ap~
prove the graduated nature of the onus — the surcharge accentuates the progressive ieatures ot the
income tax.

It is a pity that the liberals didn‘t show a concern for unbalanced budgets earlier in the history
at the republic.

And of course even now we are continuing to add to the national debt, so that iiscal 1911] will
show an increase in the cost of debt service.

. And so the taxes rise and rise, and get more and more complicated. At this point, a commuter
to New York City who resides in Connecticut, linds himseli paying a property tax at home, a com-
muter tax in New York City, a state tax to New York State, on top of the federal income tax. Every
one of these taxes is in the process of being raised White Collar workers in New York City are
worse on this year even if Ihey received a live per cent salary raise at the turn oi the year: it you
count, and you must, the rise in the social security payments, the projected rise in the income tax,
federal and state, and the rise in the cost of living. oiiicially put at 3% but much, much more
titan that in many of the cities.

What shall we propose for the Democratic Pladnnn of 19687 Subsidies for the middle class?

There is a lot of talk about the loopholes How much money could be saved here, there, and
elsewhere, it only loopholes a, b, and c, were closed up. It is seldom observed that loopholes in
America, like black markets in Soviet Russia, are the cracks through which the electricity charges
the system.

If, for instance, the effective rate of taxation were as high as the 77% now proposed — or
had been as high as the 91% of a few years ago — the prosperity necessary to finance the Great
Society‘s jumbo budgets would simply not exist.

Reflection on the taxes, the loopholes, the deductions, the ellipses, the sheer Crushing complex-
ity of it. all brings to mind the quiet Sanity of such as Professor Milton Friedman, with his stress
on simplicity, and disentangllng taxes for revenue for piutophobia.

Dr. Friedman begins by observing that existing deductions for children are wildly unrealistic
and should be instantly doubled. Then he favors the elimination] of all exemptions.

Then — brace yourself — he calculates that a uniform rate of 19% would yield as much rev-
enue as the crazy graduated rates with the exemptions and the loopholes and the rest of it. Throw in
his negative income tax and even then you would go no higher than 25% tax.

And if you were to deduct from the cost of living the tax accountants and tax lawyers, no longer
necessary, who knows what a rise there would be in the general afﬂuence, perhaps even suilicient
to return to poor Mr. Johnson the merchant marine ships, the school buildings, and the tederal
buildings that bad Wilbur Mills has taken from himi

 

Cay Nineties Ads

“Caiurrh Cure"
“Fresh Lettuce”

“Tonsoriul Baths"

Ever since Satan made tho
first plug for one or nature's
most perfect products, the me
dium and the message have been
prodding man's passage to Par-
idise Regained.

However, the dervlshes a!
profit have never attained the
graceful [arm and pristine ele-
gance they captured during
these wonderful ﬁscal years—
the Gay Nineties in Grinnell.

For those plagued with phy-
sical fitness fetishes, a copy
of the 1890 5&3 carried this
guarantee —- “We offer one
hundred dollars reward for
any case oi catmali that can-
not be cured by Hall‘s Catnrrlt
Cure — 75 cents a bottle.”

in the unlikely case the catarrti

cure tailed, local merchant-
tempted readers in subsequent
issues with the only medically
proven packaged panacea for
uncured catarrh —- “Tonscrial
Baths — Especially Fine for
the Ladies"

Foliage seemed in be the
major agency promotion dur-
ing the period, and Grimel-
liens were exposed to such
Vegetable verbage as ”Fresh
Lettuce at Hulsizer’s Green-
house ioi- Thanksgiving,” and
“At the Met, Jonathan Eat-
ing Apples."

Unfortunately, even in the best
or capitalistic times, somebody
has to lose in the free market.
But as a wiseman once said,
entrepreneurs never die, they
merely switch lines; and the
58:3 was proud to print their re-
vived message —- “Order hacks
for Concerts or parties.”

Within the confines of any great metropolitan
newspaper building, an offensive campaign is con-

stantly being waged by the advertising department
against the men on the copy desks. Or so it seems.

Editors beat their heads together trying to
place well-written stories on pages full of horrible
ads in such a way that the stories will be read. And
business managers, apparently, try every day to
find ads more gargantuan and more offensive to
out-shine the copy desk’s copy.

That, anyway, is one problem.

Another comes about when each individual
page is put into the entire newspaper. Some nation-
nl advertisements cannot be placed on the same
page or even on the page opposite an ad for com-
peting companies.

Some ads have coupons, and cannot be placed
on the other side of a page that has an ad with I
coupon.

Some ads are so grotesque you don’t want to
put them anywhere.

There are local advertisers who are constntly
trying to bribe ad men to bribe business managers
to put their ads on the front page of the newspaper.

"Pagliai’s wouldn’t want it’s ad next to Ahr-
vano’s, but if we move Ahrvanos over to that page
and put Poynter’s next to Pagliai's that puts Poyn-
ter’s next to Bang’s and we can’t have that

“. . . Maybe we can move that New York Univer-
lity job ad over to page four. No, that would put it
next to a University of Chicago job ad. But we
can’t leave it there because it cuts the heart out of
our best story. 0h, damn, can’t we just junk these
damn ads?”

No, we can’t — at least not frequently. If we
'do we might not get any more ads, and ads make
up around $350 or something like thirty percent of
our operating budget.

“Like it or not,” says Steve Warsh, business
manager of the Scarlet & Black, “the costs of pub-
lishing a newspaper are higher than ever. To meet
these rising costs, newspapers from New York to
San Francisco are finding it necessary to solicit
more and more advertising. The Scarlet & Black is
no exception to this trend.”

“We operate on a shoe-string budget. Our re-
sources are limited as is our publishing flexibility.
Financially and physically, we cannot afford to put
out a 16 or 20 page paper every Friday of the school
year.”

“Unfortunately, no matter how much advertis~
ing we sell, we can‘t cover the cost of an average
issue,” Warsh added, “We need to dip into our sub-
scription and SGA allotment funds.”

"Our answer to these restrictions has been
fewer, but larger issues. “In this way, we hope to
accomplish the twin task of bringing you the
“news” and still retaining our financial stability.”

Both journalistically and financially, we hope
to please the bitchegoddess success.

The present Ind-war semi.
melt among investors is a
reversal of earner mullet
reaction In Ihe var.
when America’s ﬁrst major
military buildup began in Viet-
nam, early in 1965, American
investors ielt that large mili-
lary expenditures would revlm-
lize an economy they lemd
was going sluggish.

In July, 1965. the Dow Jones
industrial: were at a level of
about ﬂsl points. By February
ll, 1566, Dow Jones industrial:
reached the historic high of
995.15 points.

Dow Jones and Company —
the publisher All “I Vlnll Strut
Journal — oomputu its in-
dustrial average by selecting
thirty representative, major in-
dustrial corporations, watching
Khieil' daily prices, Ind mulling
the prices of their common
leek.

Roughly speaking, when the
Dow Jones "my: lor indus-
trials decline: by a point. it
means ill-t the total —- repw
senting the total price of one
share each for these thirty
Dump-hie: — has declined by a
dollar.

Buying activity lncunsed
with Gaul-don. Rumors of
peace talks would occasion
selling by investors.

Market activity now operates
in the opposite pattern.

on January am, Dow Jones
Industrlals‘ went up 7.73 points
to a level of 908.92 with reports
that North Vietnam was consid-
erlng peace talks. When the re-
ports did not materialize, prices
began to drop.

By Febmary 13th, the indus-
trials decreased 77.15 points
from January. closing at 831.77.

Despite a small recovery. the
market again declined with ru-
mors that Johnson was consid-
ering an increase in our troop
commitment in Vietnam.

The March 5th closing level
of Dow Jones Industrial: was
330.56, a 14—month low.

The investors overwhelming
{ear with American involvement
in Vietnam is that the deterior-
aling internal economic situation
will bring about Government
wagerprice controls and cause
a reducllon in corporate prof-
its.
