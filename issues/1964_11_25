Faculty Committee Arts On Rules
Violation l) y South Younlrer Ilull

A series of events the past
week has led to the members
of South Younker hall being
placed on conduct probation.
The action was taken by the
Faculty Committee on Student
Affairs, in a unanimous deCis-

ion, following the hall’s admis-
sion that it violated the college
alcoholic beverage regulations
on the evening of Nov. 3.

Weekend of Uncertainty. Turmoil
For Student Government Officials

The South Younker Decision
from the Committee on Student
Affairs brought on a period of
crisis among student govern-
ment officials as they probed
among themselves and with
members of the administration
the possibility of major changes
in administration policy toward
rules and their enforcement
during-a hectic series of meet-
ings throughout: the last week»
end.

Spearheading the movement
to find out what was going on
and what it meant to the stu-
dent body were Phil Johnson,
Student Government President,
and Jim Parkison, Speaker of
the Senate. Coming out of a
meeting Friday afternoon with
Waldo Walker, Associate Dean
of the College, and 5. Eugene
Thompson, Dean of Men,
Johnson and Parkison said that
they detected attitudes that to
them warned of an impending
“crackdown" by the adminis-
tration in rule enforcement and
some sweeping changes in the
relationship between adminis-
trative enforcement action and
that on the student level.

In meetings with students on
Friday night and Saturday they
elaborated on their basic fears:
that college officials no longer
felt that monetary fines were
useful deterents and that in-
stead the only effective penal-
ties are conduct probation,
suspension, or dismissal; that
the student deans will take any
cases of rule violations which
come to their attention to the

mained was administrative and

investigations and talks among
all people concerned through-
out the week-end revealed that
much had been the result of
misunderstanding, emotion, ex-
aggeration, and what one of-
ficial called "opinion monger-
ing."

in its oWn effort to determine
what was happening, the Scarlet
and Black spent a large part of
the weekend contacting members
of the administration and members
of the FCSA, as wall as student
leaders.

of the hall who were in no way
involved in the event or its
planning, was being presented
to the Committee.

The events of the week start-
ed when the Dean of Men and
the Associate Dean of the col-
lege received an anonymous
letter stating that on the even-
ing of Nov, 3, (election night)
South Younker hall had sold
hamburgers, pop, and beer in
their clubroom. (This action
violated the college alcoholic
beverage regulation because it
involved consumption of beer
in the clubroom and the sell-
ing of it to minors.)

Upon receipt of the letter, the
Dean of Men began investiga-
tions which led to the hall‘s ad-
mission nhat the party was
held, that it was voted upon and
passed by the house council,
and was passed by the majority
of those attending a regular
house meeting at which it was
discussed. It was planned as a
fund raising function. The hall
made about $15.00 on it.

The letter itself did not lead
to the matter being taken to the
FCSA, but to investigations
which substantiated parts of rho
letter and disproved other
parts. The violation explained
above was the matter that was
taken to the committee.

On Monday evening, Nov, 16,
the Dean of Men attended the
South Younker housemeeting
and explained that the action
could not go unpunished. At
that time the hall made it clear
that the responsibility for the
event was the hall‘s and the
punishment should be meted
out to the hall, rather than to
the individuals who were di-
rectly responsible for the buy-
ing and selling of the refresh-
ments and the planning of tho
details.

On Thursday evening the
Dean of Men agaln attended a
meeting of the hall, and an-
nounced the decision of tho
FCSA to them.

At the time that the hall ad-
mitted responsibility for the vi-
olations of the college regula~
tions regarding alcoholic bev-
erages, some of the members
of the hall said that they were
aware that the probable penal-
ty would be individual conduct
probation for each member of
the hall, other memberi of tho
hall said that they thought the
probable penalty would be so-
cial probation for the hall
(which would involve the freak

As We See If .V . .

The hurried week-end of meetings and so-called “news-
breaks” has kept members of the Scarlet and Black staff on
the run. Our first and last intention was to give our readers
a comprehensive view of what had occurred without dealing in
the extensive realm of emotion or supposition. Pressed by an
early publication date due to the holiday this week, we are at
this time unable to comment in full in any analysis of events,

' nor are we even sure that such commentary is necessary. We
feel that we have given the students and the administration a
fair representation in our news columns. We are now waiting
to see what might further develop. For the time being we will
stand as follows:

The Committee on Student Affairs acted within its juris-
diction when lt dealt with the South Younker case. Likewise,
members of student government acted in good faith in their
attempts to achieve what they considered the fullest measure
of justice for the students involved in the penalty. We do not
at this time see any need for alarm concerning the administra-
tion’s possible usurpation of student government powers. In
the event of a future crack-down on rule enforcement at the
college, we can- see the role of student government changing,
but we would not necessarily object to such a change. To those
students most directly involved, with due respect for their
honest concern with serving their fellows to the best of their
ability, we would only issue a reminder that they are still
Itudents, with an educational objective that does not include

running the college.

ICARLET AND ILACK

To the Editor:

Do you suppose a mossy, ex-
Grinnell jock (non - intellectual
type) would dare engage Paul
Trigg in an academic discourse re-
garding his November lath Scarlet
Fever article? l'm wondering if
such former Grinuell lettermen as
Gar Smith, Dick Orchard, Kirk
VanRoyan, Denny Asby, Bill Par-
sons, Bob Musser, etc. are of the
non-academic type athletes Paul
Trigg is talking about? it is hard
for me to believe that these indi-
viduals (and I can think of many
more) were the hon-intellectual
jock' variety when they arrived on
campus; possibly, during their on-
suing 'stay at Grinnell, they be-
came intellectuals?

Let us take the Championship
1960-61 basketball squad as an ex-
ample, According to my personal
knowledge (1 did get to know most
of them personally) about to per
cent of them went on to acceptable
graduate schools. ls thisnonAaca-
demic image? Could these Honor
G athletes be of the jockrimage
Coach Bowers and the School Bul-
letin purport to convey to the gen-
eral public? Following Grinnell
football rather closely these past 4
5 years now, becoming acquainted
with most of the squad members as
I have, i would hazard a guess
that something less than l per cent
(and I believe you will find even
Carleton with the same percent«
age) of these squad members
might be classified in the ‘Trigg’
category of questionable, Honor 6,
image-type athlete. Possibly Paul
Trigg's definition of non-intellectual
lock is different than mine.

Regarding the geographical syn-

opsis: in looking over a Carleton
1962-63 basketball program, find
over 75 per cent of their squad
from the states of Minnesota and
Illinois. Coach Young’s 1963 track

roster reveals 32 athletes listed, 11
states represented and 12 members
from the state of laws. Maybe
trackmen aren’t considered in the
lock category? Or has anyone seen
soul-rent Lawrence football roster
and noticed the people from the
state of Wisconsin? (Yes, I think
most academicians would consider
Lawrence in the same class with
Carleton and Grinnell). Living as
close to Northfieid, Minn. as l have
these past two years and being
somewhat alert to Midwest Confer-
ence athletic activities, i am more
acquainted with the Carleton ath-
letic image and their recruiting
practices (i use the term loosely).

Despite the fact that Grinnell has
a ‘Special interests‘ man in their
admissions office, lbelieve you will
find little or no difference in the
two schools approach to prospec-
tlva high school students be it ath-
lete or otherwise. By the way, be
sure and notice a rather talented,
rangy sophomore center on this
year’s Carleton basketball team;
he comes from (all places!) Cros-
by—lronton, Minnesota, and I as-
sure you he was courted and
lunched just like any 800 board-
score prospect. Wonder if we
should question Carleton (our
chief academic rival) or whether
scholarship or admission was
granted on strictly academic
grounds?

functions for a long period of

 

 

time).

The provisions for conduct
probation, as stated in the Stu-
dent Handbook are as follows:

"Conduct probation is a rec-
agnition of general lack of co-
operation in citizenship, or the
breaking of some specific rule.
The terms of this probation are
defined in each case by the ad-
ministrative ofﬁcials imposing
the probation penalty.

“This probation is a warning
that severe discipline will be
imposed if a student is again
reported for a similar lack of
cooperation or for violation of a
social rule of the college.”

In the case or South Younker,
the provisions of the probation
will be the following. A letter
announcing the probation will
be sent to the student and his
parents, and will be placed in
the files of the student in the
Dean’s office. The members of
the hall who hold campus of—
fices will be allowed to keep
them. The period of probation
will continue until June 4, 1965,
at. which time the letter will he
removed from the files. The
probation in no way affects a
student’s permanent record. it
does, however, mean that a
major violation of the rules of
the college during this time

would place him under consid-
eration for suspension.

The Dean of Men explained
that this penalty was felt by the
committee to rest heavily on
”those who are accident
prone," and have little or no
effect on those students who
make it a habit to obey the col-
lege rules anyway. He ex-
plained that the college has to
provide a deterrent for gross
violations, and that with this
action by the FCSA, "the word
is informally out that the col-
lege stands ready to dismiss
students, if necessary, for
gross violations of its rules."

“There is no such thing as
hall responsibility in the ab-
stract sense,” he said the com-
mittee decided. “It's always
people's violations," Ha furth-
er explained that this particu-
lar penalty was felt to be the
“only way of designating re-
sponsibility to the people there
rather than to the hall as a
theoretical concept. Fining the

hall is not a good way to dis- ‘ ‘

charge the social responsibility.
Removing s o c i 31 privileges
wouldn‘t fill the educational
purpose of a penalty."

Letters to the Editor
Parents Reply lo Trigg on ‘Non-lnlelleclual Jock'

To the Editor:

As a parent of an athlete at
Grinnell, I feel compelled to reply
to Mr. Trigg's column in the No-
vember 13 issue, attacking the
Grinnell athletes. i am trying to
be restrained in my reply, hoping
that Mr. 'i‘rigg was writing with
tongue-incheek, but I am desper-
ately afraid he was not. His ooh
umn carries the wistful hope that
Grinnell is somehow, in some mam
ner, comparable to Carleton, No
amount of hoping will change the
awful truth.

i am also a parent of a recent
Carleton graduate and athlete. The
second son, although welcomed to
Carleton because of respectable
College Board scores unfortunately
(in my opinion) chose Grinnell, He
received no scholarship, no aid, no
nothing. He is still receiving noth-
ing. Nothing in educational com-
petence and nothing in leadership
guidance or support either from
the administration or from his col-
leagues.

Mr. Trigg believes that Grinnell
would be improved by a larger per-
centage of lowa’s com-fed, 800 plus
College Board-students. Mr. Trigg
is wrong. Grinnell is suffering and
suffocating from its present 600
to 700 plus students from the great
com state. The school, the Scarlet
and Black, the students and the
administration already have too
much com, Harvard, Yale, Prince-
ton, Stanford and others seem to be
surviving with a fair supply of ath-
letes from lilinois.(as well as other
states) who, in addition to being
able to discipline themselves suf-
ficiently to participate in athletics,
also have l.Q.'s comparable to the
best “hybrids” from Iowa.

If Grinnell has any future, and
after seeing it sag for three years
i doubt if it has, it lies in those
students who meet its undeservedly
high academic standards and still
have time and desire enough to
want to have some physical compe-
tence and competition. Carleton
and the other good schools seem to
recognize this. Even the University
of Chicago, my aima mater.
learned the same thing, the hard
way.

He went on to clarify the pur-
use of the FCSA, listing them as
allows: “1) to advise the President
.t policies, procedures, rules, and
-nalltles In the area of student
onduct and discipline; 2) to par-
' ipate in the process of changing
lasic rules and penalties in the
tea of student conduct and disci-
line; 3) to consider and decide
ases within its purview and, under
ppropriate conditions, to review
ts decisions. In its function of ad-
udiCiatlng Cases, the Committee
as duties specified in the legisla-
lon of the Faculty (approved by

e President) establishing the
ommittee," (see story on Com-
l ittee with list of duties.)

Dean of Women Jean M. Slocum
enled that there was any attempt
n the part of the FCSA to usurp
tudent government power. “The
ddition of the committee Is a re-
urce to handle sticky problems
at are overburdening the stu-
ents,” she said on Monday. “It is
reated to help the college solve
e problems. I would hate to have
tudents look at it as only one
hing —— a substitute for student
oveniment. It is not Created to
e a student court."

On request of the 5&3, Associate
Dean Walker made a statement of
is own opinions on certain mat-
ers, emphasizing that it did not
ecessarily reflect the belief of the
CSA. His statement followsl

“I feel that some students may
ave the attitude that on occasion
epresentatives of the College

othing could he further irom the’

hould be to provide the opportun-
ies for students to advance them-
elves academically, culturally, and
ocially. The success of the col-
egc iaculty and udministration,can
nly be measured by its ability to

unreasonable for 6 College to as-
sess students for rules violations h
a monetary penalty when thaCo -
legs is contributing financial aid to
many of these same students to
enable them to attend Grinneil. I
also feel that monetary lines do
not serve as a good deterrent
against future violations.

"I would hope that Grinnell
might succeed in teaching its stu-
dents that to participate in un-
Controlled, or irrational mass ac-
tion is participation in the worst
type of coniormism. I further
believe that when a person re-
sponsible ior a breach of college
regulations is sought he should not
be able to hide behind the anony-
mlty of a group or ‘hall', Irrespon-
sibIe action by an individual is just
as irresponsible ii he does it with
a group oi 100 or ii he does it
alone. Thus, 1 believe that j
responsible action by an indivi
ual or a group oi individuals
should be met with penalties that
will deter future ' espnnsible ac-
tIon; i,c., each individual should
receive the penalty ior his own
action.”

As a new week dawned on cam
pus, the various meetings con-
tinued, among them a meeting of
the FCSA to determine new de-
velopments in the South Younlrer
case. (members of the hall are ap-
pealing the penalty as such, asking
that only the guilty be punished,
rather than each member of the
hall.) The Committee has been ap-
proached by the 5&3 with a series
of questions concerning its develop
ment and mechanics, but with the
early press date this week and the
heavy schedule of business for the
committee the story will be held
until a future date. Members of
the committee, headed by J nhn
Burma (sociology) have been

‘ amenable to the 5&3 and express

complete cooperation in efforts to
answer questions that will make
their actions Clearer to the stu-
dent body.

The final outcome of the weekend
talks was an apparent split among
SGA officials. At a joint AWS-
CoIHP meeting, the interpreta-
tions of Johnson and Parkison of
their talks with administration of-
ficials was challenged by other Ex-
ecutive Cabinet members and by
various hall presidents.

Johnson and Parkison, however,
continued to express "confusion
and apprehension" as to the posi-
tion of student government under
what they assume as a new policy
among administration members.

concrete action which can serve as
a definite indicator. rThis indica»
tor might take the form of one of
the following: a final plan for the
North Campus head resident sys-
tem. including their role In rule
enforcement; a definition of the re-
Iationship between the Faculty
Committee on Student Affairs and
the Student Courts; a set oi pro-
cedures and standards of evidence
to be used by the faculty Com-
mittee; whether or not the Com-
mittee qualifies its decision on the
South Younker case; and whether
or not the Committee overrules the
Primary Courts on two pending il-
legal visitation cases.

"Until at least one or these Ic-
tiona occur, or until the college
makes its position known in some
other WAY, we are left in I condi-
tion both confused and very ap-
prehensive."

I have received numerous comments, both pro and con,
on my article of two weeks ago. As a result, I wish to explors
more thoroughl the two major areas of concern: “recruiting
of athletes to érinnell and the "jock image” at Grinnell. I
attempt this hoping to put the problems in their proper pelt
s ective, and also hoping to make my gersonal feelings more
c ear. Realizing this to be too much to andle in one swallow,
I will deal only with the “recruiting” aspect this week, and
save the “image” aspect until next week.

Grinnell competes athletically In the Midwest Conferenc

(for you intellectuals who have turned to the wrong pagel
which, academically speaking, is one of the finest athletic cone
ferences in the country. There are no athletic scholarshi I
and no active recruiting is allowed. By “active recruiting’ i
mean that no school may contact a prospective student-athlete
until that school first hears from the boy. This set of standards
has given the conference an integration of academics and ath-
letics, and a level of competition which is envied by most, It
not all, other conferences in the country.

The above tact alone places Grlnnell among a select
group in the college recruiting circle. In addition to this,
we are one of the top schools academically in the conference,
Because of this, we are considered to be one of the “leaders‘
in the conference; we are, without sounding trite I hope. to
set an example. One, If not the most important, way of doing
this is by coming as close to the “ideal” set up by the con-
ference rules and the bulletin as we can.

The above Information was assumed, apparently erron-
eously, to be common knowledge in my first article. In‘ that
article I was merely suggesting that perhaps we, as an insti-
tution, could more closely meet these standards in away
which would enhance our academic standing with Impairlng
our athletic performance.

In short, has one student been admitted to Grinnell who,
except for his athletic abilities, would not have been? Is there
one student who is being given more money on scholarship
than he merits academically? Are athletics weighed more
heavily than other activities on an application? Any attempt
at answering these questions mils into much controversy;
but if they can be answered in the affirmative, and I think
many students believe they can, then it seems to me that
perhaps this is an area in which Grinnell can improve herself
as a liberal arts institution.

Approves Admissions Study Proposal

By Wayne stengal

Grinneii Student Senate met and
unanimously adopted the proposal
of Dennis Murphy 0! East to form-

ber of high school students and for
broadening and improving admis
sion standards. Before the formal
vote Murphy told of his recent in-
teereW with Nicholas Ryan.

Mr. Ryan told Murphy that the
admissions office receives between
800 and 1,000 applicants 3 year and
thus accepts nearly one half of
those applying. in explaining the
administration’s receptibiiity to the
bill, Mr. Ryan noted that Grinnell
has no representatives on the West
Coast, and would like to receive
about three hundred more well-
quaiiiied applicants per year from
all parts of the country. while ne-
cessarily maintaining the 54 out
of state-Iowa student ratio imposed
by the admissions office.

Also assured at the meeting was
Grinnell's participation in th e
NUSNAS»COF0 (Council of Free
dom Organization) Fast For Free-
dom program on December 3. Un-
der this program students in col.
leges throughout the country vaium
tarily miss a meal, and the money
saved by their college cafeterias
from food expenses for the meal is
contributed to a general fund to
buy dried and nonperishabie food‘
stuffs for Southern families made
indigent due to participation in ci<
Vii rights activities. The materials
are shipped throughout the South
by the Teamsters Union.

Ari amendment added to this pro-
posai at the recommendation of
Jim Hei'zog of Langan directs
Saga, in the event that enough
students participate in the program
to close one dining room, to pay its
non-students employees their reg-
uiai' salaries if they so desire.

Steve Kent, Chairman of the
Course Evaluation and Finance
Committees saw the farmer‘s final
resolutions easily approved.
