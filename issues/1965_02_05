By Tom

The discharging of a .22 caliber
revolver in the basement of Lan—
gan hall has resulted in the dis-
missal of the 'student concerned.

Two weeks ago the Langan sen-
Ior became, as he termed it,
“bombed out of my mind" and shot
two holes in the wall of his room.
one in o trash can in the hall, and
one in the ceiling of another stu-
dent's room.

The student had several guns in
his room at the time, none of which
had been registered with the Dean
of Men as prescribed in Article V.
section 3, of the men's house rules.

After the incident, a meeting
was held by the members of Lan—
gan basement and the student was
offered two alternatives, He could
turn himself over to the Men's
Primary Court, or he could hope
that he would get away with the
shootings by using a cover of si-
lence pledged by the meeting of
Langan basement.

The student chose the latter and
the next day he took his guns off
campus and put them in the care
of a friend,

Jan, 27, 5. Eugene Thompson,
dean of men, went to the student’s
room and stated the lacts that the
dean said he had learned "from a
llalirdozen different sources in the
span of a couple of days."

Dean Thompson told the student
that the Faculty Committee on
Student Affairs would meet that af«
temoon, The dean recommended
that the student begin packing im-
mediately because he wanted the
student out of town that day.

Thompson said that the student
asked for a civil trial where he
could confront his accusel's, but
the dean told him. "Not a chance,
In dismissal it is to the advantage
of all parties concerned to get out

was escorted to the bus station

A Langan hall senior has
been suspended for one month
for appearing in the College
Forum intoxicated and for us-
ing offensive language to the
Forum Director, Mrs. Jewell
Hawk.

The student went to the For-
um last Week in the Company
of several other students, all of
whom apparently had been
drinking, When Mrs. Hawk had
the student escorted out, he be—
gan to use obscene language.

S. Eugene Thompson, dean
of men, termed the incident
“an outrageous way to be-
have." He stated that the sus-
pension came, as all suspen-
sions must, through the Facul-
ty Committee on Student Af-
fairs, and was effective immed»
iaiely, ‘

Thompson said that “there
has been some trouble with
drunks in the Forum.” He
added that the CofHP has pr0<
posed that house presidents be
allowed to handle the problem
by having its members spend
time at the Forum “ushering
out drunks."

“It might help the issue to
have students, rather than non-
students, working on the prob-
lem," Thompson said.

Referring to the suspended
student, Thompson said, “I
don't think he planned the inci—
dent. The student isn‘t a chronic
trouble maker. He just didn't
handle himself well, His sus-
pension is a result of the Whole
affair, not any one aspect."

line for paying the $3 fee to

Faculty Cuts Interim;
Finals Before Vacation

A change in the 1965-116 calendar
that would allow first semester
exams to be completed before the
Christmas recess and that would
eliminate the interim period was
okoyed Monday by the faculty.

According to Acting President
James H. Stauss, all calendar de-
tails have not been iinalized, but
most dates have been set.

New Student Days will be re-
duced to three, from Sept. 3

Behavior Insliluie
Receives $26,935

Grinnell has received a $26,935
grant from the National Science
Foundation for the Iourth Grinnell

Behavior Science Institute.

Scheduled for nine weeks, the in-
stitute will run from Sunday, June
13, through Saturday, Aug. 15, and
will again be directed by Neil D.
Kent (psychology),

A science training program in
experimental psychology for high-
ability secondary school students,
the institute will attract approxi-
mately 48 youths who have com-
peted their junior, but not their
senior, year in high school and
who have good backgrounds in sci-
ence and mathematics,

The institute’s purposes are to
identity secondary students who
have potential for becoming sci-
entists, to accelerate their scholar-
1y development through instruction
by scientists of recognized stature,
and to develop cooperation between
colleges and high schools in in-
creasing the quality of education
in the sciences.

Instruction will be offered by
Kent, D. w. Tyler (psychology),
and visiting scientists in seven
courses not normally offered at the
high school level:

“Philosophy of Science and His-
tory of Experimental Psychology,"
“The Experimental Analysis of Be-
havior," ”Introduction to Psycho-
logical Research," “Descriptive
and Inferential Statistics,” “Sen-
sory Processes,” “Physiological
Psychology,” and “The Psychology
of Leaming."

Lectures will be supplemented by
intensive laboratory work and pro-
grammed learning material. Dun
ing the final two weeks of the ses
sion, students will have an oppor-
tunity to execute an independent
study ot their own design,

The first such program in the
country to be supported by the
N.S.F., the Grinnell Behavior Sci-
ence Institute began in 1962 with
a $20,750 NSF, grant and con-
tinued in 1963 and 1964 with awards
of $24,890 and $28,987.

In its rirst three years, the in<
stitute attracted 132 students from
32 of the 50 states.

 

through Sept. 5. Classes will begin
on Labor Day, Sept. 6

The last day of exams for first
semester will be Dec, 18. The sec-
ond semester will begin J an, 12 af.
ter Christmas vacation, with senior
comprehensive exams being ad-
ministered Jan. 10 and 11. The"
will be no interim period.

No date has been set aside for
the Junior Liberal Arts exam.
Stauss said that continuing study
or the JLA is going on and that ll
the exam is given next year it
will be at the same time as comps.

There will be a two week sprln‘
recess, but no ﬁrm dates (or thh
break have been established.

Commencement exercises will M
held on May 22, Stauss explained
that completing the school year at
this early date might give student!
a break in securing summer Ell'h
ployment.

Under the new schedule, than
will be 14 weeks of classes in tho
ﬁrst semester and my, weeks of
classes in the second term. Tbi‘
amounts to 1% additional old
weeks: the added class time w
take up the slack caused by dropy
ping the interim session.

stauss explained that the interim i

was being dropped because M
faculty feels its disadvantages mu-
weigh its advantages.

Final details of the new calend‘
should be worked out in A coupl‘

St. Olaf Tries Interim; Carleton
to Publish Tasty Literary Digest

By Sara Bey

Two Antioch College seniors have
established a dormitory service to
provide food delivery, laundry ser-
vice, and, most ambitiously, a
scheme to synchronize all the
clocks on campus. The Antioch
Retard writes, “This has never
been done in the memory of mod»
Irn mun."

Beluit College is offering upper-
classmen opportunity to take a tull
term of work during the summer
at the University of Guadalajara,
Mexico, The seminar studies in-
clude two courses in advanced oral
Spanish, one in Mexican art and
architecture, and an independent
study project.

A revised calendar at St. Olaf
College now provides tor a tour-
week interim period. Students
can choose from 96 interim
courses or independent study in
Europe or Mexico.

280 sophomores at St. Olaf will
go on dates picked for them by a
computer. Applicants filled out a
questionnaire previously used at
Iowa State University, comparing
them on 41 different points. At
Carleton College, students are
planning their second Computer
Date Night. They used a two~part

 

questionnaire with a psychological
preference test and a statistical in-
formation section.

erary magazine published by Carle~

SCARLET AND BLACK

“You know," said a recent date, of mine as
she placed a booted loci on the coffee table and
in her tipariilo with her shiny new butane cigar
lighter, “It’s kind of a shame that chivalry is
dead,” She paused to exhale a cloud of acrld
smoke. "I wonder what killed it?"

I responded in my usual sophisticated man-
ner — a long silence broken at length by still
more silence. However, the question did intrigue
me so 1 puzzled over it for several days, The
question intrigued me for several reasons. First,
it was a proiound question and I like to puzzle
over profound-type things. More important, it
intrigued me because it was the first question
this girl had asked me that didn’t. deal With
liquor or sex.

Alter several days I did find the answer to
my date's question. Pneumatic door closers
killed chivalry.

You, of course, know what a pneumatic
door Closer is. it is that clever device at the top
or doors that insures that every door that is
opened is closed, thus maintaining an orderly,
closed—door society. I

Now it is a well known fact in chivalric
circles that the most important part. of being
chivalrous isn‘t throwing your coat on mud
puddles or walking on the outside of the side»
walk so you’ll be the one hit by the mud
splashed by all the horses that run past or
your attitude toward your girl or anything silly
and unimportant like all that. Man, What really
counts is opening that door in front of her. Any
knight in shining armor knows that.

Back in the glorious days of Arthur and
Gwen and the rest of the round table crowd, a
door just hung there on its hinges like a good
door and looked at your Granted the hinges may

and weighed a ton, but at least it didn’t have
one of those hissing, sucking, pneumatic closers
at the top lighting you every inch or the way

The number or budding young knights in
shining armor who've had their ego smashed
beyond repair trying to open such a door sunve«
ly deries human imagination. Nothing is more
humiliating than to stand at one side of a
doorway, place your hand on the door, pus-h,
and have nothing happen. You push again, this
time your hand farther toward the center, and
still nothing, At last, in desperation, your face
red with shame, you push at the middle of the

door where you have better leverage, and you
manage to open the door about a mird of the
way, your arm now effectively blocking the
path at your Lady Fair. Your only recourse is
to walk through the doorway first. And there
you have it, the man going through the doorway
before the woman and chivalry has suffered
another setback.

in a futile attempt to tight these siayers of
knighthood, these empowered doors, I devel-
open what could have been a successful tactic.
As I would approach a door, I would fail about
a step and a hall behind my companion and
then, at the last second, realizing suddenly that
there was a door to be opened, would dash
wildly iorward, arm rigid and extended, and
throw open the door using the force or my sprint
to overcome the pneumatic closer. “Brilliant,"
you say? Not quite.

This system works well until one encoun-
ters a double door. For some reason known
only to the hierarchy of B at G only one door
or every pair is unlocked. You have only to im-
agine a charging Lancelot meeting a locked
doorr Shredded, absolutely shredded my coat,
shirt and arm. Bled, you know, badly.

So now you know why chivalry is dead, it
will remain dead until all doors are once again
treeswinging and unencumbered by the trap»
pings or our modern, industrial society, until
once again they are allowed to close of their
own initiative. Then, and only then, can we re-
turn to those happy days when knighthood was
in newer, so—to—speak.

David Lighthourne —
letters to M other

Although this column is really nothing more than
a chance for my mother to hear from me once a
week, the awful pressures of society are some-
times Just so great that I'm forced to sit down and
set things straight around here. By sheer coincir
deuce, the new Forum is an awiully good target
for a little bit of compulsive intelligence.

The first Lhing that should be pointed out is
that Gtinnell students still don’t have a student
union, "they haven't had one since the old one was
torn down, Temporary facilties were ﬁrst set up
in Main basement and then in that new building
there in front of the library. Someday, mother,
maybe some day . ..

In the meantime, though. there's no need to make
the situation more difficult. If students Want to use
the showroom and window displays in the new
building, they ought to cooperate with the ad-
ministration hirelings who also use the place. On
the other hand, I think it would only be polite lor
the students to be given proper respect.

The [list obvious problem has to do with the grace
and gentility that's running rampant over there.
Please don't. misunderstand me; I think grace and
genrihty has its place in hie, along with golr shoes,
clock bottles, and anything else. Grinnell House

is full of it, and that’s fine with me. What l want
to know is what that has to do With students? There’ll
be plenty or time tor grace and gentility in later
years, when we can‘t ﬁnd anything better to do.
At the moment, however we are presumably con
cerned with more interesting and more important
matters.

Aside rrom all the petty little ways in which pre-
tentious formality has been dropped over there—
dropped like lace handkerchiefs soaked in cheap
perfume — the incident in which a Grinnell student
was suspended from college is of the most interest.

The decision of the dean cannot be criticized, The
student involved directed unmistakably abusive lan-
guage at a lady. The dean or men characterized the
incident as “outrageous," which it was. But it was
also more outrageous than the dean of men has
apparently considered. The incident could not have
occurred in anything but an outrageous situation.

The student was asked to leave the building in a
manner which was both unprovoked and thoroughly
ungentile (please ignore the irony). There was
neither right nor reason for this i concealed in-
sult. It occurs to me that “ludicrous" might have
been a better choice or words in the dean 0! men's
remarks.

Thompson lumbosis
Members of longun

By Jim Herzog

Grinnell's Dean of Men, S. Eu-
gene Thompson, warned the resi
dents ot Langan Hall yesterday
that'any turther damage or rule
disobeyal would bring swift and
massive penalties.

Thompson told members of the

en’s residence hall that “The col-
ege wants a better style of life
than its getting”

He referred to damage and de-
struction of lounge turniture, mis-
use or tire alarms, and drinking,
saying, “It stinks to have a situa—
tion like this on a college campus.”

Thompson said, “People are dis-
gusted by ﬂiis place . . . I don't
trust you to live by the fairly
wretched philosophy you already
have."

Thompson told 35 members of,
the hall of 60 that'there "was no
question about something being
done" He continued "Ii you think
there have been arbitrary actions
before, you haven't seen anything
yet."

“If any more goes on, we just
start shooting people down," said
the Dean. One consideration he
mentioned was putting the entire
hall on probation, with those al-
ready having probationary status
facing even more severe action.

Langan Hall, 'he said, is the
“crummiest place to live on North
campus.

Thompson said he was particular»
1y disturbed by the unwillingness
oi Langan Hail members to report
serious incidents to him, SO that
he could take action.

the incident from several sources.
He said, “It was talked up all
around the campus. Lots of people
knew including several CoiHP
members. They knew the incident
had occurred and they knew who
had done it, but the student was
protected by the students around
im who knew of the incidentl”

Dean Thompson stated, “Some
iaculty members were in favor of
turning the affair over to the Grin-
nell police. I called the station,
without using any names, and
asked about charges and penalties.
The police cited three or tour
charges, each punishable by at
least 30 days. Had the incident OC-
curred some place else in town,
such as a hotel, the student would
have been in considerably more
serious trouble.”

Dean Thompson summed up the
incident and the protection sur-
rounding it as, “Incredible.”

Booth Views Interim Favorably

By Sue Johnson

With the comment that “Interim”
is definitely a misnomer, Protes-
sor Wayne C. Booth stated, “The
highest point of the year should
be this time when you can get free
of instructors and get down to edu-
cation.”

Booth, Dean of the Undergrad-
uate College of the University of
Chicago and Pullman professor oi
English in the graduate depart-
ment, made the above observa»
tions during his stay at Grinnell as
guest lecturer tor the freshman
lecture series. Having worked with
various types of independent study
himself, he was very much in-
terested in Grinnell's Interim, upon
which he feels Grinnell needs to
bmld. He stated that the students
should perhaps be better trained
to study independently, for many
students, unaccustomed to the lack

of supervision and direct pressure, lspent a post-graduate year read-

are incapable of using the time to
good advantage. “The trouble with
American education,” said Booth,
“is that too little attention is given
to building a love or each subject.
The aim of a course should not be
to put in as much as possible, but
to be sure that students will go on
educating themselves in that
area.” Although Booth has com-
plained that his high school and
college education was not rigorous
enough, he acknowledges the fact
that he enjoyed and protlted trom
having enough time to read and
listen to music.

Apparently Booth learned from
his undergraduate work at Brig-
ham Young University and his
graduate work at University or
Chicago how to make the most of
his leisure time. After completing
work on his PhD. in English, he

dation grant and a Guggenheim
year writing literary criticisms. He
then taught ”practically every—
thing" for nine years at Earlham
College, a liberal arts college very
similar to Grinnell, after which he
returned to the University of Chi—
cago as a protessorl In 1961 he
published The Rhetoric of Fiction,
which is an attempt to deal with
a neglected aspect oi criticism oi
ﬁction. That aspect is the whole
dimension of fiction which makes
it able to communicate ettectively
to an audience, rather than the ob-
jective view which tends to ignore
the audience. The book received
the Christian Gauss Phi Beta
Kappa award in 1962 for being the
most distinguished piece or literary
criticism of the year,

Despite the fact that he is still

 

teaching courses and seminars in
literary criticism, forms of the
novel, problems in the critiusm 0i
tiction, and English, Protessor
Booth’s greatest concern is tul-
illling his duties as Dean of the
College, ior undergraduate educa
tion is his basic love. Worried
about the diminishing amount of
fun in undergraduate life, he wants
to work on the problem of pre-
graduate pressures; as he states
it, “A liberal education should be
a time when you are liberated.”

Busy Bulbs Boost Bill

In a notice to faculty and
staff members recently, Vice
President Merritt Ludwig noted
that the school’s electrical bills
have increased from $46,735 in
1960451 to an estimated 387,000
this school year, Ludwig said
that this increase was duel

Brzezinski Analyzes Leadership,
Power, Groups in Soviet Union

By Dick Chady

Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski be-
gan this year’s Rosenfieid lec-
tures on contemporary Russian
affairs by discussing “The
Character of Leadership.”
Brzezinski traced the develop-
ment of Soviet leadership from
Lenin to Kosygin and Brezh-
nev.

Lenin's rule was character-
ized by a “fusion of functions,”
meaning that Lenin accepted
the roles of party organizer,
professional revolutionary, ide<
clogue, and personal ruler all
within himself. His power did
not have an institutional base.
Lenin depended on charisma
for his power.

Those surrounding the first
Soviet leader were all dedicat-
ed fanactics, and Lenin dc-
manded the subordination of all.
He was able to maintain power
by exercising leadership on the
yan‘ety of levels mentioned,
and by his obsession with per-
sonal instead of institutional
power.

Stalin, on the other hand, de-
pended not so much on per-
sonal power as he did politi-
cal leverage, as the party he
came the embodiment of what
is correct. Any charisma he ob—
tained was from the party.

The four bases for Stalin’s
power were the state, the par-
ty, the army, and the secret
police. He ruled by maintain<
ing the proper balances be-
tween these bases, and by bal-
ancing coercion with relaxa~
tion, Stalin’s government then
rested on a “complex web of
cross-controls,” and none was
allowed to develop to challange
his authority.

According to Brzezinski, Stal-
in was able to accumulate pow-
er on the basis of Commitments
to great tasks: coilectivization,
industrialization, the war. All
these tasks led to an expan-
sion of the powers of the party
and its ruler.

Khrushchev was seen as a
transitional figure, under which

BRZEZINSKI—
(Continued on Page a)

By David Lighthourne

“We are likely to see in the So-
viet Union an increasing tendency
for leadership at the top to become
more limited in time," according
to Dr. Zhigniew K. Brzezinski, di-
rector of the Research institute on
Communist Affairs at. Columbia
University.

Speaking at the second of this
year’s Rosenfield Lecture Series,
Brzezinski traced the acquisition of
power in the Soviet Union from
Stalin through Khrushchev, and
pointed to the similarities and dif-
ferences in their emergence to
power. Brzezinski then outlined the
implications of his study with re-
gard to future Soviet power strug-
gles,

The pattern {or acquiring power,
said Brzezinski, has been a gradual
transition in which the future lead-
er starts as an equal among
equals, at the top of the Soviet
hierarchy, then he becomes first
among equals, and finally first
among nonequals. Stalin followed
this pattern, Brzezinski said, rough-
ly from 1923 until 1934. Speaking of
the year 1934 Brzezinski noted,
“Now, terror takes on a physical
violence,” as Stalin was soon to
guarantee his supremacy. Khrush-
chev, likewise, followed this pat-
tern, rising in a much more com-
pressed period equal among equals
in 1953 to a position above his as-
sociates in 1957, Brzezinski said.

“in both cases, Stalin's and in
Khrushchev’s case, we are not
dealing with a skilled organizer
who rose to power on the basis of
a slnlllul manipulation of organiza-
tional devices—which is true in
both cases, but to my mind has
been stressed too much, In both
cases we are also dealing with in4
dividuals who intuitively perhaps,
or consciously, associated them-
selves with the right issues at the
right time. And in politics this, of
course is of the greatest impor-
tance."

Stalin, on the basis of certain ora
ganizatianal devices, as well as
sensing accurately the mood of the
emerging party utficialdom, said

By Glen Ashmon

Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski, in
the final Rosenfield lecture,
shattered the longstanding
concept of Communist Russia
as a totalitarian state whose
leaders are responsible only to
the party. The lecture, “Groups
and Policy Making," distin—
guished three kinds of groups
influencing government policy.

The least influential of these
group Brzezinski termed
“amorphous soci a1 aggre-
gates,” Such aggregates com-
prising the industrial proletarv
lat and the peasantry are unor—
ganized and lack cohesion.
Their power to exert pressure
on governmental policy arises
from the fact that they account
for 40 per Cent of the populav
Lion and are in a positiOn to
slow down production and out
put in protest against unpopu-
lar official policy.

The second class of pressure
groups that Brzezinski acknowl-
edged was the “special interest
group.” Such groups are com-
posed of the literary segment
of Soviet society—some 150,000
scientists, 350,000 physicians,
and the Jewish minority. Spec—
ial interest groups become ac-
tive when policies of the Soviet
interfere with their real or
imagined "rights.”

Finally, Brzezinski recognized
“policy groups” as the most
powerful of the pressure groups.
He explained that policy groups
include nearly 200,000 top g0v~
crnment officials who are not
members of the Central Com-
mittee—commanders of mili-
tary personnel and state minis-
ters. Brzezinski outlined the
following reasons for explain»
ing the influence of policy
groups:

a) Extreme cohesion. Policy
groups are well organized
units such as the military.

b) Strategic location, Policy
groups have offices or branches
in major cities as well as in
the Kremlin itself.

c) Access to top leadership.
Policy groups maintain rela
tions with the Party Secretary
and other officials.

d) Institutional freedom for

the implementation of their
goals.

Concluding his lecture, Brzez«
inski divided Russian leader-
ship into five “Columns” rang-
ing from extreme right wing to
extreme left. The far right col-
umn includes the central party
at large who oppose any
change. They favor a central-
ized economy maintained by
governmental computations and
manipulation as opposed to an
open market system. In the
second right column, Brzezin-
ski included the industrial man-
agers who are happy with the
economy as it stands.

Occupying the center position

are groups who favor any sta-
bilizing policy. Party Secre-
tary Leonid Brezhnev was
placed in this column.

Brzezinski included Khrush-
chev in the first left hand col-
umn along with students and
scientists. Finally, on the ex-
treme left are those economists
who favor a free market sys-
tem modeled after the Western
system.

in summary, Brzezinski stat-
ed, “The Soviet Union is no
longer governed on the basis
of single will, single party. The
party itself is no longer a co-
hesive organization but is torn
by conflicting goals."

Brzezinski Discusses leadership

(Continued from Page 5)

a partial division of functions
occurred. He became a “gen-
eralist" and sought to integrate
the party and the Russian so»
ciety as a whole, or to “estab<
Iish a sense of personal rela—
tions” between the government
and the people

And because Khrushchev be-
came more popular with the
masses than the party elite
(whom he embarrassed) he be-
came an anachronism. The
Khrushchev style did‘nol fit the
Stalinist system,
geared to simple priorities and
not Do the jurisdictional Con-
flicts occurring under Khrush-
chev. He had come to power
by beating the reformist Mal-
enkov. However, Khrushchev
later realized “that to make
the Soviet system more depend<
able he had to make it less
totalitarian.”

According to Brzezinski, the
new generation signifies the
first qualitative change in So-
viet leadership in 30 years and
the close of the Stalinist period,
All the new leaders are men
younger than Khrushchev
whose “careers developed in
a wholly institutional frame»
work.”

Khrushchev had risen in fluid
days of little cohesion between
institutions, while the new lead—
ers rose in the 305 and 405 are
professional bureaucrats. They
are “individuals interested in
orderly procedures."

which was.

 

It was precisely these pro-
fessional party bureaucrats who
saw Khrushchev as a threat be‘
cause he reached out to society.
One event that upset the bu-
reaucrats was an enlarged
meeting of the Presidium to
legislate priorities for consum-
er goods. This was an obvious
conflict with the professional
party bureaucrats, who “are in-
terested in preserving the pri-
macy of the party.”

The new leaders are charac-
terized by bureaucratic profes-
sionalism; they are more paro-
chial than the leaders of 30
years ago who were interna-
tionally minded. Because the
new elite is provincial and nar-
row~minded, it can understand
neither the need for sharing nor
an international spirit.

The Soviet system is now the
first to be run and headed al-
most entirely by bureaucrats,
while most systems allow for
the introduction of non-bureau-
cratic blood, even at the top.
The important question now is
”Can an ideologically oriented
bureaucracy be the basis for
innovation and change?” Can
those who advance on the basis
of conformity be innovators?

Brzezinski closed by noting,
”The problem facing the So-
viet leaders is establishing the
relevance of the party to a
more commercialized, institu«
tionalized, advanCed, industrial-
ized society."

 

) Power
(Continued from Page 5)

Brzezinski, began to emerge in-
creasingly as a dominant figure.
Backed initially by the Right
against the Left. he subsequently
haVing destroyed the Left, turned
against the Right.

Khrushchev followed this same
tactic, Brzezinski noted, although
the period of true collective lead-
ership between 1953 and 1955 was
one in which violence was sys—
tematically rooted out from Soviet
politics by the use of violence. “Af-
terward, terror ceased to play an
important role in Soviet politics,"
Brzezinski said.

Commenting on the differences
between Stalin's era and the more
recent past, Brzezinski outlined
several important changes, ”The
range or disagreements between
the top leadership has become
much, much narrower," he said.
“The period of the heroic choices
between dramatic alternatives per-
haps is over." He noted that the
quality oi Soviet leadership has
declined, and that political victims.
no longer dismissed in such a ii-
nal sense as during Stalin’s purges,
sometimes recover former offices.

Brzezinski speculated on certain
alternative means for Soviet cul-
leciive leadership — “which is a
pleasant euphemism ior divided
power" — to solve the problem of
Succession.

“Precisely because the Soviet
Union cannot develop orderly tech-
niques for the translerral of rule.

Franiz Leads Grinnell Io Overtime
Victory in Non-Conference Match

The Grinnell basketball team
avenged an earlier defeat to Aur
gustana College by a score of SE
so in a Saturday night one over.
time contest.

Jeff Frantz swished a twenty foot
Jump shot with five seconds left in
the game to give Grinnell the win.
Frantz took scoring honors for
Grinnell with 31 points but had to
yield game scoring honors to hot
handed George Strombum of Au-
gustana. Strombom netted 13 of 16
shots from the floor and 3 of 9 free
throws in leading his team with 34
points.

The first half was a nip and tuck
affair as the score was tied ten
times. In the last two minutes
Augustana spurted to take a five
point lead.

For the first seven minutes of the
second half the teams traded baSv
ketsr The only break was a techni-
cal foul called on the Augustana
coach.

With twelve minutes remaining
Augustana held its biggest lead of
eight points. Then two baskets by
Frantz and one each by Tom Hill
and Ted Risser tied the score.

Later, with 33 seconds left, Hill
stole the ball and fed Clyde Smith
who put Grinnell ahead 79-78. Af-
ter Augustana threw the ball away,
Grinnell missed two free throws
but Smith got the rebound and was
fouled. His free throw gave Grin-

nell a two point lead with 19 sec-
nnds remaining,

Then Augustana brought the ball
down and Bob Karlblom tipped in
a shot. That sent the game into
overtime.

Two baskets by Hill and one by
Smith matched Auguslana’s six
points in overtime. Then came
Frantz’s shot that won the game.

Augustana brought to Grinnell a
towering team that included eight
players 6'4" or better, Their start-
ing lineup included a 6'6" freshman
center, Bob Karlhlom a 6'5" for-
ward who scored 24 points, and
6’3” George Strombom.

Grinnell employed a 1.371 zone to
lessen its height disadvantage. This
forced the inexperienced Augus-
tana guards into many mistakes.
Though Augustana shot a hot 57%
from the floor, they got off 22
fewer shots than Grinnell so the‘
Pioneers were able to match the
Vikings’ 34 field goals. Especially
effective on defense were Clyde
Smith and Tom Hill who either set
up or got several key steals

Augustana used its height ad-
vantage to take command of the re-
bounds. in the first half Augustana
led in rebounds 21o Augustana
took complete control on defense
by allowing Grinnell only four of<

great job in the second half though
by outrebounding their opponents

Thursday, Strubler temporarily
knocked out his opponent and
segool after drawing blood from
the Varsity grappler succumbed
to Strubler.

Although the fresh lost, they
certainly were not beaten.
Commendation certainly must
be given to Kelley of the fresh
for his efforts against Miller,
chosen last year as the varsity's
most valuable wrestler. Augus-
tine of the fresh also showed
remarkable efforts for a novice
wrestler in his first match. The
outlook for the fresh is certain»
ly favorable, Kin yo n and
Sharpe showed great potential
in their matches not to mention
Richman’s efforts.

dropped it to 2:26.8 against the
Scots, also claiming the pool stand-
ard in the process.

the race. But two losses would real-
ly drop us to the bottom.

“But, it will be a tough trip,”
Pfitsch added, pointing out that
this has been a big season for
home clubs. Visitors have man-
aged to win only nine of the first
89 loop aiiairs.

With most of the kinks
worked out following a month
and a half break, Grinnell's
matmen will open a heavy
February schedule by facing

double dual at Indianola to-
morrow.

“We seem to be in good
health and fairly good condi-
tion,” observed Coach Edd
Bowers. The team warmed up
for the double dual by taking
the freshmen in a practice meet
last Saturday.

The probable Grinnell line-
up will have Bill Barnes at 123;

Gomez Reminisces
Al Honor 6 Dinner

By A] Gummerson

Lefty Gomez, whose fast ball
may now lack a little zip but
whose wit is still sharp, played
the George Jessel bit at. the
Honor G banquet January 27.
Introduced by Tom Bucliholtz
as the “depression era of Bo
Belinsky," Lefty spent half an
hour explaining how not to do
it in the big leagues. At the end
many were wondering how one
guy could do so many things
wrong and still spend 13 years
with the Yankees; his modesty
came as quite a surprise to
those who associate “former
major league pitcher" with
Dizzy Dean,

About all Lefty would take
credit for was getting other
guys into the Hall of Fame.
Like Jimmy Foxx, who hit over
600 home runs; Lefty takes
credit for serving up 49 of
them, Or Joe DiMaggio; Lefty
claims that if he hadn't been
pitching, no one would have
known that Joe could run back
on a ball. Joe was a member
of that “fast, friendly outfield"
which, along with clean livin’,
Lefty claims were the secrets
of his success. Lefty, like Mari-
lyn Monroe, is a former room-
mate of the Yankee Clipper.

Like 01’ D12, though, Lefty's
favorite topic of conversation
is his hitting, not his pitching.
He can recall getting only two
doubles in his entire career,
And one of those times he took
a foot lead off second and got
picked on. Well, knowing that
there was a sure tine waiting for
him if he went back to the
bench, he tried hanging around
second, promising the umpire
that he ”wouldn’t get in the
way." It didn't work, he went
back, he got fined, Then there
was the time that he was bat-
ting against a pitcher who threw
a blooper ball, a pitch Lefty

from these four plus the return
to health of Ringo and the de—
velopment of sophomores Dowl—
ing, Deatherage, and Geller
during the remainder of the
schedule, Ringo split a pair of
early season matches though
slowed by multiple injuries.
Deatherage and Geller each
has one decision to his credit.

 

-:- Animal Life .

By Nick Nonas and Jim Ramsey

It is with hesitation that any
sports writer attempts a pro-season

basketball prediction, and we too
have our misgivings about the outa
come of the 1965 IM action. The
diificulty lies in finding a suitable
criterion on which to judge the
worth of a team. Certain writers
will maintain that 3 teams shooting
eiiiciency is somewhat commena
surate to how abundantly endowed
its players are with chest hair, but
this is somewhat 3 Gross Point.
Others are of the persuasion that
there exists a positive correlation
between innate athletic ability and
high board scores. But the authen-
ticity or such determinants as veri-
ﬁable criterion is still dubious.
Thus, until this year, sports writ-
ers and general athletic supporters
alike were iorced to rely on their
crystal balls and any number of
educated guesses. But at last, some
thoughtful and astute sage has pro«
vided us with what would appear

to be a ioniproot scheme ior ac-
curate predictions: the number or

games a basketball team wins will
hear an inversely proportional re-
lationshlp to the number or instate
players on that team.

Since we are left in the dark as
to why this phenomena exists, we
must hypothesize on our own, Let
us assume from the outset that the
activation syndrome of in-state
basketball players is more sensitive
to the decibal level of home crowd
enthusiasm and noise, due to cer-
tain emotional ties (God, mother,
State, etc). A physical maniiesta.
tion of this syndrome is profuse
perspiration, hampering a cager's
over-all play. Have you ever tried
to shoot and dribble with sweaty
palms. On the basis of this logical
exposition and on a careiul statisti-
cal evaluation ot the geographical
distribution of the in players in
each hall, it is our prediction that
Loose Hall will walk away' with
the Basketball crown.

 

describes as looking like a
rainbow, like you were pitching
over a shed, When the hall
came down over the plate Lefty
grabbed it, threw it up and hit
it fungo~style. The ump, lacking
a sense of humor, tossed him
out of the game and fined him
$100. Another time in Cleveland
it was dark and raining and
the Indians were ahead, but
they were trying to finish off
the top of the fifth inning be-
fore calling the game so Cleve-
land would win. Lefty walked
up to the plate and lit a match,
explaining to the umpire that
he just wanted to make sure
the pitcher knew where he was.
Again he got a trip to the show-
ers which cost him a hundred.

 

We think of the fifties and six-
ties as the Era of the Big Bon-
us, but Lefty must have had a
nest-egg stashed away from
somewhere to fall back on
every time an antic "cost him
a hundred.”

All in all, it was the start
of a good evening, sitting
around with your Honor G
iriends, lighting each others
cigarettes, listening to Lefty
reminisce. But I guess for the
Honor G boys the evening was
only beginni since I heard
talk of “festi ties" which were
to commence at nine o’clock.
Probably some sort of a party
celebrating the entrance of sev-
eral new members into the
club.

 

Karate Lessons to Begin Soon

Karate lessons for beginning students will begin next Friday.
Instructor Jim Young urges anyone who is seeking a good con-
ditioner that is also a practical carry-aver sport to place a card
bearing his name and post office box number in box 1256 by
next Thursday morning. The size of the Class will be limited, so
acceptance will be in order of receipt of replies.

A feature article about the karate club will appear in next

week’s 5&3.
