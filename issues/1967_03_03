New AWS Pres. Stresses
Initiative. Communication Representative

By Mary Malcolm

Leida Schoggen, newly elected president or the AWS board, is
anything but a veteran of campus politics. A transfer irorn Park
College. St. Louis, in 1965, and a participant in the Washington
semester last tall, Leida possesses an unusual enthusiasm and
optimism about Grinnell Virtually undiminished by the two se-
mesters she has spent on campus.

While uninitiated in Grinnell
campus politics, Miss Schog~
gen's experiences as a political
science major, a student or
Headstart last semester in
Washington, a worker with pre-
school oulturaiiy deprived stu<
dents last summer and iemale
delinquents the previous sum-
mer, indicates her ability to
deal with people and their prob«
lems.

As AWS board president,
Miss Schoggen is concerned with
“process.” She indicated the
most important concern lor next
year's student leaders will be
to continue and expand the pro-
cess of communication and stu-
dent initiative begun by the
Kent administration.

With reterence to working out
a satisfactory hall residents
system on South Campus she
said, “It’s going to work, be-
cause we're going to make it
Work,"

Miss Schoggen’s enthusiasm
for Grinnell derives partly
from comparison with Ameri-
can University, location or the
Washington semester. She
found that Grinnell in general
takes itseli less seriously, is
more relaxed and more recep
tlve to dliterent ways or feeling,
thinking and behaving. “When
I came back here I could re—
lax, and it wasn't that I didn’t
love Washington and the pro—
gram," she said. “At Grinliell
you feel tree to express how
you think and teel about things."

‘Delia Ministry'
Comes This Week

By Lllah Morton

A representative irom the
Delta Ministry, o church-spon-
sored civil rights organization,
will be on campus Wednesday,
March 8.

November Elections Drive

Miss Sue Geiger describes
her organization as “basically
interested in community and
economic development ior Ne
groes in Mississippi and work
with people in local communi-
ties towards these ends. This,
of course, encompasses all areas
at lite, including politics, which
this year are extremely im-
portant. Our priority for l.%‘1
is the local elections which
will be held in November. This
will be the first test of the
Negro vote since they have been
registered in any number.”

Economics and Education

The Delta Ministry has func-
tioned in Mississippi since the
Ialioi1964. it is concerned with

economic development, encour-
agement of public responsibility,
and education among the dis-
possessed. Also essential to the
success of the Delta Ministry
is the work with the white and
the middle-class Negro com-
munities. Mount Beulah is the
Ministry's headquarters, and
twice has been used to house
groups of homeless people on
cotton plantations

The Board of Religion is
sponsoring Miss Geiger’s visit
in the hope that Grinnell stu-
dents might be interested in
working on the project during
spring Vacation or helping the
Ministry indirectly. The coffee
hour will be at 4 p.m. in the
South Lounge.

Senate Saves SGA Convention

By Richard Schnelrov

Wednesday night the Senate
deteated by a vote or 28-23 Mary
Malcolm’s proposal (printed in
last week's Std!) to abolish the
SGA Convention. Miss Malcolm
objected to “high pressure pol<
ltics." Opponents at her pro-
posal pointed to student enthu-
siasm and involvement gener-
ated by the Convention.

The Senate approved a motion
submitted by Najwe Adra to
hold a last after spring vacation
{or the purpose of raising money
to bring Sudanese students to
the United States. The Execu-
tive Cabinet Will talk with the
administration a b o ut having
more than one fast a semester.
At present there can be only
one fast.

The Senate also passed I
change in the by-laws that

unds Sex Education Committee

would extend the term of the
Student Auditor to coincide witli
the completion of other SGA‘
nilices. To go into efiect th
change will have to be approve
again at the next Senate meeti-
ing.

CoiHP President Bob Foot!
announced that the CofHP had
been discussing with Director
or Residences Ralph Pomerenld
the possibility of bringing more
vending machines onto North
Campus. The machines would
be installed in the kitchenette!
ln Cowles. Younkers, and Lan-
gan. A survey will be distri-
buted shortly to determine whal
products students desire.

The Senate approved the al-
location of $105 to the Sex Ed-
ucation Committee, The admin:
istration will supply another
3105 to defray the total cost.

College Seeks NSF Grant

By Pat Smith

Grinnell has applied to
the College Science improve-
ment Program at the National
Science Foundation for a $193,000
grant ior expansion within the
natural and social science da-
partmenis.

The application speciﬁes that
the grant would establish a
researchestudy fund, a sat»
batical assistance fund, a fac-
ulty seminar program and tield
studies in anthropology and bi-
ology.

Stated objectives for expan-
sion within the biology, Chemis-
try, physics, mathematics, an-
thropology, economics, political
science, and sociology depart<
merits include: (1) “improved
conditions of scholarship con.
ducive to attraction and main<
tenance of a faculty of high
nroiessional quality." (2) “up
ﬂooding of faculty confidence in
subject matter areas,” (3) “up-
grading ot student seientiiic
confidence and encouragement
oi related pedagogical experi-
mentation in science education,"
and (4) ”expanded opportun~
ities for field studies in bio-
logical and social sciences."

The live speciﬁc allocations
ot the grant are designed to
luliiil the objectives. The re-

search-study fund would enable
faculty members to participate
in summer study projects and
summer research projects.

The sabbatical assistance fund
would increase the salary of a
biology, chemistry, or physicl
protessor trom one semester's
pay to a full year's pay full
the year he takes his leave.
(Currently, a professor is given
a semester's salary for an ab-
sence of either a semester or
a year.)

The faculty seminar program
would establish regular semi~
nars ior protessional studies.
and as this would necessitate
a lighter teaching load, the iund
would permit the hiring or extra
professors. A field program tor

Grant Received

Grinnell has received the
$537,100 grant irom the ted-
eral government which it re

Curriculum Suggestion —

Since its beginning, the Negro’s struggle for civil
and human rights has stressed his privileges as an
American citizen as well as his rights as a human being.
For, the Negro in the United States is not only part of
a distinct racial progress, but also part of the total de-
velopment of American society. The Negro’s role in
American history has, however, been almost completely
ignored in conventional classwork. Although certain Grin-
nell courses mention some facts of Negro history in an
incidental manner, no direct and detailed formal investi-
gation of the subject is offered.

Negro history is usually excluded from course offer-
ings because it is supposedly too specialized an area of
study for a small liberal arts college, Certainly Grinnell
should emphasize broad, integrated, rather than narrow,
restricted course work. But the inclusion of Negro history
as merely an addition to already existing courses would

robably not give it the importance and stress that Negro
llistory deserves. Until Negro history is given its proper
emphasis in American history from grade school on,
a separate, comprehensive course is necessary to compens
sate for the neglect. Two areas that could merit special
attention are the Reconstruction period and the civil
rights efforts of recent years,

At Grinnell there may be difficulty in finding some-
one who feels qualified to teach the subject. The college
could, however, seek outside resources. Response to last
semester’s questionnaire about the LeMoyne program

dicated interest in a faculty exchange program. Since

egro history is an area in which LeMoyne, which al-
ready offers the course, could contribute to Grinnell, isn’t
this a natural opportunity for initiating the suggested ex-
change? Any arrangement of this kind would require pa
tient effort and persistent enthusiasm, but the benefits
for both colleges would be great.

At a time when much of American life is dominated
by the battle for racial equality and dignity, Grinnell can-
not continue to ignore the importance of acquainting its
white students with a knowledge of their fellow Ameri-
cans and its Negro students with a sense of their own his-
torical identity. “Black and white together” has meaning
only if we know who the “black" is and what he has ac-
complished for and with the “white." P

Apartments for Women —

Women students were presented with a pleasant sur-
prise yesterday. Dean Alice Low notified junior women
that the college tentatively plans to allow a limited num-
ber of them to live off-campus in private apartments in
their senior year, 1967-68. This new freedom, coupled
with the recent proposal to abolish women’s nightime
hours restrictions, recognizes for the first time women
students’ rights to equal social responsibilities.

Mrs. Low does seem to consider the new possibility
in women’s housing a temporary one, however. Mrs. Low
and a committee are studying the question of building a
new women’s dorm that may potentially bring students
back on-campus. But hopefully this committee will give
considerable weight to the opinions expressed by a signifi-
cant segment of the student body in the 5&1! article last
week “Students Endorse Apartments".

Students have a wide variety of dwelling needs.
Possibilities for different types of living ﬂ dorms and
apartments, co-op and coed dorms — should exist side
by side.

A Student Opinion

ill Defense of Selective Servio

By Steve Shender

in spite of the fact that current fashion among
Certain senators from Massachusetts and libel"
allyroriented college students dictates the con«
demnalion ol the present Selective Service Sys~
tern, much remains to be said in its defense.
While Senator Kennedy‘s plan for a national lot-
tery and the NSA position on the dralt are to be
commended for their noble egalitarian semis
ments, it should be recognized that they ignore
a hard reality bl mid-20m century society, and
thus obscure the real issues at stake.

To employ a hackneyed cliche. our present
era is one of increasing complexity on all fronts.
In foreign affairs, national security planning, edu~
cation, and urban planning — in name only a few
ﬁelds m the demand of American society for
highly educated, technically competent individu-
als is steadily increasing. There are few people
who would deny that without such individuals
our potential culture functioning in a predomis

’nanlly primitive, agrarian world would be se-

riously impaired. in short, the objective Candis
tions of the present epoch require, more than
ever, the existence of an intellectual-technical
elite corps for national survival.

The present Selective Service System was de-
signed in full cognizance ni this hard fact oi life.
It was created and instituted to ensure the con-
servation of a valuable natural resource — in-
tellectual competence and technical Skill _. ll an
era of limited warfare. The major crit ism of
current detractors of the system is that it is un-
fairly biased against certain ethnic communities
and lower-income groups in general, Their an-
swer to the problem lies in the substitution of
some sort of arbitrary system of conscription for
the present system. By being arbitrary, the new
draft system would necessarily be more just. Yet
an inherent problem Di a "just", arbitrary sys—

tem lies in tile fact that it is also blind, and it
blindness may be inimical to our real national
interests. For who can really measure the long.
run societal costs of a search for blind justice

‘which results in the siphoning off or some of our

most important intellectual resources to the
battlefields of Vietnam, or Thailand, or Cam-
bodia, or wherever our current mania for “pre-
venlive warfare" threatens to take us. As long as
we can afford it (that is, as long as we can avoid
involvement in an armed conflict on the scale of
World War H) We must make some attempt to
be selective. It is far better to rationalize unfair-
ness in a manner which minimizes the long-run
costs to society, in terms of intellectual resources,
than to cast our fate to the winds of a national
lottery at universal military service.

All of this is not 10 deny that certain gmup.
in our society are bearing an unjustly dispropor-
tionafe share of the military burden. Yet the in-
justice comes not from the present Selective Serv-
icce System, but from the fact that our society
penalizes certain individuals for circumstances
of birth and environment which are beyond their
control. The criteria for the present system of se«
lection is intellectual capacity as gauged by at-
tendance at an institution All higher education. It
thus reflects the injustice of society because it
has a builtrin bias against individuals who, be-
cause of racial origins, early educational depriva-
tions, and economic hardship — rather than be-
cause of the lack of intellectual capacity — have
been unable to gain admittance to one of the
country’s several thousand ivory towers. While
making out draft law more arbitrary will serve
to prevent it from mirroring the real injustice of
society, it will not serve to rectify that injustice.
Indeed, by providing an added drain on our in-
tellectual resources, it will only serve to make 1!
more difficult for us lo solve the underlying prob-
lems which make the present Selective Service
System so unpalatable.

The True Grinnell
To the Editor:

The recent election has clear
ly shown the true spirit of the
liberal Grinnell student body.
When faced with a choice be-
tween action or being pacified,
between progress or promise,
the majority chose, in the true
spirit ol rural America, to be
content with what they have
and to be fooled by a facade of
“profitable” discussions with
the admlnistration,

The majority ni Grinnell is,
has been, and probably always
will be fooled. They were not
fooled by the candidates, not
by the administration, but lhey
are fooled by themselves. They
fool themselves into believing
that they are a new generation
full of new thoughts and are
willing to accept the ideas of
the previous generation. They
fool themselves into believing
that Grinnell promotes indivl»
duality and new thoughts.

In reality the majority of
Grinnell consists of small town
Victorian people and thoughts,
In reality Grinnell teaches that
conformity is the best way,
and we are incapable bl our
own worthwhile thought. There
is a lot of talk about progress,
just as there is a lot of talk
about sex, and I lot of talk
Xbuut drugs: there is just u lot
of talk. Grinnell is a stronghold
of conservative America, pro-
tected from any new ideas by
miles of cornfields.

I do not say that this is
wrong. I only say that those
people who are fooling them-
selves should recognize that.
Grinnell is basically conserva-
tive, and they should realize
that they will end up living a
nice middle class life, agreeing
in several years with such fam-
ous seventeenth cenluiy philo—
sophers as Glenn Legzelt and
John Crosett. Recognize thlt
you are quite willing to be con-

and realize that such events as
spring riot are only a reward
by Papa Legget fnr being nice
little boys and girls all year.
Once you realize this, perhaps
you will also realize why the
majority of those students not
willing to be moulded by Grin»
nell’s compulsive conformity
either transfer 01‘ are removed
by the administration,

No Privacy

To the Editor:

Anyone who spends much
time in South Lounge has prob»
ably experienced the nuisance
of being told to sit up straight.
Two weeks ago, when ibis hap»
pened to me, I asked on in
explanation of the reasoning
behind the rules. I was entire
ly ignored. In fact, the person
walked away while i was talk
ing. 1 then sent. the following
letter. As of yet, i have not
received a reply; therefore, i
subnlit the letter as an open
letter:

Mi . Jewell Hawk, Director
Grinnell College Forum
Dear Mrs. Hawk:

Since you did not have the
common courtesy to finish our
conversation before walking
away, i must use this letter to
voice my objections.

First, why is South Lounge
called a lounge? If we wanted
an extension of the library,
then cxiin couches could have
easily been placed in Bin-ling.
I fail to see the crime involved
if 1 choose to use South Lounge
to relax, yet i am plagued with
the continual nuisance of some-
one tapping on my shoulder,

Sccond, 1 asked you what you
proposed as an alternative to
South Lounge (If you recall
this is the point at which you
walked away while 1 was talk-
ing. Will you please answer
this question? When I complain
of the lack of privacy at Grin-
nell, 1 up told that "range-
ments other than open dorms

disruption of my privacy in
South Lounge illustrates the
fallacy of this ﬂgumentv So
again I ask, where am I to ﬁnd
Privacy?

Third, under what authority
do you continually disturb me?
My understanding is that the
Forum is the place designed
[or student social use, I want
to use it for that purpose, not
as a show place.

This time please answer my
questions.

Sincerely,
David D. Schrcck

iThis is the carbon from the
letter 1 sent to Mrs. Hawk two
weeks ago.)

Young’s Crazy People

To the Editor:

The dearth of “crazy people"
which Mr. Young nutEd in his
essay in last week’s son has
more to do with an apparently
revised admissions policy, I ha-
licve, then it does with the col-
lege itself. Quite frankly, there
hasn’t been a richly endowed
(with “crazy people") class ad,
mitted since the characters
who were seniors my freshman
year departed. True. this is sad,
but it isn’t the college enviro—
ment that is preventing crazi-
ness from ﬂourishing.

Mr. Young suggests that
Grinnell might to do more to
“accommodate, even encourage,
the exceptional" and he sug»
gests as a reason for our lack
of crazy people “that we make
it too difficult to be crazy
here.”

I don’t think that the Grin»
nell atmosphere, itself, can be
held responsible for the lack
of crazy people. No one is
forced to sucn‘iice his colorful
eccenuiciliss for a serious, pro-
ductive, highly-motivated way—
of-life. A true crazy person!
in the best sense of the word,
"crazy” - will proceed in his
own crazy style in spite of ihe

Gyherneiies Forces Values Rethinking l

By Hank Balikov

Man makes his destiny be
cause of and with the tools that
he makes. This was the theme
of Dr. Emmanuel Mesthene
during Cybernation Weekend,
Feb. 2425.

Dr. Mesthene, Executive Di-
rector oi the Harvard Univer-
sity Program on Technology
and Society, said man acts out
his role as maker in a variety
or ways; When he understands
nature; when he improves po—
litical relationships; or when he
appreciates art and knows God.
in technologically active times
(such as the present) institu-
tions cannot hold values or so»
cial mores. In technologically
less active times, activity is
centered on social preoccupa<
thin and readjustment. But a
common reaction to changes
brought by the cybernetic ago
is to hold tight to familiar
meanings or basic tenets. This
at present tends to introduce a
Schism between science and
values.

Man can now be an artist
with technology as his art. He
acts both by knowing and by
altering his environment. when
altering nature he is directly
using tools to make an object
for a purpose according to a
preconceived idea. This prior
conception and material reali-
zation are essential, and are
the basis of art. But it is also
usetul to distinguish between
art and science according to
their purposes. Art looks to the
thing in itselt, the object tor
Its own sake. Science uses the
object as intermediary, from
which the making gives knowl-
edge. In the past it has been
possible to keep these ideas in
separate categories; one would
be the distinction between basic
and applied science. But re-
search science is relatively new
and though it concerns the
basic relationship of artist on

material, the material (his
tool) by its power is forcing a
wedding of technology and Sci-
ence.

Science Affects Culture

Science has had great effects
on culture for the past few
Centuries but it was not under-
taken lor these side-eflects.
Technology too had its cultural
effects in the industrialization
that followed invention. Tech-
nology is now seen as a means
to further Valuable ends.

Once science is pursued for
its goals, it is drawn into the
area or social pupose. Our tools
are so sophisticated that they
have expanded science beyond
the lab so that parts of science
require the world as laboratory.
Science is ﬁnding out what
nature is like and is both chang-
ing to meet it and changing
nature. Because science has
grown so large it must be the
public who has the right to say
what changes can be made in
the world, Knowing nature and
altering nature have become a
single process.

We have learned too much to
aspire to the complicated sys<
temic philosophy oi the 19th
century but we must realize
that the opposite is just as bad.
The tools we now use have
welded together in art the
transformative and the cogni-
tive, New tools require social
reorganization if their potential
is to be realized, Philosophy of

the new technology cannot lag
too far behind else we find our<
selves incapable or making the
changes necessary for our sur-
vival.

The cybernetic age has also
brought a new distinction be
tween the public and the pri-
vate. In just one instance a
large amount oi research, nee
essary icr our progress (and
existence) is now financed by
the government and directed by
government policy.

Increased Government Role

There is an increased de-
mand for those public goods
served by the government. Pri-
vate enterprise has fallen into
on institutional lag (vacuum)
but ls invading some neglected
areas or need. American Gyp.
sum works in urban redevelop-
ment and General Electric in
building new cities.

Our new purposes are an
expression or our new values.
Nothing is seen as impossible.
There is a new commitment to
rationality as a means of social
control. Planning is no longer
seen as bad for a tree society

pushing toward reality. A lo-
cation has been found In an
empty building next to Leeper's
Music store on Broad street.
As the first step toward turn~
ing this space into a coffee
house, a work party will be
held there tomorrow lrorn 1:30

Resioraiion Singers “Catch 0n" é

By JEFF DUNN

As those who attended the
Forum Catawba Dltliyramb last
semester Will know, the “Catch
Club” is ﬂat Major Albert
Omer’s division of the Faculty
Softball Team, but rather a
gang oi “profs" that spends
most or its time “wining and
wenching" ~ musically, that
ls—with Malcolm Nelson (Eng-
ﬁsh)

The Dithyramh ieatured ihe
ﬁrst Griunell periorniance or
that group —— more formally
known as Restoration Catch
singers — who are devoted to
the rendition oi those peculiar
sort of seventeenth century
rounds as “Catches”.

Since that highly successful
display oi musicianship, the
Cathers in roadtrip recitals have
caught on among students oi
Luthers and Graceland colleges.
And now, world weary, they
have iortumately consented to

sing again in the Forum to‘
night.

The club members are strict-
ly music history hurts. Mr. Nel-
son, who organized the singers
from the faculty, has made
extensive researches via Uni-

versity Microfilms in order to
locate unexpurgated editions,0i
catches for the hobby which
has fascinated him since 1952i
He describes the “catch” as
“a sophisticated canon in three
or four parts usually dealing
with women and wine. It is un-
accompanied polyphony tor
male Voices; and the text oiten
contains puns or obscenitles
which are emphasized, or even
created by the music.”

A catch diilers from a true
round or canon in that parts
are not necessarily duplicated
in all voices and tend to catch
up with one another toward the
end oi the composition, finishr
ing on a unison (hence the

name “catch”), The catches
had their most common usage
in men’s drinking clubs of the
Restoration and later (hence
the restricted range of topics;
(Are there any other?)

The major purpose of the Re‘
storation Catch Club ~— how-
ever professional its outrofeiown
bookings may seem — is to have
a good round of fun for all con-
cerned. Although parts can be
difficult and need close cor-
ordination (and straight iaces!),
Mr. Nelson does not wish to
be maestro to his singers.
Within certain limits, all sing-
ers are expected to sustain their
own individuality of line, It is
amazing how well this demo<
cratic approach fosters spon-
taneity oi periormance.

Other members of the group
include Givens Thornton (psy-
chology). George Eastman
(education), Robert Canary
(English) and Charles Sellers
(Assistant to the President)

Examining produce in an open—air marketplace in Lisbon is one way to broaden one’s knowl~

More On
The P.E. Complex

To the Editor:

Being a supporter oi the
new RE. complex I would like
to consider the questions of
whether the complex would
lead to an overempiiasis on

W

SUN.-MON.-TUES.

athletics at the expense oi oth~
er programs and ot whether
the m3. complex hinders nlhs
er necessary building pro
grams,

1 will deal with the cond
question iiist. The admi stra-
tion seems to teel that they
have a good chance at getting
the money tor the complex
iroin loans and grants which
would not hinder other build-
ing which President Leggett
announced in his iive and ten
year programs. Granted it this
money does not become avail.
able the money will have to
be raised elsewhere and other
programs may be hindered.
However, the PE. dcpa .
ments are a part ot the Gr
hell community and tor this
reason they should receive due
consideration tor their require.
ments, especially since they
have been waiting on the
priority list since 1951. One
good reason ior building the
complex now is that the funds
available now probably will
not be available in several
years so that building now may
be the best way not to inter-
iere with other programs and
still tuliill our needs in this
area.

The next part oi the ques-
tion is whether or not the
complex would lead to an liver-
emphasis oi “jacks" at the ex-
pense oi other segments oi the
college community. At the
present time it is very hard to
believe that this is the case
because with the present ath-
letic iacilities it is very hard
to attract the scholar-athlete
much less the so-cailcd "pure
jock" type. For the inturc one

ance oi the this taculty and

it may be interesting in this
light to make a comparison
with another school which has
iaced the same problem. Carle~
ton completed a new men’s
PE. complex in 1964. They
have also recently completed a
woman's P. complex contain-
ing some litles which are
superior to the ones we have
now tor all campus use. While
in Nortlitield recently I hap
pened to read the carletonian
and I found that their stu-
dents are generally concerned
about the same things as we
are as reported by the sits
with the exception that no one
there is worried about an over-
empliasis on athletics. I hope
that the 5&3 can contirm this
atter interviewing the Carle-
ton student leaders.

with these considerations in
mind it is very diiiicult ior me
to see that there is a problem
oi emphasis and degree with
regard to the new complex ex-
cept possibly in some peoples’

minds.

The Review of

“After the FaII”

To the Editor:

I am very sorry that. the 55d}

someone from outsids to red
View After the Fall: I think
that a mistake was made in do-
ing So. and I also think that
this mistake led to some even
more regretahle results.

I do not pretend to be a pro-
iessional reviewer oi plays nor
a reviewer oi plays at all, but
rather a mere member oi the
audience With some experience
in theater and also with very
close to the same obser ‘onal
and emotional sensihil ics as
any other person, including
Nicholas Meyer.

The iirst mistake was in
thinking that going outside oi
the community to engage an
unbiased observer would con-
sequently produce unbiased re.
sults. In one sense this is true:
the bias ot iamiliarity with the
cast is avoided. On the other
hand, it is possible to engage
an observer who is too preoc.
cupicd with the dramatically
and technically protessional
theater to be aware oi the col-
lege and nonrprofessioml con
text oi such a production, It
seems to me that anyone at
this college would admit that
we are not a protessional thea-
tcr nor are we trying to be
one. It Nicholas Meyer were
going to pit our production
against the Lincoln Repertory
and Elia Kazan, then perhlpl
he has grounds ior his review;
but I don't think he can use a
prnfessional production or pro.
iessional methods as a stand-

ard ior comparison; and I say
this simply because I don't
think we are or can try to be
protessional with the resources
we have,

It is also very good to be ta
iniiiar with Arthur Miller's
lite and the relevance oi the
play to his lite. But for the
sake oi reviewing. let’s stick
to the staging and the script,
not to its cause; the script is a
common denominator ior any
production and the stage and
the context oi the stage are
the variables.

Again. I suppose that trom a
professional point oi view, the
iirst night’s production oi a
play is likely to be a pretty
good standard ior judging sub-
sequent performances, But
again. too, this is not a profes-
sional theater. Perhaps the re
viewer should have remained
one or two more nights bciorc
making his judgments and
then he might have been justi-
fied in saying what he did it
what he said were still the
case.

It is indeed untortunate that
two at the tour night's audi-
ences, myseli included, were
given the review to read be
tore they saw the play, I
couldn't help but go into the
production with a negative at.
titndc, Fortunately, and I
hope it is the same case ior
the rest oi the audiences. i
overcame this ieeling in the
iirst hour and twenty minutes
oi the play, and I do not re-
call “scratching behind the
ears." And as iar as no con-
cerned (and that's all this is
about), when I come out ot a
play hating one character, lov-
ing another, weeping ior an.
other, and empathizing with
another, I know that that play
is protoundly entertaining, and
ior this college, to be highly
prized.

On Neil Fischer
To the Editor:

1 don’t imagine anybody will
pay any attention to this letter
because I am a triend oi
SAGA Chuck's as well as a
SAGA worker. As iar as I know
Neil Fischer has never once
eonverscd with Chuck about
complaints or constructive sug-
gestions which he might have.
He resorts to letters and hurts
his “campaign" to improve our
iood. How can he expect chang-
es when he antagonizes the peo-
ple he should be talking with
on a halfwayrhiiman basis?

Why doesn't Neil organize
a committee to meet on iriend.
ly terms with SAGA to tails
about the quality or our iood?
Learn about the limitations oi
our kitchens, the problems ot
cooking tor silo guys, and the
results oi the SAGA surveys on
campus, Make some decent sug-
gestions. consider the money
you spend ior meals ior over
200 days. the tact that the re-
cent Board increase was the
iirst in about '1 years, and rise
ing iood prices.

It Neil really wants to see
some progress and not merely
shoot oii his month, then I
hope he will iollow this sug-
gestion. Ii he doesn’t really
want to see anything done we
should ask SAGA to let tiio
College run the kitchens tor
one month. Then we would real.
ly experience had institutional
iood.

I'm sick of seeing Chuck

bashed around like some dog.
Treat him iairly or shut up, I
seriously doubt that Neil
speaks ior any maiority, It he
does, I think we've got a prob
lent—and it's not Saga.

More on Fischer
To the Editor:

In response to Neil Fisch-
er’s comments on Grinnell
iood i i .

Mr. Fischer, I too am ted up.
I am more than a little tired of
reading letters to the editor
that substitute poor taste and
oilensivc language ior wit and
satire. I am also tired ot being
told that, as a member oi a
group that is reasonably satis-
tied with many aspects oi
Grinnell lite, including the
iood. I am some kind oi mind<
less belcher oi “acrimonious
platitude l' indoctrinatcd by
the admi istration and lacking
in any kind ot discrimination.
But I am especially tired or
listening to people complain
because Grinnell iood inst
daesn’t measure up to their ul-
trahigh, gourmet standards.

Atter iour years at Grinnell I
am convinced that our iood
service, as I have seen it in op.
eration at the Quad, is gen-
uinely concerned with giving
us the best possible service,
SAGA wants to know what we
want and like and sincerely
tries to please us. or course
our iood isn't periect, and
there is room ior improve-
ment here, just as there is
room for improvement in
many aspects oi liie at Grille
hell. But SAGA is so much bet-
ter than so many school cater.
ing services (and I am familiar
with several) that there is al-
most no comparison, and I am
ied up with people who com-
plain because they can't have
pertection,

Have you ever considered
being appreciative oi the
things you do have? Or are the
rights and privileges oi at-
finance and intellect too great
to allow this? Ii you can iind
time train your literary ac~
tivity, think about this tor a
moment.

In the meantime. it you can
find a college that will serve
you pheasant under glass and
champagne, or homecooking
just like mother’s I suggest
that you transicr as soon as

possible”

the college. Grinnell students
have recognized the need roi-
these facilities tor some time
and they have been persistent
in expressing a desire for them.

I hope the students will be
just as persistent in expressing
their desire for retorms in the
present sﬂclal system at Grin-
nell. Judging from recent ac-
Lion hy the administration and
lack of action by the faculty, 1
think a great deal at student
pers' tence may he called tor
if G innell is to maintain its
tradition of sensitivity to the
needs of the student in a
rapidly changing society.

Mr, Leggett tells me that
the students at Grinnell Ire
too impatient. Although I have
forsaken the warmth and shel-
ter of Grinnell and now inhabit
the cold, cruel world, I still
find myself sympathizing with
the students’ impatience. From
my vantage point in the out-
side world, I find that the liv-
ing conditions at Grinnell
seem more inhuman than ever.

Perhaps Mr. Leggett would
he a little more impatient if
he were forced to live the life
of a Grinnell student for a few
days or weeks. Living in a
dorm, eating in a dining hall,
and making love in public
Flaces are somehow not quite
as satisfying as living in a
home, eating with one’s inti-
mate friends, and making love
in private.

It living conditions at Grin-
neli were a bit more conducive
to the healthy development of
the individual into it self-gov-
erning and responsible human
being, perhaps there would be
no need for expanded mental
health facilities.

to be good to each other and
to love each other without a
war like this. All says if. is
lor freedom they are fight-
ing, but my opinion is, that
the only freedom, which is
right treedoiii, is that trice-
dom that is won through a
conversion or the mind of
man and not through killing
another. The greatest com-
mand, that is given by the
Lord Jesus Cln-ist, and this
is: “Love your neighbor as
yourseu" and that the fishy
ing men do not practice this
commend, I think, out or
course, it is difficult to stop
suddenly, but l think, it will
do the world hotter, when
the war stop . . . __ _____

Are you
discontented

towork for
G.E.?

Does water pollution bug you? Or smog? Does 1!
concern you that some places in the country never
have enough teachers? Or nurses? And when you
read about the growing pains of a developing na~
ticn. do you wish you could do something?

You can. Thousands of General Electric people
are helping‘to solve the problems of a growing,

changing world.

Generating more (and cheaper) electricity with
nuclear reactors. Controlling smog in our cities
and pollution in our streams. Using electronics to
bring the teaching skills of an expen into many
classrooms at once, the trained eyes of a nurse
into many hospital rooms at once

it you’re not content with the world as It is . . .
and if you have the brains, imagination and drive
to help build a better one, we‘d like to talk to you.

See the man 1rol1l G.E. during hls next campus
visit. Come to General Electric. where the young

men are important men.

and it does not have to mean
collectivization. Although our
social artistry is much less de
veloped than our command oi
physical nature, our growing use
at tools might make social art-

ists of us.

The aiiluent societies created
by the cybernetic age may be
characterized by the surplus 01
money and resources that are
available ior social goals. There
is a rise in both skill and re-
training requirements. Educa-

Religion Needs Explaining

Religion and the divine must
now be explained, not explained
away. Mesthene says religious
experience is too persistent a
fact of history and human na-
ture to dismiss. While the con-
tent of truth changes as the
World does. the function does
not. Value changes, valuing does
not. Religion satisﬁes man’s
ability to see, act and unity.
it is a common vision oi what
man could be if he were so
human that he would be no
longer physical. God is maker
and ultimate purpose. Man is
pure artist. God is what man
has made him with his tools
and because of man’s use oi
these tools, it is his best work.

In a subsequent interview
With the 5&3, Dr, Mesthene
commented on those jobholders
that will be displaced by the
increasing demand ior skills.

The LM. basketball season is
iinally dragging to a close and
a new champion has been
crowned. Dibble swept through
the last half or the season to
finish with a 19-1 record. The
Dibble “A" team was the only
quintet in either league to flu-
ish undefeated. Gates “B" lin-
ally broke their loss string at
thirty~nine games by beating
Cowles “B”, 37-32. The game
was witnessed by a crowd
nearly equal to those at the

He said it is up to the younger
generations to realize that jobs
have always changed as so«
cieties progressed, and to edu<
Cate themselves for these
changes, not blindly follow the
paths ot their tathers. Many
of the new opportunities for em-
ployment will he available in
the service occupations depend
ing on the society's degree of
aiiluence. Grinneli should pre-
pare its students for the cyber-
netic age by emphasizing the
values of our society in our
courses,

Dr. Mesthene expressed his
faith in man’s ability to use
his increasing technological
prowess to maintain his exist-
ence and advance his abilities
