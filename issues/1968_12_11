25 of l35 Majors
Attend Science
Division Meeting

A meeting or majors in the
Science division was held on
Monday, rollowing a memoran-
dum from Dean stauss concern
ing the possibility of seating
junior and senior majors on
their divisions' Educational
Policy Committees. The pro-
posal was designed to make
possible taculty consultation
with students on departmental
reaching policies.

of the 135 majors in the
Science division, only 25 ats
tended this ﬁrst meeting tor
discussion of the proposal. Stu~
dents who did come brought up
several questions concerning
the mechanics or seating stu<
dent EPC members,

Mr. Walker, chairman of the
Science division, commented
that there was no consensus
at the meeting on the options
offered, He added, “I don‘t con-
sider oileefiftlt oi the group or
majors suggested in the Exec-
utive Council's plan to he rep—
resentativa of the division.”

Walker continued, “I, per-
sonally, am seriously interest

ed in getting some feedback

from students, because 1 think
it is extremely important that
a student voice be heard in
curricular affairs}

Yearly Woes Plague
Wrestlers Again

A perennial Grinnell wres-
tling prohlem, lack of depth
and balance, confronts Con-
ney ximbro as he begins his
inaugural season as Pioneer
mentor.

Coach Kimbm's five re-
turning lettermen include a
trio of planets at last year's
Midwest Conference Meet.

Dori Kraitsik, the loop's
1677pdund titlist in 1967,
placed third in that weight
class last winter atter being
sidelined most of the cams
paign by an arm injury. He
returned to action just a
week before the loop meet,
and posted a 6-3 record for
the season.

Bill Wedding capped a
15-4-1 campaign by taking
second at 160, and Joel Rickr
man came in fourth at 123
and compiled an 8-6 mark lor
the Season.

The other Veterans are Bob
LeBell, who was 2716 at 145
and 152, and John Shaw,
1-151 at 130, 145 and 152.

The top sophomore pros-
pects are Ted click, 160-167;
Steve Hutchings, 167: and
Alex Karlin, a 191 pounder
who will have to fill in at
heavyweight much at the
time, They were consistent
winners a year ago as mem-
bers of Grimiell's freshman
team,

 

The Trains Hardly Go By Anymore

Every Monday and Thursday
aitcrnoon a slow ireiglit departs
f1 .ni Llutshalltown, 1a., bound
tor Albia. it is the only rogue
larly scheduled train which still
uses the iron horsepath which
graces central campus. Occa-
sionally, a handcar can be seen.
but the Grinnell College of yes-
tet'yeai' which attracted train-
loving students irom all over
the country is dead. In the
near future, esideace halls niuy
even he using railroad ties to
stoke their fireplaces.

The railroad has had an im<
portant role in the history of
Grinnell. 1. B. Grinnell founded
the city oi Erimiell at the inter
section of the northrsnuth and
the eastrwest railroad lines,
After Horace Greeley told Grin-
iieil to “Go West, young man,"
he did, and in St, Louis he met
Henry Fart-lam, the man who
owned the railroad which built
the nortli~soutlt line through
campus. r'rom him, Griniolt
learned where his line would
cross the Rock Island, and
there he founded Gn'nnell,

When the town was founded,
.1. H. Grinnell laid out its gen-
eral plan. Among other things,
he set. aside the land for Gri .
nell University which he hoped
would be built someday, At that
time the north-south line ran
beside the campus rather than
through it, The College did not

purchase the land east of the
tracks until later. Students who
consider the tracks in central
campus a nuisance may wonder
why Grinnell set aside land
next to the railroad tracks for
a College. No large plot ot land
could have been very far from
rails, especially it it were near
the center oi the Grinnell of
the 1850’s.

in 1863, the ﬁrst passenger
train Came down from the
north. An entry in the diary of
Josephus Eastman for June 27,
186.5, described the event. “The
first passenger car came
through today. This is an era
in the history of Grinnell. It
looks like the Eastern style of
living. Now, tor the first time
in ﬁve years 1 live in a town
where the cars run. Hurrah for
the cars, Hurrah, Hurrahl”

Grinnell had many trains
traveling through until rela-
tively recently. in 1953, the last
passenger train on the north-
south line was dropped. The
students on campus ilagged
down the “Doodlebug" on what
they thought was its last run
and served the crew and the
passengers doughnuts and cof<
lee. Until last Summer the
freiglits ran twice a day from
Marshalltowu to Peoria, and
smith campus residents with
one o'clock classes often had
to watch the train go by.

Swimmers Win 6
0f l4 Con’resis
In Knox Relays

On December 1, the Grinnell
swimming team competed in
the 15th annual Knox Relays,
and won six of fifteen events.
Gi‘innell teams also took second
in four events. No all-around
team scores were kept at this
meet,

Uniortunately, however, this
hopetul earlyrseasdn rodomon.
tade does not quite tell the
whole story. Grinnell still lacks
depth in the allrimportant
sprint races, whereas Mon-
mouth, who was undefeated in
dual meets last season, looks
nearly as strong as ever in this
area. Lawrence, who won the
conterence meet last spring,
did not come to the Knox Re-
lays this year. Cornell, who did
come, looks much improved.

Six Pioneers Make

Despite the Pioneers' 3-5

have impressed the rest or
the conference with the large
number 01 players Grinnell
placed on the All-Midwest
Squads. or the six chosen,
the only Grinnell player
picked for the ins: team
was 1968 CoCaptain Don
Kraitsik as a defensive half-
back. “Bobbie Don" Lillis,
another 1968 C0»Captain, was
a second team chmce as
tackle on oilense and de-
tensc. He was the only player
iiom any school to make the
all-conference team both 017
feiisively and defensively.
Other players making the
Second All-Midwestern Con-
ference unit on offense were:
senior John Wintel‘sonﬁnd,
1968 CorCaptain, senior Jon
Buswell, back, and Senior
Brian Barnesiback. Tom
Lower, a Senior, made the
Second defensive team at the
linebacking spot.

been received.

Timothy McKlbben, son or
Professor and Mrs. McKib-
ben, was killed in an accident
in the Swiss Alps early last
summer, but his body was

Hedger, assisted by Frank
Thomas, at St, Paul's Episcopal
Church last Wednesday, De-

He never came down

to age

and walk on safer ground
and treasure

the memory of what he saw.

So, time will never dim,
for him,

what others lose,

or never had,

or never seek.

He possessed it,
with so much more,
when the earth,
not the vision,
deceived him.

Faculty Delays
Adding Students
To Admissions

,.4 Student representation on the
Admissions Committee was dls<
cussed and voted on at l fac-
ulty meeting Monday. Th
Committee on Faculty Organi-
zation recommended almost
full student representation on
the Admissmns Committee. A1-
thougli the iacuity was general-
ly in favor oi student represen-
tation, it voted against the pro-
posal. Because or concern over
revealing Confidential files on
applicants to students, it dia
rected the Faculty Organiza<
tion Committee to study tiie
idea more and submit a new
proposal aiter the semester
break.

At the well attended meeting,
extreme disagreement was we
pressed irom both sides, and
debate on the issue lasted for
almost the total of the two
hour meeting, The iinal vote,
which failed or a majority was
42 to 34, with many abstentions.

The proposal ol the Faculty
Organization Committee cov<
ered two areas The commit-
tee recommended that students
be given full representation on
the Admissions Committee con-
cerning policy matters. Con-
cerning student participation in
the deciding of special cases
which do not fall within the
policy guidelines, the commit-
tee recommended that Student
members be given voting rep«
resentation but not full access
to the confidential files of ap-
phcants.

The difficulty on this second
point centered on privacy or
files and Whether students
should be allowed to see con-
fidential recommendation and
medical forms, The commit-
tee's proposal on this question
seemed to he a compromise be
tween giving the student mem-
bers voting rights with tull ac-
cess to ﬁles and no voting rep-
resentation at all. Although, ac-
cording to one faculty member,
a good case was made for the
“coding" of information (using
symbols tor proper names)
from confidential forms, the
mood or the iaculty at Mon-
day’s meeting was apparently
towards not allowing any rep-
resentatlon in this area, and
the Committee on Faculty 0P
ganizatioii is expected to come
up with a new preposal of that
nature.

Because of the length of the
discussion on the Admissions
Committee, the iaculty heard
an abbreviated version of Mr.
Magee's report on me Student
Aflairs Committee. his report,
submitted now because he will
M on leave next semester,
called the faculty's role in the
present polarity oi student. and

The Semester’s End

The semester has been a tempes-
tuous one. There was the Schneirov
trial, the declarations of home rule,
the President’s proposal on visitations,
the addition of students to faculty
committees, and the course evaluation
form. For every extraordinary event
that happened, countless routine ones
occurred. But history is concerned
with the ”great and wonderful deeds
of men," and a newspaper is con<
cerned with what is new, whether it
be great and wonderful or ugly and
base, It is generally through what is
extraordinary and unusual that we
come to an appreciation of an era.

Students have shown the charac-
teristics of students everywhere. They
may have become famous for their
more sensational and foolish deeds,
but they have also done a few con-
structive things. Events that are sen-
sational, such as scandals having to do
with visitations, may appear often in
the national papers, but they are no
more important than such enterprises
as the Course Evaluation Committee,
which, despite the numerous short-
comings of its evaluation form,
showed a genuine interest in improv-
ing what ought to be the primary con-
cern of the student—his curriculum.

For every good thing that the stu-
dents do, they probably do at least
two bad things, for they are young,
and Zeus’ second urn is twice as large
as his first. But such is the destiny of
students, and of all mankind, and we
should not, perhaps, be too hard on
them.

A Correction

Last week we printed a story on
the meeting of the Humanities Divi-
sion which contained numerous er-
rors. We attributed certain remarks to
Mr. Zitner Which were erroneous. We
reported that professors were invited
to the meeting. The meeting was for
the chairman of the division, the
chairman of the division's E.P.C., and
junior and senior maiors only. For our
errors, unintentional yet serious, we
apologize.

The Last Editorial

An editor’s first editoral has the
characteristics of youth — it is more
idealistic than it ought to be, it re-
veals impossible expectations, and it
often falsely assumes a knowledge of
men’s motivations. An editor’s last
editorial has the marks of old age—it
is cynical, and the editor, having been
frustrated in his expectations more of-
ten than not, and having discovered
the weakness of the word in influenc-
ing the behavior of men, and having
learned, as Aristotle said, that most
human things turn out to be worth not
much, usually complains of the lack
of support given his newspaper.

In this, my last editorial, I shall
neither deny that I have been frus-
trated in my expectations, nor shall
I complain that working on the news-
paper has been unrewarding and
miserable. I shall simply whisper my
gratitude to those who helped this
newspaper to appear.

The people of Buildings and
Grounds, who generously allowed us
a use of the college wagon and
helped us to overcome bureaucratic
obstacles in obtaining the car, are
thanked. I thank the countless peo-
ple who, because I myself do not
know how to drive, drove me to
Newton, where our paper is printed.
Mr. Turek, and the other printers,
must be thanked for putting up with
our youthful and inexperienced in-
competence.

Our many writers, who had to
endure moderately strict deadlines
and my own grouchiness, are thanked
for their dedication and tolerance.
John Gardner and Mark Sableman,
who showed great zeal and willing-
ness to do news stories, are particular—
ly acknowledged, Thanks go also to
Don Hooker and Sue Miller, who, dur-
ing my first week with the S&B, pro-
vided advice and many hours of as-
sistance to the new editor, who had
no previous experience in journalism,
except for the publication of the David
M. Gibson Memorial Newsletter. To
the others who helped with headlines,
proof-reading, and general advice, I
give my sincere thanks.

No thanks can signify the extent
of my gratitude to Katherine New-
kirk, the managing editor, for her ex-
cellent work,

Well, to the new editor, Susan
Kaeser, I wish good luck, and to all, a
pleasant vacation.

BRIDGE: POST MORTEMﬁ

Hy .iOl-llv GORDLEY

For those who still have last
week's paper, try counting the
errors made by the author as
a test of your awareness of the
absurd. Then add one for allow-
ing the “boy wonder” to Write
the column in the first place.

To finish off the semester
properly, here is a description
of new conventions and plays
invented by the bridge enthu-
slasts of the Forum.

1) The Goftlieb 3 Spadesl
played by Marcus Goulieb,
holder of the Alpha Bridge Cen-
ter Booby Prize. After a one
spade bid by partner, lump (0
three spades with less than live
points and three spades below
the ten in hand.

2) The Shaw Club Coup: or-
lginated by John Shaw, distin-
guished Classical Languages
major, this play involves lead-
ing a low club from hoard miss-
ing the Ace»King. When the op
poneni in second position plays
low, cover with the Queen in
hand. When the other opponent,
who hasn't been paying aiien~
flan, asks who played this

Queen, immediately inform him
that It was his panner and take
the trick us he plays low from
his King.

a) The Mannheimer 2-sult fl-
nesse; initiated by the lamoul
Des Moines miracle, this spa.
cializecl play requires the Ace.
Queen oi Spades and low dia-
menu: In hands and low spade!
and the AcerQueen of diamond:
on the board. [inadvertently
leading a low spade instead of
diamond, and seeing it covered
by the Jack, play the Queen 01
diamonds in hopes that the 0px
position won’t notice.

4) The Gottlieb Twoway FL
hesse: after having successful-
ly flnessed the King of Hearts
from board to hand, lead a low
heart to the jack in dummy.
hoping to catch the opponent
with the King off guard.

These are only a few or the
many variations brazenly at.
tempted this semester in the
Forum. But with the limitless
imagination 01 our players, the
possibilities for unortho-
dox bridge are excellent for
next year.

tellers lo the Editor

Approves Bangel‘l’s

‘Freedom of Speech'

To die Editorl

i would like to applaud Mr.
Bangert for the line sentiment
shown in his letter to the S“!
of Nov. 29, I also believe that
it is the duly oi every member
or the community lo express his
beliefs, however contrary these
might be lo the opinions of the
community at large. This is one
of the reasons that I feel that
students who are dissatisfied
with the nature of the social
and academic atmosphere of
Grinnell College have a “right
and a responsibility" to seek an
elimination of the archaic
values (morality, if you will)
upon which this institution seems
to rest.

i do have a “sneakng suspi-
cion that morality is important,"
but i also have a sneaking sus-
picion that when one attempts
to impose his morality on others
one may find himself ”convert-
ing the infidel" or “making the
world safe for Democracy."
While i don’t wish to go on re-
cord as completely condemning
all attempts at moral activism,
I wlll cite the fact that the great»
est sins perpetrated upon man<
kind were misguided attempts
of men who felt it was their
duty to correct the wrongs of
society. But please don't con-
fuse the opinions of the outspok-
en majority (if i may call them
ihat) with such attempts io im-
pose a morality on the entire
student body, They are only
seeking to eliminate artiﬁciality
of a system which divests them
oi freedom and encourages ir-
responsibility (for freedom en—
tails responsibility), and this in-
dlvniual freedom is not synon»
immls with a lack oi morality.
Certainly all signiﬁcant human
activlty involves moral deci-
sions. Society seeks in place
those incapable of making such
decisions correctly in its eyes

(which like human eyes aren't
perfect) into prison or mental
institutions. While Grinnell
might bare a resemblance lo
both aforementioned vehicles, it
doesn't profess in be either.
Theoretically it should (Within
legal institutional iimits—nelil’h
er oi which are as rigorous as
our Student Handbook would
lead one to believe) grant its
reasonably intelligent and ma-
lure student body at least that
degree of freedom to which it
is entitled by the society apart
from Grinnell.

Admittedly in some areas it
grants us more, for which we
should be thankful, but it should
strive to change those aspects
which are deficient. Every stu-
dent, regardless oi his opinion,
should have something to say
while such changes are under~
taken and l lirmly agree wilh
Mr. Bangert that everyonu
should speak out.

Judges Ethics, Social

To the Editor:

I must express my personal
opinion of the merit of tho
seminar in ethical discussion
course, especially the insiruo—
wr's role as a resource person in
the field of group dynamics.
We were not limited to any
one method of Class discussion.
I looked forward to the evening
meetings just to see what Haas

this time. Then they did some-
thing really revolutionary, i
think H they asked us what
we wanted to do. And we did

Tn Ihe Editor:

It has come to my attention
that you have written a poem
about me which is appearing
in the Christmas Supplement or
The Scarlet and Black this
week. I want you to know that
I am indeed honored and
touched by your action, for i
never thought I was worthy of
a poem.

I must admit that I have not
had much time to read the
newspaper this semester, but it
is not because I didn’t like it.
Indeed, 1 hardly saw it, tor r
was always busy studying,
which, after all, is the duty of

I A Senior's Last Glance at Grinnell

By ANDREW ROTHSTEIN

As I leave Grinnell, I am
aware of two contradictory the-
matic schemes which are vying
ior that honored place in my
mind which will be my memory
of this school, of the two, the
one that expresses my disap»
pointment, an inevitable disap-
pointment after being told that
Grinnell is the Harvard oi the
Midwest," draws upon concrete
dissatisfactions [or its strength.
The other, the more positive re-
membrances, seems composed
completely of intangibles.

Paramount is the decay that
pervades the campus. The sick-
ening bourgeois uniiormity and
acceptance ct that uniformity is
the primary danger Grinnell
must face in the near future.
Too many students have come
here with either no foundations
or with a rigiditied corpus of
dogma that they refuse to re-
view. Neither allows tor growth.
The former case results in in-
secure, self-conscious efforts to
be "in." These are the students
who cannot rebut even the most
primitive challenges to their
newly - adopted creed. They
merely stand sputtering and em-
barrassed. Opposed in suriace
manifestations to those psuedu-
Leitisls—Rightists, and this is
the shame of Grinnell, are the
inarticulate but loud New Lelt—
ists and Archaic Righlists. Both
are so sure of themselves that
they babble on and on using
erudite commonplaces. While
these people have a superiicial
understanding oi the terms they
use, they cannot persuade any-
one: simply because they either
Cannot trace the fundamental
roots of their belieis or these
roots have long since died. Typi—
cal oi this dilemma is the ire-
quent resort to “You know "
in any case. there is no eifnrt to
come to an in-depth comprehen—
sion at the problems that are to
be attacked, nor are examined
the contradictions that will arise
irom the assumedly remedial
hocus-pocus.

Parallel to this stagnation of

the student body is the encrust-
ed ambiguity/deceit of the Ad.
ministration which does not treat
as students as people capable of
learning from experience. Con-
frontation between Establishe
ment and student uncoordina-
tion has been avoided as much
as possible through the use or
ruses and diversions that have
sewed only to cloud the issues

and obscure the formers Stand.
The ﬁnal proof of the Adminis-
tration's desertion of the pro-
iessed goals of this college is the
new P. E. Complex that has
taken precedence over the up-
dating oi the Library and the
expansion of the teaching staff.

Still, Grinnell is in that mur-
ky era through which all in-
stitutions must wander. The
grandeur that it was maintains
a relatively high level or class-
room education; but unless the
etiorts or faculty and students
to shore up the collapsing sys-
tem and to inject new Vitality
succeed, Grinnell will become
the France of American higher
education. Two things make me
pessimistic about Grinnell's fu-
ture in this respect, The faculty
is [00 conservative; the students
are quitters. The incident at the
crosses on central campus last
semester passed like some
amusing joke—the students, by
not following it up, gave the im»

Acting Good in The Dutchman

By ELEONORE SPIEGEL

LeRol Jones' Dutchman is not a piece of work to be taken light-
ly, though it contains some hysterically funny lines, because it
brings to mind serious questions about current movements among
black people. From the moment white Lula (Debbie Abbott)
swings her sexy little self into the seat next to black Clay Williams
(Grady Murdock), she begins to mock him. She taunts his clothes,
his mind, his manhood; in fact. she finds something with which to
humiliate him in everything he does and says. Clay tolerates Miss
Abbott’s quick and clever shifts from sexy to scornful to hateful
as long as he can. He humors her outbursts and accepts her invi-
tations. But even the good-humored character Mr. Murdock p0
trays has a breaking point; and Lula's taunts about his unsophis-
ticated black ancestors seem to snap something inside him. Be-
cause Mr. Murdock's acting is so good and because we have seen
how Miss Abbott has brought him to that point, the sudden transi-
tion that Clay makes from the quiet, middlerclass Negro to the
angry black is believable; and the stream of abuse Clay pours
torth so passionately does not take us by surprise.

Whether Jones intended it or not, the play up to this point bears
a certain resemblance to Negro history in America. injustice aiter
injustice throughout the years has sometimes resulted in an hyster-
ical anger welling up in black people. When that violent anger
takes possession of a man, his worse nature. as Jones says in the
play. demands, indeed needs, revenge. It is too late at that point
for reason and religion to work their beneficial inﬂuence. As Jones
says, if you force a man who is violently angry to submit to reason,
he will only murder with rational explanations.

Two questions arise troni these considerations. First, is a man
who is driven to loss of self-Control by injustice culpable tor the
bad actions which he does While his anger sways him? Secondly,
what will the result of his actions be? Dutchman does not deal
with the iirst question. but it gives some answer to the second.
While Clay is pourlng out his indignation, Lula becomes more and
more hateiui. When the outburst is over and clay is preparing to
leave the subway, Lula suddenly slabs him to death. Violence,
Jones seems to be saying, even the violence of righteous and pas-
sionate anger, breeds more violence and more injustice — a point
which those who wish to be in the grip of such hysterical anger
might well consider.

Given the play they chose, the Ex-loco players are to be com-
mended ior their excellent acting. Because I have it on good
authority that Grinnell actors want to be criticized on their pre-
sentations, I have racked my brains to find flaws with Miss Ab-
butts and Mr. Murdoch’s performances and can oifer only a
couple or suggestions. Miss Abbott might have made more of a
contrast between Lola's theatrical and genuine emotions; what
seemed to be the real Lula Coming through in moments of diSv
gust or hate did not appear very different from the sexy. teasing
Lula. And, in the ﬁrst act, Mr. Murdock was a little too middle-
class and couegiate to be convincing.

Variety Sets Tone F or Concert

By MELISSA HAYS

The members of the Ensemble Contemporara, Mr. and Mrs.
Patrick Purswell and Mr. and Mrs. Paul Zonn, played ior a small
but enthusiastic audience Friday night.

First on the program were iive capricoios for oboe and piano
by Ursula Mamlok. Composed in 1968, these pieces received one
or their first performances Friday night. Because of their variety
of effects and wide range of dynamics, 1 found them more inter-
esting than the Music for Oboe and Piano by Alan Stout.

In the composition of Five Pieces for Piano, Pulitzer Prize
winner George Coremb used the stringrplucking technique with
great success. The diiiiculty in the pertcrniance of these pieces
lies in the detailed notation that must be carefully followed. Also,
a sophisticated pedal technique is required to sustain certain
notes longer than others which have the same attack point. The
first piece was played inside the instrument, achieving a myste-
rious, ethereal effect, whereas the last was played both on the
keys and directly on the strings, the tension increasing with the
shortening of the intervals between inside and Outside playing,

Mosaik, by the Swiss composer Hans Ulrich Lehmann, allows
the performer more freedom than the Crumb work. Many “ges~
lures” (comparable to “phrases") are carelully notated by the
composer, but their arrangement is left to the performer who
seeks to give them the proper balance. This is not to say that such
a piece is easily performed. The timbral qualities of the clarinet
are fully exploited, and the microlonal trills and the double and
multiple-stops require a great deal of mastery. A ilute solo, Se-
quenza, by Berio was similar to the Lehman in its use of timbral
effects.

Last on the program was an improvisation, the Aksorber. Al-
though events appeared and were imitated in all the parts, there
were no definite pitches or time values assigned. Thus, while a
unity was maintained by playing within certain restrictions, the
players were allowed a great deal oi ireedom in the interpretation
of their parts. Many humorous moments were provided by various
whines, honks and rumbles. A tape recorder was used to either
play pre-recorded sounds or to play back the music that it had just
recorded. These were played forward or backward, straight or
distorted. E h player showed a sensitivity and awareness at the

es as they had throughout this fine perlormence.
