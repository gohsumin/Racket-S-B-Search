Frosh Indicate Potential Majors.
High School Activities. interests

college major pretereuces and
high school activities 01 the Grin-
nell class of 1969 were announced
this week by Dale Terry, Grin»
nell's acting dean of admissions

Dominating the treshmen’s ma-
jor choices were the social scien-
ces and literature, attracting 25
per cent and 15 per cent respec-
tively. These iigures contrast with
those of the freshman of the class
of ’68, 31 per cent of whom were
interested in the social sciences
and 9 per cent in literature. in
pre-med the percentage dropped
tram 12 per cent to only 5 per
cent or this year’s ireshmen.

The most striking diiierence be-
tween the two classes is in the fine
arts, which attract 10 per cent of
the class of '69 compared with 2
per cent of the class of ’68.

More freshmen this year plan to
enter mathematics or the physical
sciences. In math. the iigure for
this year’s class, 9.5 per cent, is
up 3.5 per cent over last year’s.
A preterence tor the physical
sciences was expressed by 8 per
cent of the members of the class
of '69, while only 3 per cent of
last year's ireshmen preferred the
sciences.

The two classes were identical
in some iields with 9 per cent in
languages, 3 per cent in biological
sciences and 5 per cent in pre-
law.

Students for Democratic Society
fie/ii Discussion for interested’

By MARY MALCOLM

“Does anyone have a car that
they would like to take to Ala»
hama tomorrow morning—there
might be a demonstration and ii
there isn’t, there are always all
kinds of things to do there,” said
Grinnell student Bill Barnes in all
seriousness at the Wednesday
night meeting in South Lounge of
students “interested in” the Stu-
dents ior a Democratic society.

Very little business penetrated
the anti-organizational mood or
the meeting. Questions as to the

aims or ms were dismissed by
veteran members.

“It’s almost easier to tell about
the aims oi the individual project
because SDS is kind or nebulous."
Jean Vandervoort, past vice pres-
ident of the Grinnell chapter said.

The closest anyone came to de-
fining the {unction oi the group
was Nancy McCannon, who said
that the structure included three
parts: the indigenous movement
which concerns itself with com-
munity organization or poor peo-
ple; the peace movement which
sponsored last spring's March on

Washington protesting the Viet
Nam situation; and the campus
movement which played a role in
the Free Speech Movement at
Berkely and protests college ada
ministrative “in loco parentis”
policies.

Aims of individual projects were
discussed by students who took
part in summer projects directly
or indirectly connected with SDS.

Grinnell College C oe

A sociological survey was con-
ducted last spring of the sexual
attitudes and practices of Grinnell
women. The survey sampled 100
women lrom all classes in approX<
imately equal proportions

Some of the conclusion drawn
by the Kinsey-like survey were:

I. Ninety-eight per cent or the
sample had engaged in some
type of petting.

2. Twenty-three per cent had
experienced sexual intercourse.

3. A greater percentage oi in-
dividuals felt that intercourse
would be acceptable for them
than had experienced it.

4. The number who have pet-
ted and have had intercourse
increases with the year in school.

5. Sixty-one per cent of the inn

 

dividuals felt that their attitudes
toward sex have become more

liberal since entering college.

6. Individuals with no relig-
ious beiieis have a higher per-
centage of both petting and
intercourse than individuals with
Protestant beliefs and among
Protestants, the amount of sex-
ual activity increases with de-
creased participation in the
church. Samples from other re«
iigions were too small to draw
conclusions.

The survey used Kinsey's delin—
ition of petting. it was deﬁned as
“physical contacts which involve
a deliberate attempt to eiiect
erotic arousal."

The ninety-eight per cent of Grin-
nell women who had engaged in

 

some kind of petting compared
with ninetyone per cent at a simi-
lar age, education, and social
background in the Kinsey report
published 12 years ago.

Kinsey's definition included kiss-
ing. When the various categories
of kissing were removed irom what
might be considered petting, 77 per
mm oi the Grinnell women had
potted,

The percentage of Grinnell girls
who had engaged in sexual inter-
course was twenty-three per cent,
as compared to twenty per cent
tor a group of women at similar
age, education, and social back-
ground in the 1953 Kinsey report.

The report showed that {or all
areas of sexual activity a Grinnell
girl is more Inclined to participate

in that activity with someone the

survey called a “steady date."
This percentage was higher than
that with a "fiance,” notably be-
cause the report showed that a
low percentage of Grinnell wom-
en have ever had a fiance,

The report said that “the indi-
viduals whose attitudes were more

opportunity, tear of the activity or
its consequences, lack of an ap-
propriate setting, and uncertainty
about attitudes as the factors re-
sponsible [or the diiierence.”

Sequeiro Explains Aid Plans.

,‘Finonces Remain Adequale' ‘

By ALAN AXELROD

' The financial needs of Grinnell
students are adequately provided
for in monetary giits awarded by
the college in the iorm of scholar»
ships and grants~lnvaid. .
“No!” you say? Leforne Sequel-
ra, director of placement and stu-
dent aid, thinks so and further
believes that the story about thou-
sands ol dollars in scholarship
tunds going unused is a myth.
"We use every penny at the funds
that are alotted to us," he said.
This year 124 ireshmen are get—
ting gifts. and the average award
is $783, while last year 163 fresh~
then received an average or $775.
These totals represent outrand»out
gifts and do not include loans or
campus employment. While the
number of ireshman scholarships
went down, the number of fresh»
men went up, from 356 to 372.
However, Sequeira says that there
is no discrepancy in these figures.
“Once accepted, every student
who applies for an needs finan-

 

cial assistance gets it,” he said.
Last year the college had $367,000
available for financial assistance.
The total went down this year to
$350,000. “However, these figures
are misleading.” he insisted. “Sev-
eral scholarship funds instituted a
few years ago have exhausted
themselves.”

“There is a continual turnover in
funds available irom year to
year,” he said. When gifts pres
vided by outside sources are not
adequate, the college must dig in.
to its own income to make up
the difference. When the college
does this, however, there is less
available for the educational en»
terprise, and during years of heavy
outlay of funds for such improve-
ments as the Forum and the new
science wing, the college some-
times finds itself in a bind.

Sequelra predicted that next year,
however, there will be $370,000
readily avallable, and the college
will be doing a better job iii needs
analysis.

during my marathon study break
(now elitllng its second week), I saw a war mOVle
on television, The name oi the movie doesn't really

in case you missed this gem, We recorded it below.

The scene was on the bridge oi a large aircraft

Admiral — a prep school and college chum, the best
man at his wedding, God lather at his son — has

died in a mission led by the lesser rank. . .

“But was your mission in good judgment?”

"Admiral, we completely destroyed the bridge
and still had bombs left over. You know the un-
written rule — never return unless you’ve used all
your bombs. We hit the secondary target and killed
untold numbers or enemy troops who were living
in those village homes. it was a good mission, Ad-

Ed. note: The iullowing letter

the Fifth Year Abroad program
at Dara Academy, Chiengmsi,
Thailandt

Although i feel as if I've been
here “forever." i find it hard to
believe that its September, that
summer in the U.S. is over, and
that Classes at Grinnell have be-
gun, in ways it seems that it was
just a short time ago tllat I ar-
rived in Chiengmai, got used to
being stared at by the students,
became accustomed to having
dogs, chickens (sctawny ones, at
that), and birds going in and out
or the classroom at will, eating
new and different foods, and mak»
ing adjustments to other things
that make life nin in a little
different manner over here, i
blithely began teaching thinking
i “knew" English, but soon Iealr
ized that just because i spoke it,
it didn't necessarily mean that i
knew it or that I Could teach it
wtthout preparation. It was some-
times easy to go to class at Grin»
nell unprepared, but i iind that it
is a little harder to teach when
you're unprepared! Alter getting
somewhat settled in a groove
which was fairly free of obstacles.
l was able to see more of Chieng.
mai, which interested me much
more than did teaching,

Chiengmai, 543 miles north at
Bangkok, is the second largest
city in Thailand with a population
of 100,153 (1960 census) Within the
City limits. Chiengmai is sur
rounded by mountains and the
valley is quite icrtile. Most of the
people are iarmers. Besides grow-
ing much rice, soybeans, and pea-
nuts, Chiengmai is noted for its
fruit. 1 might add that it is also
noted for its pretty girls and kind
people, facts which I learned from
correcting about 300 compositions!
Right now we are in the middle
or the rainy season, the tinie when
rice is planted and everything is
very green and lush. it doesn’t
ruin all the time, but it usually
manages at least mice a day or
else it might rain quite steadily
for a day or two and then be
iollowed by a beautitul siinny
day—it varies, and you can never

 

count on it being one way or the
other. I'm getting quite used to
riding my bike to my Thai langur
age class in the rain and am
finding it a Challenge to keep
irom getting splashed.

One of the things that struck
me most when Larrived was [he
traiiic. It's like you've never seen
belore and your llle is at stake
whenever you venture forth. The
streets are crowded W|th bicycles,
cars, buses, trucks, 3-wheeled m0~
torized taxls, pedicahs (man pow-
ered taxis), Hondas. and even
some ox carts. i think the Thai
have a philosophy that says that
the other driver has a steering
wheel and brakes and is Capable
oi using them. when everyone
thinks this way it can sometimes
lead to interesting results. They
pass anytime they wish and hook
then‘ horns at Corners instead 0i
slowing down. I don’t think any
one listens to these hcrns, but
maybe they do. Anyway, it is sort
of fun to manllever in the traffic.

i was also struck by the many,
many little shops that line the
street and seem to be selling the
same thing. I wonder how anyone
makes a living. When I think of
these shops a picture of the red
and white of the Colgate tooth
paste. the red, blue, and white oi
a box or Feb, and the orange oi
Ovaltine can come to mind. These
three companies seem to have
made a “hit" in Thalland. Then
there is the market which is
"something else" and proves dif-
iicult to describe. in it are many
little booths where everything is
sold. You can close your eyes and
tell where you are by the smell—
the meat market, cosmetic, etc,
The food market is probably the
most interesting, for so many of
the foods are new to me and l’m
fascinated by their looks and their
odors. If you like to bargain and
are adept at it, you can have lots
or tun haggling over prices. The
best time to go is early in the
morning when everyone is buying
food. We oiten go there at 6:30
tor breakiatt where, besides eating
interesting iood. you see lots oi
interesting people. it's quite a
colcritil place. and, needless to
say. diflerent ironi “shopping cen-
ters" at home.

 

i don’t want to bore you, so this
is all [or this letter. Please write
it you have any question, espec-
ially ii ynll are interested in com<
ing next year. I’d enjoy hearing
irom any of you.

Parsons, Antioch
Suffer Dissension

By PAUL BRADLEY

Faculty ~ student antagonism at
Antioch College worsened this
summer when Mary Hunt, direc.
tor of Antioch’s extramural de-
partment, resigned, She leit be-
cause, “i iind it increasingly on.
ticult to accept the living stand-
ards and behavior patterns of our
students. .1 believe we will
make no progress until a strong

-leadership makes clear the stand-

ards we intend to foster and en—
courage,"

Examples of student behavior
were brought to light, The casual,
loiltngonthe-iloor, manner or Au—
tioch students attending a lecture
by a visiting philosophy protessor
and the loss of nine hundred books
a year from the library were
cited.

A proposition is being considered
by the student government to SilSr
pend Antioch’s honor system and
impose these restrictions:

1. A guard at the library.

2. Suspension of open hall hours.

3. Proctored exams in classes.

4. Enforcement of strict dress
standards in the cafeteria.

Dissension is also heard in the
surrounding community, where,
according to the Antioch newspa-
per, students have tound it on —
cult to secure adequate oftcampus
housing. The remnant of the Ollie
Kll Klux Klan has threatened in
“run Antioch out of Ohio.”

Parsons College is also having
problems with the local commlm»

town welcomes the college's spend-
ing power, but substandard holis-
ing oil-campus for the students is

Dull Summer Replaced b y Excitement of Service, Tri

By CYNTHIA BRUST

“‘1?” did you do this sum-
moi" This traditional Grinneil
ice-breaker and New Students
Days time-killer often leads to in~
temsting results. Aside from a
date with that heat boy, you
might also find yourself discussing
trips to Europe or social service
projects, as well as life in a fac-
tory and the speed of summer
school classes.

"Vacationing" Grinnellians sat
in classrooms from coast to coast,
and then some. Some took classes
for fun, and some used the oppor~
tunity to fulfill requirements for
graduation or for teacher certiii-
cation. Judy Roberts, senior, was
one of the few lucky ones whose
summer school was far more than
classes, for she studied in France
Ind lived with a French family.
Tarra Hookham, senior, studied in
California at an artist’s colony un-
081' Marguerite Wildenhair, one
of the world's leading potters.

Several summer opportunities
Ire provided by various depart-
ments at Grinnell, and provide ac-
ademic credit, a salary, or both.
Typical of these is the nineweek
program at a biology field station
in northern Minnesota, attended
this year by Dave lines and Shar-
on Sheumaker, seniors, and Peg
Gerber, junior. Careers in social
work provided jobs and practical
axperience in the field for Holly
Hoebel, senior, and Beth Whit-
tnore, junior, who worked in Chi-
lagu and Cleveland, respectively.

Nine weeks of teaching at Le-
Moyne College earned credit for
practice teaching for Rin Yeisley

 

and Barb Plager, as well as conr
tinuing one important area of the
college’s exchange program with
Grinnell. Steve Shender and
George Wittgraf and Steve Kent,
juniors. worked in Washington,
D.C. as this year’s PPPE interns.

For those who found working a
necessity during the summer, a
wide range of usual and unusual
jobs were ﬁlled by Grinnellians.
Jim Drasdo, junior, teaching surf-
ing at a Hawaiian hotel, and Steve
Tilly, working on a farm in
France, Cﬂver the eeremes. Grin-
nelilans also served as lemon pick-
ers (Janet Poland, sophomore).
French teachers (Jim Bruce, jun~
ior, at Phillips Exeter), and re-
search assistants (Jane Flad, jun-
inr, in a cancer research lab). The
workings of the theatre drew at
least two Grinneli girls; Pat
Smith, a freshman who worked
backstage at the Santa Fe Opera.
and Melinda Ward, junior, who
worked in the box»ottice at the
summer theatre in Nyack, N.Y.

Dave D o n a h o o, sophomore,
whose official title was Grain Sam-
pler I for the State of Minnesota,
took samples of boxcar: of grain,
in order to fix price and quality of
the grain. Jim Wilson, sopho-
more, sprayed Chicago area parks
and forest preserves for the mos-
quito abatement program. Gary
Wilson, senior, may take the
year's award for most desirable
job; he was ticketman for the
girlie show at the all-Iowa Fair at
Cedar Rapids.

New York drew many Griiinell
students who desired a change
from the cornfields of Iowa. Anne

Hoganson, Joan Lovejoy, and
Dotty Dosse. seniors, all were
able to find office jobs aiter they
reached the city. Barry Ancona,
junior, worked with an advertising
agency. Janice Bahl, junior, lived
in Greenwich Village, worked,
and took part in seminars on the
role of the church in urban so-
ciety — part of an interdenomina-
tional program for some 20 col-
lege students, sponsored by the
Judson Memorial Church in New
York.

The Wanderlust of the Grinnell
students took them to many
places, under many guises. Louie
Pearce, senior. helped build a
hospital in Kenya, Africa, work
ing with a Crossroads Africa proj-
ect. Betsy Burr, senior, worked
as a secretary for Monsanto
Chemicals, Ltd, in London. A bout
with malaria almost ruined the
exciting summer of Sigma Hanson,
senior, who traveled through
Russia as well as “staying home"
with her family — in Pakistan.
Bill Fernbaoh, senior, serving as
an officer’s messman of the 55
Atlantic, traveled to Casablanca,

 

Naples, Genoa. Carine, and Bar-
celona. Betty Stanek’s tour of
Europe was sponsored by a uni-
versity, and concentrated on the
art attractions of the Continent.
Jeanne Beck toured Europe in a
group that travelled by Volkswagen
bus and camped. others who trav-
eled and/or worked on the conti-
nent include Char Buss, Mimi
Madara, Debbie Downs, Paula
Stephen, Anne Sprague, Mike Fort,
Eric Jacobson, Bill Colbert, Hugh
Mullenbach, Nancy Rockwell, Muf-
fie Meyer, Linnea Ellison, and
Carla Overherger.

Other Wanderers include Dale
Massey, sophomore, who left
campus utter his finals last spring
and rode his bicycle to Washing»
ton, Dc. Taking a days, Massey
hiked a total of 850 miles, hitching
a ride on a pick-up truck through
central Illinois. Trip Kennedy,
sophomore, Janet Owens, senior,
and Jim Drasdo were among the
Grinnellians whose travels took
them to Mexico.

Each year, an increasing num-
ber of college students iind jobs
that provide a social service, or

 

volunteer their summers to var-
ious programs. Christie Nute, jun-
ior, worked as a public health In~
tern in Boston, assisting with a
statewide program which did
surveys and educational programs,
and ran mass Clinics in an effort
to vaccinate as great a percent<
age at the population as possible.
Hannah Hollister, senior, and
Trudy Olsen, junior, combined
camp counseling with service,
working at the Easter Seal camp
for the Handicapped near Des
Moines.

Mark Felton, senior, worked in
Muscatine County, Iowa, as one
of two social workers serving 1500
migrant workers who were picking
tomatoes for H. J. Heinz and Co.
His main duties were to compile
family histories for a permanent
central file on migrants, to urge
attendance st the special schools
for the children of the workers,
and to see that persons needing
medical or other special services
were treated.

Suzy Foster, senior, worked with
a Friends‘ Service project in Ore-
gon, and Janet Nichol, sophomore,
lived and worked on u Sioux In<

sponsored by the YMCA. Penny
Bevls and Ted Risser, seniors,
spent the summer working in an
Iowa home for juvenile delin»
quents.

Chicago attracted many of the
service-minded Grinnellians this
summer, as always. Jack Dun-
ning. senior, worked with primary

 

age children {mm the South Side,
while Jean Cook's project, titled
REACH, involved 50 high-school
students from the entire city and
suburban areas. Both of these pro-
grams attempted to provide new
experiences in the arts, commu-
nications and urban life for the
participants. Sarah Vanderwicken,
sophomore. was one of several
Grinnellians who were Involved in
the "War on Poverty," working
with Project Headstart in Chicago.

The Alliance of Yugoslavian

As the result or a continuing

United States. They should have
the full freedom to decide for

Petkovlc commented thoughtful-
ly that a strong, whole Germany
has been the cause of two World
Wars, A new, united Germany
could cause the third. He said that
though France and England claim
they want a united Germany, deep
down they feel dilierently. They
both want to be leading powers
and a reunited Germany would be
athreat.

When asked to comment on Yu-
goslavia’s position on the Russo»
Chinese split, Pelkovic said that
Yugoslavia is constantly split with
somebody, and olten within her-
self. The split, he said, “is has“?
ally in an international labor and
Communist movement." China
thinks war and revolution is the
only way to peace; Yugoslavia‘s
policy is based on active peaceiul
coexistence and the advance of
the world to socialism.

SCARLET AND BLACK

Friday. September I7, I96!

 

 

F

By STEVE CASEY

Congratulations must go to Coach Edd Bowers for the football
preview he put on Saturday. Introducing the players and then showing
the basic Pioneer defenses and olfenses will surely help the Grinnell
tons to enjoy the game. having the cheerleaders show on the gear of
the players was also beneﬁcial and enjoyable to most or the crowd.
Although the game was not overly thrilling, there were a few excit<
lug plays, usually happening when the players had to improvise after
the original play was abandoned.

>I< >‘t< *

At Lawrence a group of alumni and townspeople formed “The
Lawrence Bench" under the co-chairmanship of a local bookseller and
p tormer Little All-American football player. The long-range plan of
this organization is to show appreciation to the College for its cultural
and economic contributions to the community. But right away they are
trying to fill the new 5,400 seat stadium for the opening game. Good
luck. it would take a tremendous upsurge in attendance for the Plu-
neers to get that many people for all four home games.

>l< >1< >l<

The 1965-66 Pioneer sports teams will be out to match the great
success of last year’s teams which captured the conference all-sports
itle. Due to a tremendous surge in the spring sports, the Pioneers took
lhe title with 34 points, one point ahead of Cornell. Then came Carleton
ind St. Olaf, 37; Ripon. 45; Beloit, 54; Monmouth, 57; Coe, 53; Law-
tence, 61; and Knox, 62.

>I< >I< >i‘<

A former football star is the associate director of admissions.
Nick Ryan Ryan holds a prominent position in the Pioneer record
book. In 1954 in a game against Carleton he gained 213 yards which
is the Pioneer record The 743 yards he gained that whole season is
second on the Grinnell list. He is third in career rushing with 1427
yards, fourth in career total offense With 1538 yards, and fifth in career
gcnring with 73 points. He was also ﬁrst team all-conference in 1954.
Maybe with Ryan in admissions we might be able to secure some
mholars who are also star halfbacks.

Grldmeu Feature
Squad PIaloonlng

Keen competition continues at all
positions as the Grinnell gridders
move into the tinal stage oi prac-
tice before their opening game
with Cornell here Sept. 25.

“All in all. we are quite pleased
with our progress," noted Coach
Edd Bowers. "We are further a«
long in some areas than we were
at a comparable stage in past
years," he stated, but cautioned
that “we still have a lot to do."

Bowers will do a lot of pla<
tooning and expects about so Pio-
neers to see heavy action.

“We feel that we have good squad
balanceeat least a couple of good
boys at each position” he related.
“As our newcomers gain experi-
ence, we could be deeper than
last year.”

The interior line, which was
wrecked by graduation, remains
the big question mark. Only three
lettermen—Rick Anderson, Tom
Lannom, and co—captain Paul
Thurston—return, putting a heavy
burden on sophomores.

Lack of size is another problem.
At present, not a single Pioneer
tops the 200 pound mark.

“We are going to have to hit
faster and be more aggressive on
both offense and defense to com-
pensate for our lightness," Bowers
pointed out.

The Scarlet and Black came
through the heavy contact phase
of practice in good shape. Veteran
ends Al Peterson and ‘Nord Brue
and sophomore quarterback Kent
Thomson are the only ones on the
injury list, but none are serious.

Thomson has been pushing Bar-
ry Anderson, last year's regular,
for the quarterback job.

The halfback and fullback jobs
are also being hotly contested.
Bidding for offensive roles at half-
back are three lettermen—corcap-
tain John Shierholz, Dave Syn—
horst, and Bob Watt, who all
turned in good performances in
Saturday's scrimmage.

Pioneers Face
Home Opener

Still hampered in their condi-
tioning by the Continued cold and
wet weather, the Grinnell cross
country runners will make their
first home appearance of the sea-
son today.

The Pioneers will face Drake at
5:00 p.m. in a Smile run over
the Ward Field - Country C l u 12
course.

Last Saturday the harriers ran
ln the State Federation meet at;
Ames, The Pioneers took seven
runners to the meet that included
Iowa State, Drake, and SCI. in
the three-mile race the top finish-
er was Steve Brintnall in ninth
with a time of 16:55. Other run-
ners were Jeri Langham, 11; Rio
MacDowell,15; Doug Dray, 18;
Bob Grant, 20; pick Lovell, 25;
and Spencer Clark, 26, in'the 3%-
runner fIEId. John Sharpe missed
the meet because or a leg injury.

“I’m fairly well satisfied with
the over-all progress of the
squad," coach Dick Young re.
ported. “But this weather contin-
ues to hamper our training. In
two weeks of practice, we still
haven’t had one really good con-
ditioning day."

Young plans to run all eight or
his squad members in the Drake
dual—lettermen Steve Brintnall
and Jeri Langham. and new-
comers John Sharpe, Ric Mao-
Dowell, Doug Dray, Bob Grant,
Dick Lovell, and Spencer Clark.

“Right now, we have three pretty
good runners in Brlntnall, Lang-
ham, and Sharpe." according to
Young. “I’m pleased with their
progress."

“But, we should have seven good
men for a wellrbalanced team and
have to have at. least five,” he
noted.
