Faulwell Named Speaker;
Senate Endorses Interim

By MARTHA BERKEY

Senior Bond Faulwell was
unanimously elected to fill the
resigned speakership of Dan
Bucks at the Senate meeting
Nov. 2, He was nominated by
SGA president Steve Kent and

ran unopposed. in a Statement
distributed to senators prior to

‘ the meeting. Kent cited Faul-

well’s "extensive experience in
student government as a mem-
ber of the Senate and as a
house president? in making his
formal nomination.

This year Faulwell has
served as a dlscussion leader
at Encampment, is a mem-
ber at the Senate Committee
on Academlc Life and has
participated in the planning
[or an interim sesslon at the
beginning or next semester.
After his election he told the
5&1? that he would be con-
cerned immediately primarily
with reviewing the Senate. He
said he (on that the ground
work for action had been laid
and now was the time In em
act ideas.

In the absence ot a speaker,
SGA president Steve Kent pre~
sided. He opened the meeting
with an address on the Senate
and its function in SGA in
which he expressed hope that
the Senate could “ideally" be
a place where student opinion
may be expressed. It would
deal with problems on an am-
bitious scale at the committee
level. He stated that at this
time the solution to problem
does not lie in the creation of
more committees, as the exist-
ing structure is already “awful-
ly ambitious." Kent called for
a “clear definition or objec-
tives" as the next step in com<
mittee runctioning, declaring
that “implementation is nine-
tenths of the battle once they
get an idea."

In other action Wednesday
night, the Senate unanimously
endorsed the proposed interim
session to precede the begin-
ning of second semester. Chair-
man Ric McDowell presented a
tentative outline schedule of

Bond Foulwell

four elective seminars, each of
which would meet three times,
plus tother types or discussions
and activities. The period would
run from Sunday, Jan. 8,
through Sunday, Jan. 15. This
would mean a return to cam-
pus three days early for par-
ticipating Students. Prior to
gaining the Senate‘s support,
the interim proposal had been
very favorably received by the
faculty.

Senate F in a n c 2 Committee
chairman Chuck Wall presented
two proposals, one to raise the
SGA secretaries' salaries and
another concerning Senate sub-
sidy of Langan hall social funds.

An increase in wages from
$.Z5 to $1.00 an hour for the
seven secretaries employed by
SGA was unanimously accepted
after the defeat of an amend-
ment by senator Hank Balikov
to set the ﬁgure at $1.20 per
hour.

Editorial . . .

SGA President Steve Kent’s nomination of Bond
Faulwell to tile Senate Speakel'sl‘iip was a praisewortliy
choice, The Senate badly needs steady, businesslike lead-
ership at this crucial juncture in the college’s life.

Seldom have so many important matters been before
the Senate as at the present time, Sadly, seldom, too,
has tlle organizational control of that august body been
so shaky. Faolwell shows the strongest signs of any of tlle
candidates of being able to straighten out the mess.

It is to be hoped that action on the women‘s hours
rules will pass the Senate in the next week or two and
that action will be taken shortly on several of the other
areas discussed in the October 11 “Extra" edition of the

8&8.

These measures should be weighed carefully, but if
they are to escape the curse of the multitude of innocuous
planning committees of past years, action must be taken

soon.

The 53:13 wishes Faulwell the best of luck in his com-
ing tasks. We reserve the right to be less kind later, how-
ever, if constructive proposals, like last week‘s interim
proposal, for instance, are not soon forthcoming.

Applications are now being accepted for the son Editor-
ship. The new term will run from second semester thru first
Semester, 1966. Applications, which should include a state-
ment oi purpose and suggestions for changes in the son, are
to be sent to H. Y. Steiner, English. Applications are due

A Review

"Gospel" Coming of Strand

By JON MEGIBOW

It seems that there is a very
simple premise upon which all
biblical spectacles are pro-
duced: excesses of money and
special effects are directed
proportionate to overall holi-
ness and religious intensity.
The outstanding products of this
genre are C. B. DeMille’s
“King oi Kings" and George
Stevens‘ “The Greatest Story
Ever Told.” Movies of this
genre begin with a tinioil nim<
bus and end with a Mardi Gras
cruciiixion, leaving the viewer
With a feeling that the Bible
was originally ti Broadway mu-
sical. The justification for this
method is that through the ef—
fects and spectacles the view-
er is given a contemporaneous
representation that he can more
easily assimilate. With Jesus
played by an irate Kirk Douglas
and Salome played by a near-
nude AnnrMargaret the pic-
ture’s intention becomes clear.
Among the many failings of
this genre the worst seems to
be that neither the director nor
the producer has any faith in
the document upon which the
movie is based.

In radical contrast to these
Hollywood fairy tales is a sim~
ple film, The Gospel Accord-

ing to St. Matthew,” which will
be shown at the Strand Theater
November 13716. The director,
Pier Paolo Pasolini, was limit-
ed by a very tight budget but
has turned this to his advan<
tage. There are no professional
actors and ibe setting, southern
Italy, is completely natural.
The most obvious advantage is
that there is no contradiction
between the actor's personality
and acting role. Beyond the
fact that Christ is played by a
Spanish student, Enrique lrazo-
qui, the whole film has an air of
complete, unpretentious S|m<
plicity. Pasollni uses this to his
advantage by concentrating on
the faces of the actors, showing
very little consideration for im-
portance of role. The extras,
generally farmers and workers,
have faces that, in their crude
ness and simplicity, span the
time barrier that separates the
viewer from the action. This
naturalism is reinforced by the
setting. Pasolini uses ancient
slums and near-ruins for the
action, but blends these with
the characters, giving them a
strange beauty. The opening se-
quence has Mary framed in the
ancient archway of her house
and the resulting effect gives
an impression of a delicate
medieval etching. The Last

No Problem Seen

{endorsing/ii monitored at deft

By HAROLD FUSON

“In the University or college
we have a need for art that
leads ~ art that is a little ahead
oi the moresiii we always do
what the public wonts, we will
never progless.” This is how
one University oi Iowa pi-oies—
sor views the role at the arts in
academic life.

Dr. Samuel Becker, Profes-
sor of Speech and Dramatic Art
and Director of TV, Radio and
Films, was more vocal than
some oi the University or lowa
faculty and students the 5&3
talked to last week, but his
views were typical.

Because of the recent censor-

Supper is in a common tavern
where the disciples eat stew
and sit on the dirt floor.

The only dialogue is that at
the Bible, without the super-
iluous interpretations of a scen-
aria The dichotomy between
Christ, the son, oi God, and
Christ, the man, is handled in
an unusual way. Christ‘s actions
and speeches are those of the
son or God, but the setting and
physical appearance or the ac<
tor produces the opposite, hu<
manistic, effect. As Christ ap-
proaches his crucifixion he be-
comes more and more short-
tempered with everyone around
him. The only kindness and
love are for the children. The
miracles are performed without
the typical fanfare and multi-
colored lights. They are under.
toned by the simplicity oi the
language and by the stark, al-
most harren cinematography.

The question of music is dif-
ficult to analyze. Pasolini uses
Bach, Pmkotiev, Odetta, and
the Congolese “Misa Luha."
The only piece that is really out
of place is Odetta's “Some
times I Feel Like a Motherless
Child." But this is because an
Italian audience would not be
involved with the words, only
the Voice. The startling effect
of the “Misa Luba,” and the
music in general, add quite a
bit to the movie.

The deficiencies are amazing
in their pettlness. 0n the whole
the cinematography is quite
good, except for the excessive
use of the telephoto lens. Yet,
there are points where shots
are just sloppy — the camera
skipped a face and then re—
turned quickly, like an uncon-
scious comic duubledake. This
is also true of the editing, al-
most always superb, but care-
less at points. Another draw-
back is not the fault of the
ﬁlm. Inevitably when a movie
is dubbed rather than presented
with sub-titles something is lost.
This is especially true in a film
whose action is so slow-paced
and methodical, where there is
little dialogue.

This film was shown two
weeks ago to religious leaders
tram both college and town
communities. Their opinion
was generally favorable but
don’t use that as an excuse for
not seeing this film. It is worth-
while to anyone who is sick or
u bearded Charlton Heston
throwing plastic tablets from
the mountainside.

ship of a Grillnell student pro-
dilation oi Eugene Ionesco’s
play, The Chairs, the son has
been exploring the problem oi
censorship in all areas of aca-
demic life.

in general, we iound students
at Iowa had little [ear that any
of their serious work might be
censored by University oiiicials.
The faculty indicated that limits
on students' work were consist-
tent with practice in the pl‘oieS<
sional world of art, drama and
photography.

Gate Keeper Needed

Asked about the Grinnell inci-
deni, Dr. Becker said, “All oi
us are against the principle or
censorship.” However, he added,
“Somebody has to be a kind of
gatekeeper,” He said the main
criteria such a gatekeeper must
act upon is taste. He added,
“I mean artistic not moral
taste."

Dl'. Becker said it would be
difficult to say just who the
gatekeeper should be, but “i
don’t think a university presi-
dent can put himseli in the posi-
tion oi censor. The president
must hire faculty with artistic
judgment.”

Ii ihe president is too oiten
at odds with his faculty, Dr.
Becker said, ”He has to get
rid of them and get somebody
else. How can a president who
is not an artist, who is not a
theater man, judge what is
good and bad."

Asked about the impact of
questionable works of art on the
college's image in the outside
world, Dr. Becker said, "Anyone
in an administrative position has
to be extremely careful about
judging a work for the wrong
reasons. it a production is ar-
tistically honest, even if it isn't
the best public relations, the
administration must go along
with it.

“I think obviously an admins
lstrator risks a great deal in
providing this sort of freedom.
It takes a lot of guts to do it. It
has always been recognized that
this ldnd or policy gets you in
trouble sometimes. Bil! in the
truly great colleges and uni-
versities this policy has been
upheld."

Part of Leadership

Dr. Becker indicated that this
risk was part of the college’s
role as a leader. He said "Part
oi the administrator’s job is to
educate the public about what a
college or university is, what
kind of environment it takes to
nurture creativity.”

To its own students the col-
lege has a similar responsibili-
ty, Dr. Becker added. The col-
lege must challenge and broad-
en ihe student's tastes. He said.
“At a place like Grinnell, Iowa,
and Iowa City, Iowa, it is very
important to jar students into
thinking about things they never
thought about. We’ve got to
create an environment that
makes it virtually impossible to
have the same atmosphere that
they had back home.”

All of the persons we talked
to in Iowa City expressed geri-
erat approval of their own ad-

ministration’s attitude .ioward
artistic freedom. Dr. Becker
said, “I think there is as great
a ireetlom here as l‘ve seen,
anti that is one reason the arts
flourish here. This freedom is
very important.”

Dr. DaVld School, Professor
of TeradiorFilm, corroborated
iliis view of the University of
Iowa. “This is the most liberai
school I’ve taught at,” he said.
ln general, he continued, “the
administration has had a clear
attitude toward censorship. They
put their confidence in the
Staff.”

Students Satisfied

Students working in the Uni-
versity art studios also indi-
cated censorship was no prob
lem at Iowa, They acted sur-
prised that anyone was even
concerned about me problem.

Most of them did recall, how-
ever, incidents in which artistic
displays oi questionable moral
implications were removed from
public showing. in all cases,
however, the displays were tak-
en down only temporarily at
times when a great number of
outsiders were on campus. One
graduate assistant said no
thought this was “silly”, but he
seemed unconcerned about it.

To give an idea of the limits
of the artistic freedom at Iowa,
John Schulze, Professor of
Art (Photography), told the 88:3,
“We don’t usualiy permit hu‘
man genitalia to be shown in
public photographic displays
but there have been exception
to this.” He added, “We do
things now we couldn’t have
done two years ago.”

Both photography and art stu-
dents use nude female models
and nearly nude male models.
The models are paid up to $2.50
per hour and are drawn from
both undergraduate and gradu-
ate students

Confidence Important

In setting the limits Dr. Beck.
er again stressed the importance
of the administration’s confi-
dence in its facility.

He said, ”I think If is very
unfortunate ii a faculty mem~
ber acts on beliefs other than
his own — that is from outside
influences. Then you are really
in trouble."

Dr. Becker feels a kind of
"mutual respect between facul-
ty, studentsI and administration”
is necessary for a college or
university to operate well.

Dr. Becker stressed artistic
integrity on the part oi the stu-
dent in preserving this mutual
respect. He said, “I feel that
any honest work the students
want to do, they are free to
do at Iowa."

In respect to producing works
which go strongiy against the
standard mores, Dr. Becker
said, ubright students are obvi-
ously more trouble than stupid
students. It is much easier if
you have students who accept
anything — but how dreadful!”

Perhaps, Dr. Schaal suggested,
“the surest way to cause trou-
ble is to censor something." It
is when students get upset with
what they feel is unfair censor-
ship that newspaper stories he-
gin to appear.

IN THE INTENSE ACTION of "Slow Dance oniho Killing Ground," written by William
Henley, three characters lay bare their dEEpesi“ anxieties. Myron Lowery, a LeMoyne
student who attended Grinnell last semester, and Grinnell students Carli Dugan and

Dale oreytuu acted in the recent production at LeMoyne.

Grimm/I Theater Group .6095
"0n the Road" to let/Mayne

By KRYS NEUMAN

“it was a good experience for
all involved; there Should defi-
nitely he many more exchanges
between Grinnell and LeMoyne
— exchanges or great Variety.“
“It was like a taste or protes-
sional theater — outside the ia—
miliar college context."

These were the reactions of
ltudent director Dennis Rich
and his assistant, Brenda Thom-
as, about their recent tour to
LeMoyne College, Memphis,
Tennessee, with the Grinnell
atudent theater production of
William Henley’s play “Slow
Dance on the Killing Ground."

Dave Duiiy and Bill Raiterty
(technical crew) and Carli Du-
gan and Dale Dreyluss (cast)
also went to LeMoyne for the
three—day round of periorm—
ances and discussions.

The third cast member, My-
ron Lowery, was one of tour
LeMoyne exchange students at
Grinnell last semester. (Le-
Moyne is a private, nonresiden-

tial, Negro college oi about 650
students.)

“Slow Dance” was first
staged by these Students at
Grinuell last spring while an~
ery was in attendance here.
The idea for the LeMoyne pro-
duction was conceived at that
time,

Funds Denied

Rich first tried to get: flnan—
clal backi g trorn Grinnell tor
the expedition but he was re-
fused. “We don’t have funds set
aside tor such projects,” was
the reason given by Associate
Dean Richard H. Winters. In
the past, another theater pro
duction, “The Bourgeoisie" by
Raymund Belts, history, asked
tor support to go on the road
and was also reiused for ”lack
Di funds."

After Rich was tumed down
by Grinnell, he contacted Le-
Moyne which decided to spon-
sor the tour itself.

The “Slow Dance” troupe,
accompanied by this 5&3 re-

porter, embarked on its theat-
rical experiment with an ill-
lariuus 14»hollr drive. Tem-
porarily freed from academia
pressure, animated hy anticipa-
tion of a unique experience and
reiniorced by a commonly—
shared spirit for the dramatic,
the group outdid itself with the-
atrics along the way.

After an entire day of joke-
making the cast was suiiicient»
ly "warmed up” to periorm by
the time they arrived in Mem-
phis, Tuesday night, October
25.

‘Slow Dance" was periormed
the next day in a classroom in
the Basement or the College
library. Working conditions {or
the technical crew were very
difficult because of the lack of
stage equipment. Unfortunate-
ly, LeMoyne has no drama de—
partment although one iaculty
member supervises students in
the presentation of dramatic
readings.

LeMoyne students s h ow e d

 

TWO LeMOYNE sruoams view the "Slow Dance"
marquee in front of their library, Members at the pro-
duetion agreed that the experience et taking a play on
the road was an invaluable asset to their education in
drama, All expenses were paid by LeMoyne College on
Grinpell "he: no funds allocated" tor such enterprises.

 

great interest in the production
of “Slow Dance” and the
makeshift theater was filled to
overflowing. Much of the audi-
ence stayed for discussion aiter
the performances.

LeMoyne Stirred ,
Havord Bishop, a LeMoyne
student who spent a semester
at Grinnell, said in one of the
post — periormance discussions
that this particular play was a
good choice tor LeMoyne due
to its ”pertinence to the mod
ern-day social situation."

The play is a product oi
Broadway and a sophisticated
theatrically - oriented society.
The cast ielt that the general
reaction of LeMoyne students
to the play was related to their
distance trom this society. Le.

Moyne almost totally lack:
fine arts facilities, and the Col-
lege has had little opportunity
to expose its students to drama,
including drama of a modern
social nature.

Because of this limited back-
ground in the theater the cast
said the LeMoyne audience took
the play very personally and
“hard." They indicated that
“some people walked out mes-
merized by it."

One LeMoyne professor had
opportunity to talk to a few at
his students aiter the periorm-
ances and all had been enthu-
siastic, “though they tound the
play rough." He indicated that
students reacted this way due
to “narrow religious back-
grounds,” but he added, This
exposure (to the content the
play) was good for them."

Harsh Play

“Slow Dance" does strip life
oi its amenities, for language
and action in the play are raw,
A naive, white college girl is
on her way to an abortion, yet
she blindly thinks she can help
and communicate with a bitter
and Violent Negro youth. An old
German in the play is linked
with the atrocious history of the
Nazi era.

LeMoyne students were tairly
vocal in their discussion of the
play —— freely ottering crin-
cisms. suggestions and compli-
ments, as well as interpreta-
tions oi the meaning of the
play.

Many LeMoyne students re-
marked that they miss the ac-
tivity in drama that existed
while Ned Donahoe, tnculty
member of Grinnell’s (heater
department. was in residence
at LeMoyne two years ago.

The Grinnell students (alt the
touring experience as a whole

Thomas remarked afterward,

“Touring theater forces an ac-

physical surroundings and to
audiences."

“The audience reaction tem-
pers an actor’s performance.
Different audiencﬁ stimulate
the actor to see different as-
pects or a role. Even a dull
audience is good hecause it
makes an actor really work
hard; he challenges the audi-
ence to respond by the amount
he puts into the role."

“It’s so great to be selfvdi-
rested, selfrresponsible and ma

valved in a purely artistic en-
deavor without any academic
restrictions hanging over us,"
Brenda went on to say. She also
advocated an expanded touring
program tor drama majors (in-
cluding those interested in the

might allow students to partici-
pate in more professional the

All those involved in the pro-
duction regretted that their
stay had to be limited to a few
days. Rehearsal time was inad-

chance to gain a close view at
campus life.

COPY of one of such letters from

will have the answer as to why
education for the Negro is in-
ferior in Chicago. Quote:

INNERCITY TEACHERS

Chicago, Aug. 5—The added
work load carried by the teach-
ers, clerks, and the custodial
stati in inner-city schools cer-
tainiy warrants additional com-
pens'dtion. Transfers, both in
and out. take many hours of
the day. Also. vandalism and
many problems requiring pan
ent interviews make additional
work and record keeping tor
those employed,

Generally in outlying schools
children enter the schools in
ﬁrst grade and remain until
graduation. There is little or
no damage to schools, the chil-
dren are generally well dis.
ciplined, and little or no parent
coniercnccs are required.

I have had my can seriously
damaged three different times

itiative fund to supplement their

senators concluded that it was
not the function of the Senate to

consequences of such action.
