The Minority Speaks Out Le++er From

On Tuesday, May 5th. 1970, at
a special iaculty meeting, a
majority of the faculty passed a
resolution condemning what it
termed “official repression" in
the disaster at Kent state and
linking this with the military
action in Cambodia and the
policies ot the present national
administration. The motion was
substantially the same as that
brought to the taculty by some
Students, who claimed to
represent a majority oi those
attending a meeting in South
Lounge. The number of students
was, we were told, somewhere
between 300 and 400.

Despite these figures, the
resolution claimed to represent
“the majority of the faculty and
students.” Furthermore, the
iaculty extended this claim to
represent ”Grinnell College as an
institution.”

The joint iacultystudent
resolution, then, claims to be
representative in two ways, and
both ways are, in the judgment
of the undersigned, ill founded.
But it is the second claim —- to
being representative of “Grinnell
College as an institution” 7 that
merits censure, and we are ape
‘pealing to you. the trustees, to
make that censure We argue as
follows:

1. Although the meeting was
well attended by faculty and

s:

administration, there were no
representatives of the trustees,
the parents, or the alumni.

2. The claim by one part oi
the institution to represent the
whole institution necessarily
involves those who dissent; and
such a claim is especially unfai'i
when many members of the ins
stitution had no voice at all in
the proceedings

3. The majority resolution is
highly political in nature 7 an
unprecedented and, in our view,
an improper kind oi resolution
for a college to make.

4. By suspending classes as a
part or the resolution, the iaculty
placed those who wished to
dissent in an impossible position
morally and, perhaps, legally.

5. By linking together diverse
issues, and by failing to revise
die extreme language oi the
resolution, the majority
prevented a rational conclusion
irom being reached.

We would iurther point out that
the temper oi the meeting was
highly emotional, so much so that
the majority openly violated a
long-standing tradition oi the
College; to respect the rights of
the individual conscience,

We therefore wish to dissociate
ourselves from the resolution,
and we request that the trustees
make a similar statement
available to public notice.

A symbolic Commencement was held on Central Cum-
pus May 13. Five students — Susan Fowler. Jonathan
‘Jenltins. Helen Lindblom, Arthur Searie, and Sharon

SGA President’s Statement

Because oi my role as chair
man in the various meetings that
have taken place recently I have
not been in a position to state
my views on the issues before
us. However, in my role as 5.0.
a. President i feel it my respon-
sibility to state those views,

We have reached a critical
point in our history. Decisions are
being made and will continue to
be made in the near future which
will determine what path our
nation will follow ~ self-deter-
mination or intervention abroad.
liberty or authority at home,
indeed, freedom or repression in
all our actions. These are the
Choices.

In light of these events it is
necessary now that Grinnell Col-
lege leave the ivory tower oi
academia and engage itseli in the
struggle at hand. This departure
from formal academic endeavor
will necessitate sacrifice by all
members of this institution. But
diese sacriiices pale when com.
pared with the sacrifices exacted
by our nation oi the young, the
dissident. and people oi color all
overtheworld,

For these reasons I whole-
heartedly support the Thomas
proposal.

Facul’ry Head
On Closing

To tiic President:

To summon, to order, to
elucidate the events, the factors,
the elements which led, over a
period oi iivc days, to the
decision of Grinnell College on
8 May to terminate its academic
year on 13 May, sixteen days
before its scheduled Commencer
ment, would be a lengthy and de-
manding task. Many and varied
and complex were the events, the
factors, the motives, the states
or mind which ted, or con»
ditioned, or informed the act.

But in my own Case, the con-
cern which rose, so to speak, to
the top as l approached the meet
ing of the Faculty on 8 May was
that which I there articulated:

" . , . The College cannot permit
itself as a college to be so
politicized, nor indeed appear in
the public eye to be so politicized,
that its abiding purposes are
nullified and its effective func-
tioning as a locus or tree inquiry
is precluded or impaired The
College cannot today convert
itself into a political ground, be
it a real political battleground or
a mere political playground, and
expect tomorrow to resume its
stance of disinterested Search, of
measured deliberation, of
hospitality to the widest range
of ideas alld opinions and to their
written and spoken expression.

“1 have come, over the last two
days, slowly and reluctantly to
the conclusion that circum-
stances without and within the
College, the events of the last few
days here, and the present
temper and temperature oi the
student body, as l assess them.
so seriously limit our freedom oi
maneuver and action that the
College must close its doors to
protect the very existence or its
educational house. True, in so
doing it cannot continue to fulfill
completely its contract with
students for instruction and in
quiry under conditions congenial
to instruction and learning (and
this . . . I deplore and profoundly
regret), but in not so doing, 1
fear that the College forecloses,
or may ioreclose, the possibility
oi writing any future contracts
it can pcriorm with honor and
effectiveness.

“I support the recom-
mendation of the President and
the Trustees and I urge upon the
Faculty its acceptance."

Today, 7 days later, I remain
convinced that the action of a
May was the proper one. As I
see it, the move may well have
saved the College; in any event,
it saved the chance to save the
College,

President's
Statement 1

To Parents

As you have probably heard,
either directly from your son or
daughter or indirectly through
news reports, we are closing the
College oliicially at 5-00 PM. on
Wednesday, May 13, This is two
days beiore the formal ending of
classes, as previously scheduled,
so that only the period ot iinal
examinations and com
mencement activities could have
remained. The copy of my iormal
statement to iaculty and students
on this matter is enclosed. The
faculty voted 91-4 to support it
in a separate meeting. At a
general faculty and student
assembly held Friday aiteriioon,
the student vote to support the
statement was virtually
unanimous.

The reasoning behind my
statement is essentially as
follows: No matter hoiv one may
regard the attitude oi students
both here and throughout this
nation, toward the Cambodian
affair and the Kent State in
cidcnt, it is a fact that almost
all students, irom dcctrinaire
radicals to conservatives, have
suddenly become so politically
involved that they are no longer
able to give proper concentration
to their academic studies. On this
campus, as on many others, their
attention over the past two weeks
has been almost completely
diverted into discussions and
activities about the political
crisis. In some educational in-
stitutions, as you know, this
activity has taken Violent forms.
Though there have been some
threats of such violent activity
here, it has not yet happened;
demonstrations here have been
disruptive in only a minor way.
But the important fact, as I say
in the statement I enclose. is that
the existing atmosphere and
temper make it impossible to
continue the normal and
traditional functions of the
educational institution. Aer
cordingly, I believe it is best to
close ﬂ'le school and permit
students to carry on their
political activity elsewhere than
on this campus, not under what
might be interpreted as the
authority, formal or informal, of
the College itself.

it 1 were talking here about
something less than the great
majority of Grinnell students, I
would have recommended to the
faculty and students that
alternative ways be initiated oi
approaching the problem of
completing the school year, so
that those students who wished
to complete their school year in
a regular fashion could do so. But
I think that the present en-
vironment does not allow for such
an option, rational and proper as
the case for it may appear to
those who believe the College
ought to be able to manage it.

No. IS

President's
Statement 2

To Faculty and Students

Recognizing the grave political
and educational crisis which this
nation and this college presently
face. I believe that the College
cannot continue to carry on its
llormal and traditional functions
in the next two weeks. I recognize
the desire and the need of inv
dividual members of the Come
munity to participate in non-
violent and informational
political activities, and by sus»
pending normal activity {or the
remainder of the current
academic year we allow indi-
vidual members of the come
munity to engage in such ac-
tlvitics,

After consultation with the
Chairman of the Board of
Tmstees and other members of
the Board, I am therefore recom»
mending to the Faculty that
classes be suspended for the re
mainder oi the academic year
and that the campus be officially
closed at 6:00 p.m. on Wed-
nesday, May 13.

This means that: 1) there will
be no final examination period
this year 2) there will be no
Commencement activities this
year 3) that by the period be
tween now and May 13th students
will have the opportunity to meet
with their instructors to work out
arrangements for the conclusion
of their academic responsibilities
under conditions which Dean
Wall will discuss 4) that individur
al Grinnell students will have the
opportunity to engage in
educational and informational
activities of their own choosing
until the date oi closing.

Regrettably, the College cannot
manage it without using a means
of pressure or enforcement that
it neither can use nor coun-
tenance using.

In the iive days between the
suspension of classes (that is,
from Friday, May a, through
Wednesday, May is), our major
etiorts are being directed toward
interviews with faculty and
students about academic
decisions involving individual
students. As the enclosed
statement indicates, we intend to
do everything possible to see that
equitable arrangements in.
volving all aspects of student
welfare, academic and other-
wise. are completed.

I ask for your understanding
in this time of great distress for
the College and its Con-
stituencies.

sincerely.

de raptu pauciorum

Last Friday as we returned from Newton with what
we had hoped was to be the antepenultimate issue
of the Scarlet and Black, the campus was in turmoil.
Students were flocking to the polling booths outside
the lunch lines, and the overwhelming majority was
voting to close down the school. We dutifully went
and voted for what we felt was right: preservation
of the academic status quo.

No sooner was the student referendum ended than
a faculty meeting began, during which the issue of
closing down the school was to be discussed. As the
faculty members filed into the room, they were handed
petitions for five different ways to do this by five difs
ferent factions of the faculty and students. Everyone
was apprehensive and uneasily preparing for a four-
hour debate on the details.

When President Leggett arrived to chair the
meeting, he did a very shrewd thing. He presented
a proposal to the faculty for closing the school, but
one which most of the faculty felt combined the best
features of all the other proposals. Most, indeed! The
faculty voted 91 to 4 to endorse it,

Thereupon Mr. Morris presented a resolution to
the faculty for committing itself as a body to
a particular political stance. In spite of the protest
of Mr. Ayers and Miss Noble and a few others, the
proposal passed. In other words, the minority individual
conscience was firmly and vigorously raped. But the
faculty was in a hurry to get over to Darby Gymnasium
and collect its standing ovation from the students.

Now, some seven days later, some members of the
community are having secondtﬁoughts. The procedures
which have been hastily rigged to preserve some sem-
blance of an academic commitment to the students
amidst the shambles of this semester are so compli—
cated and inadequate that even those who wanted to
close the school are grumbling among themselves. A
very dangerous precedent has been set that will
ultimately remove all need for argument when
questions such as credit-fail in requirements and majors
come up, when students want to close down the school
in the fall for elections, when the majority wants to
subscribe the name of the college to a political
movement.

Earlier this year, in a report to the faculty by Mrs.
Helena Ponseti, Spanish, on the Midwest Fulbright Con-
ference on Higher Education held at the University
of Iowa, June 1969, these words were spoken: “Institu-
tionsof higher learning operated under several conflict-
ing guiding principles cannot survive. It is not so much

any more ‘a house divided cannot stand’ as ‘an institu-
tion without clear goals cannot exist’." No one listenedi

The eilitors would like to express their gratitude to all those who
have helped with the paper, this semester and a special vote oi thanks
goes to Proiessor n. o. Apostle, who shared with us his invcsllg
into the nature oi a liberal education, something dear to us all.

Letters to the Editors

To the Editor:

It is an observation
common to mankind that
those who try to do what they

have not done for along time do it
ill So it was with the faculty on
May 5th in its attempt to be
moral, One can perhaps
lneasure the current stresses on
mind and body and soul by obs
serving that the iaculty was
driven, for the first time in my
seven years at the College, to
adopt a moral position. In fact,
Dean Wall informs me that the
faculty has not done such a thing
since 1942.

Mr Klausner, doyen of the
philosophy department, maniully
tried to rescue the iaculty from
its violation of tradition and res»
pect for individual conscience; he
moved to Strike the word
“morality” irom the preamble to
the resolution which was ulti~
matcly passed, The preamble
stated that Grinnell College was
devoted to “reason and moral~
lty,” Mr. Klausner’s motion als
most passed, since there was
general agreement that the
faculty had no idea of what mors
allty was. But hotter heads pres
valled and the word “morality”
was kept on pragmatic grounds. 1
was unable to get the floor to
move that the word “reason"
was, in the context, as suspect as
the word “morality."

Let it be on the record that the
iacully took a hastily drawn-up
and badlysworded resolution
from a minority of the students
lsome fraction of 374 hundred
students out of a total of over
two, approved that resolution as
rcpi-csenting a majority or the
students and faculty, and then
Claimed to represent “Grinnell
College as an institution ” The
faculty's action was probably
illegal and certainly immoral. In
suspending classes as a part of
the motion, the laculty violated
its own commitment to education

and demanded that every indivir
dual faculty member comply
with its wrong action.

Ipoint with humble pride to the
fact that I have viewed with
alarm the steady tendency oi the
faculty to move in this direction.
In the past few years we have
seen a shift or power in the
faculty away irom the
old-line liberals who sure
vived the Stevens’ crisis and
over to a group of young instruc-
lors _ dedicated and aggressive
7 who represent what is called
“the new left." After a couple of
years or jockeying, the old»line
liberals have surrendered to the
new left. The illcoalesced coalis
lion is backed, of course, by a
sizable minority ol students;
their combined intentions and
efforts are aimed at (in their bar-
barous jargon) “politicizing” the
College, Tuesday’s meeting was
the first successful step in
“politiclzation.”

“Folilicizalion” CDnSlstS 01' the
lollowing premises: all actions
are political; no individual or me
stitution can avoid being politir
cal; therefore no individual or in-
stitution should try to avoid being
political, and if either does so try,
it should be lorced into taking
sides.

Those of us who read the an-
cient classics 7 which, as
Fielding says, “steel and harden
lhe mind against the capricious
invasions of fortune — remember
our rhucydid‘es- as long as
human nature remains the Same,
Thucydldes’ history will prove
relevant, We are beginning to see
icon-acted the process of revolu-
tion which took place at Corcyra,
one state of which was what the
“new left” calls "politicizalion,"
that is, creating factions so ops
posed that no middle ground is
lcii for sanity, reason, or moral-
ity Those who attempt to occupy
(his middle ground will find that
their golden mean is steeped in
their own blood, as extremists

from either side destroy them.

in the student takeover of the
AFROTC building we observed
the first real violence on orinnell
campus. That violence is sane
tioned by the faculty‘s resolution,
which does not condemn student
violence but only what it calls
“official repression.” in the sad
iigure oi Mr, Ayers, who was in
timidated into leaving his apart-
lnent (at lhe hack'oi the AFROTC

The Nature of a Liberal Education: A Definition

By H. o. Apostle

Let us now summarize the
results oi the preceding Parts
and discuss some items related
loaliberal education asawhole.

Man, it was statcd, is a com-
plex being with a variety oi
needs; hence he is capable of
a variety of pleasures. But the
fulfillment of just one or a few
kinds of needs, and so of
pleasures, is not sufficicnt for a
life of richness, and such lack
of suiiicieiicy also brings pains,
Hence a learner should become
aware oi a variety oi interests
and should acquire the
corresponding iiabits. Acr
cordiiigly, two things are
necessary knowledge and art
according to knowledge in a
variety of fields. The exercise of
knowledge alone can yield only
pleasures of the mind; that at
art according to knowledge can
yield pleasures also of action, for
many human activities and
disciplines (politics, medicine,
etc) require both kinds; and the
two kinds are not adequately
fulfilled without health. Of
course, one cannot afford to
become interested in all
disciplines, and so there must be
a selection, But one selects from
what he knows there is to select,
and the greater the number of
things to select irom, the better
the selection. The kind of
education called “liberal,” then,
is desngned (a) to make the
student aware of what there is
to select and (b) to develop in
him the proper habits, in
tellectual, artistic, and ethical,
which make happiness probable
(happiness being a sort of harr
mony ot pleasures and avoidance
oi pains), for pleasures irom
improper habits bring also pains,
like‘the pains which follow the
pleasures oi heroin, and the
result is discord and unhap-
piness. Now there are pleasures
of the mind and pleasures of the
senses; and under a developed
mind are included a career, a
good intellect in a general sense,
and the appreciation oi the arts,
while under a developed
character come a variety of

pleasures. including those of the
senses. The definition of a
liberally educated person,
therefore, iollows irom what has
been said,

DEFINITION: A liberally
educated person is one who has
acquired suiiicicntly (l) a
developed mind, which includes
la) a good intellect in a general
way, (1)) ii sense oi appreciation
ior the arts, and to) good training
fora career; (2) a good charactcr
through the required knowledge
and lhe exercise of the
corresponding proper habits; and
t3) knowledge and the
corresponding habits necessary
to maintain and promote a
healthy body, all oi these ior the
sake of a continuous life of
happiness.

Under “a developed mind” we
include coiirscs on the following
topics- the history of our present
civilization, methodology lthe
nature of a science and an arlli
a natural science (mathematics
or physics or chemistry or
biology) treated in a general or
in a technical manner, and a
social science Under “the ap-
preciation of arts” we include one
or two courses from various
helds (music, painting, English
or toreign literature, sculpture,
etc ) Under “development of
character” we include a
discussion course in ethics; and
under ”health," physical
education and a course on health.
These courses should constitute
the minimum requirement, ior
various careers require ad-
ditional courses, which should be
the concern of the individual
departments.

Most required courses should
be taken in the iirst two years,
but there should be some
flexibility. The course of
methodology should be given in
the junior or senior year, for
some preparation in the sciences
and the arts is advisable, and
some maturity is required to
understand the abstract concepts
common to the sciences and the
arts. A career, we stated, is oi
major importance, so the
preparation of it should not be

delayed by overburdening the
student with requirements in his
first two years ii the student has
already decided on a career.
Creativity and discovery in the
special helds are best developed
in early years, and specialization
in the various fields suggests an
early start, so if the student's
interest has already been
aroused in a given field, it should
not bchandicapped at the start

Concerning that part oi the
development of the mind and of
character which has to do with
art in certain human affairs
(responsibility, government,
dccision~making in practical af-
iairs in general), it should cerr
iaiiily be promoted, especially in
those students whose careers
require much action. But by
definition a student is a learner
and does not have the knowlcdge
and the maturity to make ader
quatc decisions concerning the
larger issues, such as those air
iccting the general interests oi
the state or of the nation or of
the world, or even oi tiic college
But ior tiic sake oi learning,
students should be allowed and
encouraged to make decisions on
lcsscr issues, where any harm
that may come will not be
signiiicant, as in running their
own aiiairs in the dormitories,
provided that such decisions do
not run contrary to the basic
rights of all students, But to allow
students to participate in decis-
ions on iaculty tenure, iaculty
promotions, admissions policy,
selection or a president, and other
matters which affect the general
interest oi the college, would be
unwise indeed, for this runs
contrary to the very idea that
students are still learners. They
may discuss such issues among
themselves and with the faculty
and the administration, and they
may make suggestions; in fact,
such discussions and suggestions
should be encouraged,

Since part oi the means oi
happiness is the formation oi the
proper habits, both adminis»
trators and faculty should see to
it that this part is neither violated
nor neglected. Flagrant violation
of college rules by students leads
to similar violations of the laws
of the land when such students
leave the college community.
Now just as bad laws are better
than no laws at all, so bad rules
are better than no rules at all;
and, as stated earlier, students
should be free to make their
thoughts and wishes known to the
administration, if they consider
certain. rules bad. But willful
violation and confrontation
should never be allowed, for this
leads to lack of respect,
disregard of reason and ex-
perience, and the substitution of
emotion as a means. All these
defeat the way of learning and
the purpose oi a liberal education
as usually understood and as
defined here.

The argument that violence
(we may also include vandalism,
building takeover, deliberate
interference in education, etc.)
on or oil campus by students is
nowadays justified because it
forces educational or political
authorities to change existing ills
is grossly misa’pplied. Some ills
do exist, always existed, and will
always exist, and an ideal society

to correct existing ills must al-
ways be welcome. But students
in our nation today never had it
so good for many reasons: they
are financially well off, they are
given the opportunity to study,
they are given the freedom of
choice, their future is well
assured, and their professors and
administrators are not authori-
tarians. Comparison with
students in other nations should
Convince anyone of our
educational superiority in these
respects, Again, the students'
aim should be education, not the
prevention of it by violence; and
the presumption by some of them
to superior knowledge in
morality, politics, and other such
great issues is ridiculous. Fur»
lher, such students tend to defeat
the very independence of educa
tion ii-om political interierence;
for if students have the right to
interfere with national
authorities through violence,
politicians have a similar right
to interfere with the students'
education, and the victor will not
be the students. So let politicians
take care oi politics, and
educators (not students) take
care of education. students’ right
to act politically through uieir
elected representatives has
never been denied, and individ-
ually they are free to protest and
parade peaceiully without pre
venting education. As for change,
the most probable change
through a period of violence or
chaos is not reform but dicta-
torial takeover, like that by the
army in Greece in 1967 ‘ a bad
alternative. Finally, it is only a
small minority of students who
advocate and resort to violence;
and they do so at the expense
of the majority

It's a sad commentary on those
administrators who, in the name
of "tolerance” or some other
such misconception, allow the
irresponsible actions at an im-
mature, determined, revolu-
tionary, arrogant, and misguided
minority to interiere with the
education oi a good and serious
mayor-ity As already stated in a
previous Part. the serious
violations nowadays differ in

kind, not in degree; hence, they
require a treatment which like
wise differs in kind, not in degree,
For a student who errs and ad;
mits his action as an error. the
penalty should be one oi
correction, But for a student who
openly deiies the rules or resorts
to violence, the answer is not a
penalty oi correction but sev-
erance from the college, The
effort to try to change the mind
of such a student (and the
corrective returns are negligible)
can better be used for better
purposes elsewhere; and the
damage by penalizing him lightly
results in encouraging others to
do likewise, Such penalty, we
may add, should apply especially
lo pi-oiessors, whose character
and ideas are less subject to
change, it they advocate
violence. Recent over-leniency
has failed, and expectation oi a
cure is based on shaky principles.
Prevention would have been
better.

Ultimately, the responsibility
rests with the Trustees, ior
ultimale direction of the lack of
it issues from them; and it is
a grave responsibility, ior higher
learning is a national respon-
sibility. not limited to Just the
college in which it is imparted.
Perhaps some change in the
distribution of power is needed
in many colleges, and perhaps
authority should be assigned to
persons who are both responsible
and knowledgeable in the field
where authority is exercised.
Authority to impose penalties ior
violation oi college rules, for
cxample, dos not belong to stu-
dents, and an authoritative body
which includes them (like our
Judicial Council; mree students,
three professors) is likely to lead
to ineiiiciency, ineiiectivencss,
irustration, and even injustice.
The recent events at the Univer-
sity or Northern iowa illustrates
the point, and President Maucker
in his recent TV talk discussed
the importance oi the principle
ofknowledgeability.

In general, the relation oi

students is that of the complete
to the incomplete, not oi equals
to equals. A father does not take
a vote in a family, a doctor does
not vote with the nurses, and the
directors do not vote with the
employees on the advisability of
building a new plant. in educa~
tion, where knowledge is one aim,
knowledge should be the guiding
principle even more so, and if
this is abandoned, other prin-
ciples will take its place, such
as oratory, emotion, politics,
violence, etc., and then there will
be only a semblance of knowl-
edge. The argument that
sometimes students‘are right and
administrators wrong does -not
disturb the relation between the
rule and the exception; for
doctors too are sometimes
wrong, but is is still they who
should make medical decisions
and not the nurses, who are more
numerous.

today should be thinking more

can doubt that Grinnell students

Are Grinnell Students capable
of affirmation? Could we have
said that we will continue classes
to honor those who died? That
we will continue classes because
we believe that education alone,
not just the education of the
classroom but also die education
of exposure 0t many ideas and
worlds, produca that tolerance
which we hope will lead to
brotherhood? Could we honor
their lives above their deaths?
If we must sacrifice to show our
sympathy for what the Kent State
students sacrificed, and what the
soldiers in Indochina sacrifice,
why must we always sacrifice
our classes? Why not the time
outside of our classes? Is our
time spent in private pursuits of
pleasure and education unworthy
of sacrifice, or is it too important
for it?

Will it be more impressive to
the world. to Iowa, to the friends
and families of those who are
sacrificed, that we can organize
pickets and protests? 1 think we
would be saying and meaning far
much more if we held a service
— a communion in which both
liberal and conservative could
participate 7 to stand for life,
for peace, for liberation, rather
than against death, against war,
and against repression! l

Women performed better
academically during the first
semester than men of
coeducation at Yale University.

A breakdown of grades at four
levels revealed: “Honors"
women 27.5 per cent, men 23,9 per
cent; “high pass” e women 46
per cent, men 39.6 per cent;
”pass" a women 18.6 per cent,
men 23.4 per cent; "fail” —
women 0.9 per cent, men 1.4 per
Cent.

The percentages represented
the grades of 3,254 men and 566
women at the university.

for the college atmosphere for
proper habits was strong enough
to discourage improper habits
But that atmosphere is dis
appearing now, and there is
nothing left to replace it, except
“personal conscience," a polite
term for individual caprice,
which is nothing more than a set
of contradictory thoughts and
actions. What is needed today.
then, is the reinstatement of
proper conduct through the
awareness of the principles
which justify that conduct; for
to change just the habits is
neither easy nor intellectually
convincing.

Finally, although divergence of
opinion should be allowed, it does
not follow that every opinion
which is different should be given
an equal hearing. There are also
opinions which are obviously bad
or obviously harmful or obviously
destructive, and to honor them
as if they were equal alternatives
or equally controversial is
ridiculous and unwise. If men
with different opinions have truth
as their aim, they should be like
friends trying to determine which
of the opinions are true; so there

the terms “Controversial" and
”divergence of opinion.” So since
the pursuit of important truths
is good, and this is one of the
aims of a liberal education,
administrators and faculty and
students should be like friends
trying to discover and impart
that which is true. Friendship,
even more than justice, is a basis
in any community which is
formed for the sake of some good.
As Aristotle says, ”friendship
seems to hold a state together,
and lawgivers care more for
friendship than for Justice; for

when men are friends,
justice is not wanting, but when
they are just, they still need
friendship, and the action which
is most just is considered to be
the one which is done in a friendly
man." If so, then, friendship is
even more important in an
educational community, for here
truth and goodness and beauty
are pursued to the highest
degree. The lack of this quality
in the educational institutions of
a nation is a strong sign of a
grave failure, for if thﬁe institu-
tions cannot promote this quality,
no others can, and the whole
lation suffers.

To The Editors:

An educational institution is not
a political institution. Colleges
should not be used or dominated

by political purposes and goals.
The resolutions passed by the
faculty on May 5 and May 8 were
morally unjust in their Violation
of individual and academic
rights. My direct plea, made in
the name of individual freedom,
that the May 8 resolution be
circulated as a petition which
faculty members could sign if
they so desired, Was ignored. 1
deplore this spirit of intolerance
which violated the tenets of
academic and personal freedom
by insisting that many voices be
heard as one voice. When a
majority so deliberately forces
its will on a minority the very
existence of freedom is

threatened

To The Editors:

On Monday morning, May 4th,
an etching by David Petta was
stolen from the Student Show in
the Fine Arts Center. It seems
likely that the thief was a Grin-
nell College Student, so I direct
my remarks to this community.

For a number of reasons, Ifind
this particular kind of theft
thoroughly revolting. implicit in
the theft isan' appreciation for
the product of a fellow students
labor which, far from being a
subtle form of ﬂattery, smacks
of a total disregard for the stu~
dent Whose work it is. This thief
is a parasite who sets himself
so far, above his fellow students
that he feels it his right to appro-
priate their labor for himself and
his action strike at the root of
mutual trust upon which this
community must rely for its con
tinued openness.

I ask him to Consider the
destructiveness of his theft, and
to the college community at
large, I suggest that the
protection of such a thief is self
destructive.

Open Letter;

Tonight I am sick with the
events of this day. Isee this insti-
tution as a number of people,
some who have acted in good
faith for a cause in which they
believe. But I see many others,
students and faculty alike, who,
through the emotional intensity
of the moment, have been co~
opted into a movement and an
action which will destroy this
school.

It’s all in your priorities, you
say, and 1 agree. But my priori
tiesare different. Anyone who
really knows who I am knows
that I favor the political views
of the people who want this
place closed. But I
have watched these people
take both the student body
and the Iacultyof this college and
herd them like sheep into an
action that sets a very dangerous
precedent for future activities on
the campus. What are you going
to do the next time something
like Kent or Cambodia happens?
Where are you going to draw the
line the next time?

What really hurts is to see how
so many people, who normally
offer lots of debate to any propos-
al on this campus, can accept
with so little question a badly
thoughtout, radical proposal,
perpetrated by a radically re-
pressive campus. Who is going
to answer to my friends who are
seniors, who will miss the cul-
mination of their college
careers? Who will answer to my
friends who came to mis place
to learn to think? Who will an-
swer to people who don’t know
what they are going to do with
the sudden burden of three empty
weeks, some who have no place
to live until June, many who must
try to resettle without the benefit
of much»necde'd student employ-
ment checks for the month of
May? Who will answer to the
students who see the action as
irrelevant to die larger issues
that face our nation, yet must
explain to their parents what is
happening here'! But most im-
portant, who will answer to the

To the Editors:

Throughout this century we
have been waging a war as costly
as any World War. Yet the battles
are not taking place in the jungles
of Vietnam or on the hills of
Korea but on America's own soil.
It is the Americans struggle
against America. We are witness»
ing the Second American Revo-
lution. This belief is no longer
me rhetoric of a radical few: the
violence in American cities, the
suppression of free voices every-
where, and me deaths at Kent
State and across the nation all
attest to an imminent revolution.

America has progressed past
the point where protest can be
a playful pastime: our individual
rights and very lives are in
jeopardy now. Sending delegates
to Washington and Des Moines
and placing advertisements in
die New York Times are noble
gestures, “But when moral

ADDRESS:

gestures, however emotionally
satisfying, become mere sub~
stitutes for effective policies, or
when they might even help to
worsen a particular situation,
they are robbed of moral
validity.” (Colin Legum, London
Observer, on the Nigeria Civil
War.)

What purposeful measures can
we take out in Iowa? In light of
die tragedy at Kent State, we
could take steps to prevent such
a confrontation from becoming
catastrophic here. The time and
money put towards preparing
students to protect themselves
would be well spent, Firstraid
against mace, gunshou, or simi»
lar hazards and rudimentary
self-defense methods are good
things for all of us to have at
our disposal. The past has shown
that these measures would have
been beneficial; the future will
show whether more drastic pre-
cautions are necasary.
