Leggeil Seeks Campus Plan.
Asks Siudenl Poriicipdiion

By HAROLD FUSON

President Glenn Leggett this
week sketched the broad out-
lines of a planning program
which he hopes will “tell us
where we want to be as a col»
lege ten or twelve years from
now." In an interview with this
reporter. President. Leggett dis-
cussed several proposals which
he will present to the faculty in
the Coming weeks in an effort to
implement this planning.

The general organization of
the program will be based
around a set of three commit-
tees: a central steering commit-
tee and two subordinate com-
mittees, one on educational pol-
icy and one on physical plan-
ning and landscape. The latter
committee Leggett suggested
would be divided into subcom~
mittees dealing with particular
areas such as landscape, resia
dence hall development and
physical education iacilities.

_ Details to Come

The details of the commit-tee
organization are yet to be
settled and the whole program

. insofar as it touches upon aca<
demic policy is still subject to
iaculty approval. Leggett hopes,
however, to have the program
firmly on the road within a law
weeks.

Leggett said he felt that the
committees must be so organ-
ized as to allow “Wide active
participation in discussions” and
at the same time provide a
means for “coming to focus”
and oriering actionable alterna-
lives. The aim according to
Leggett is to avoid “splendid
rhetoric" and instead arrive by

Participation stressed

Leggett expressed concern for
obtaining student participation
in the work or the planning com.
mittees. He has been consulting
with SGA President Steve Kent
and other student leaders as to
the best means of bringing
about this participation. Stu-
dents will likely be asked to sit
on the committees and certainly
to utter advice in particular
areas.

Leggett said there is a possi-
bility that he and iaculty and
man Wall might ask to gnrbea
tore the Senate in a row weeks
to more fully discuss his pro-
porals.

Lauterbacii Discusses 'AWS Proposals

By ANN KIRSCHNER

“Prioriiy Will be given in dis-
cussions this year to is consid-
eration of Women's hours, but
we are equally concerned with
other campus problems," said
Karen Lanterbach, president or
AWS Board, at a recent inter-
view,

- Although a good deal at time

 

C Oming E ncampment

Seeks Philosophy

Forty students and twenty
faculty members will attend the
1966 Encampment Sept. 3!) to
October 2 at Boone. All are be«
ing chosen by the Encampment
Committee from among inter-
ested applicants. in addition,
P re 5 id e nt Leggett, Deans
Stauss, Winters, Thompson and
Low, and Mr. Wall, chairman
oi the Faculty, will attend all or
part of the session. Robert
Noyce, Chairman or the Board
of Tlustees, and several mem-
bers of the Board of Trustees
are expected to attend part of
the session.

The Encampment Committee

has announced that this year's.

encampment will be organized
to steer attention away from
specitic problems to get at the
basic philosophy and purpose oi
the college.

"Back to Campus"

Kathy Jagow, chairman oi the
committee, stressed in an 5&8
interview that one or the major
concerns of this year's encampa
ment will be how to “get it back
into campus.” Miss Jagow
hopes that the ideas and spirit
generated at Boone can be car-
ried home to all students and
faculty.

In line with this aim, Miss
Jegow outlined a number of
steps which the encampment
committee hopes to take after
the encampment. The usual
summary report will again be
distributed to the entire commu<
nity through the campus mail.
in addition, panel discussions
will be held and perhaps a
series of hall meetings will deal
with encampment r e p o r t 5.
There is also the possibility that
the encampment discussion
groups might continue meeting
after encampment to lurther de-
velop the ideas discussed at
Boone.

Six Amos

Discussion at Boone will be
organized in these six general
areas:

1. Grinnell presented to the
outside world —- public rela-
tions, fund-raising. alumni ab
tails. The availability of inter.

. motion about administration and

student activities both on and
oif campus.

2. The student “personality"
— What is the Grinnell student?
The role of admissions in de»
termining the type at students
attending Grinnell.

3. Academic demands and
goals of both students and fac-
ulty at Grinnell. A critical look
at curriculum and classroom,

4. The obligations of the col-
lege in regulation and restric-
tion. The right of different
groups at Grinnell to participate
in basic decision making.

5, The relations or the college
to the outside world — oil cam-
pus programs, political activi-
ties, social protest groups and
so on. Should there be more oi
this? The advantages and prob-
lems or Iowa isolation.

6. The responsibility oi, the
college to society in general.
Do we have a public service ob-
ligation to iuliill? The goals of
higher education and the suc-
cess oi the liberal arts college
in meeting them.

will be spent in getting women’s
opinions on hours, Miss Lauter-
bach leels that the board should
represent istudent concerns in
areas other than rules, particu:
larly those oi academic and so
cial matters. A specriic project
of the Board is to have New Stu-
dent Days group leaders extend
their. activities beyond the first
week oi school to act as liasons

between the ireshmenand their»

faculty advisers. in this way.
students could be made to feel
more comiortable talking to
members oi the iaculty and ad
visors could be potential coun-
seling assistants. The battle-
boards would share the respon-
sibility of being aware or the
problems of all students, not
just freshmen.

the Board, has now gone into

Bucks Says Senate Nol Game;
Rules Amended Al First Session

By ALAN AXELROD

The ’66-'67 Senate season is
under Way, and it Wednesday
night's opening meeting is any
indication, the year should be
a fruitiul one.

in its iii-st legislative action
of the year, the Senate unani-
mously passed a motion to ex-
tend the hours oi coeducational
visitation in the hall lounges.
Hencelortll, the lounges in the
men's halls will be open coedu-
cationally from 9 am. until
women’s hours, and the lounges
in the women's halls will be
open trom 9 am. until loggia
closing hours.

Coll-l? President Bob Foot.
explained that the halls may rs-
strict their lounge hours ll they
so desire. The new plan will he
submitted for approval to the
Faculty Committee on Student

Altair-s, alter which it will no

on to President Leggett and the
trustees.

Speaker Dan Bucks, in com-
menting on the speaker's role in
the Senate, said his primary
aim is ”seeing that the Senate
achieves the goals it sets ior it-
sell."

“1 Will be highly intolerant of
petty politics. We have too
many purposes to achieve to get
bogged down with the sort of
inciiiciency that has plagued the
Senate in the past."

In zeierenco to last year’s
controversy over the worth at
the Senate, Bucks said. "i don't
conceive oi the Senate on a
game." He went on to say that
the Senate can realistically
serve to inspire and motivate
the campus.

to be given as a guest perform-
ance at Cornell College in Feb-
ruary.

Max Heltgott Will direct the

Richard Meyer, theatre direc-
tor, will direct the major pro
ductions during the year. They
include Brecht’s “Mother Cour-
age,” Miller's “After the Fall,”
and Moliere’s “Termite."

New to the theatre depart-
ment this year is Thomas Som-
erville, technical director for
Roberts Theatre.

Somervilie, a graduate or
Grinnell, received his MA. in

Rules Changes

In the short months of its exis—
tence the new AWS Board has made
lome notable strides toward bring-
Ing a degree of reality to the an-
cient code of rules which protect
and smother Grinnell womanhood.
The recent Quad dress rule change
and the new grace minutes program
pro certainly constructive steps in
the right direction. But they are on-
ly short steps, and there is much
which must yet be done before
rules will reflect reality.

It seems, however, that some-
thing else must come before the
rules themselves can be changed.
Further rule changes, if they are
to be of any value, must be major
ones, so major that they require
a new and more vital conception
of what Grinnell is and ought to be.
In short, Grinnell life must begin
to reflect the kind of maturity

which the rule changes will re-
quire.

To a large degree this maturity
is already present. What it requires
is simply a good public relations
effort to bring it into focus and a
good theoretical study to provide
in writing the rationale which al-
ready exists in mind and action for
many of us. But while maturity is
evident there are still too many
pockets of irresponsibility on both
campuses. There is still too much
of what one administration official
has called the "damn foolishness”
of prepping, There is still too much
condoning of objectionable drunk-
oneas and obscenity.

It is up to those who claim ma-
lurity to see that such symptoms of
childishness are curbed. When this
is done the rules situation can more
easily be liberalized.

I Am A Prisoner 0f Saga

Edit. note: The following plea was
discovered by an intrepid 5&3 cub re-
pnrler in his cake at lunch Tuesday.
it is here reprinled in the public iu<
terest.

Woe is mel

My story -— unbelievable as it may
seem —- must reach the outside world
somehow. Others must not he entrapped
into my heinous predicament of terror.
And you. dear reader. may even be able
to reform the editing horror before my
time is gone.

I am a sophomore at Grlmell; that is
to say, I would have been a whoa-om
lhlsyeuillhadmendedmydlsses
inst yen. But I couldn‘t go In class; I
had no time.

I had no time to lure girls into my
room. . .

I had no time in take my swimming
test. . . .

I had no time to polish the eagle. . . .

i had no time to wait for the Cafe dei
Faro to really open for business. . .

I hardly had time to eat the food I am
omnipresently supposed to cook. . . .

It all started when I was a small child.
I was reared on Horatio Alger books.
They told me to make snmcihlng of my-
self, to he industrious, to eam my own
way. My parents lolcl me to make some-
thing of myself, in be industrious, and to
earn my own way through school. FinaI<
ly, when the financial aid office told me
to make something of myself, in be in-
dustrious, and in earn my way through
college, I decided to make something of
myself, to be industrious, and to earn my
way through Grlunell.

Yet little did I realize the Scylleharb-
dian choice that my decision to put my-
self through school represented. it was
only after already signing my contract
with Saga that I discovered the mini-

mum wage on campus to be only eighty-
eight (83!) cents. It was then that I first
realized to my extreme dismay that to
finance my Grinnell education, I would
have to work 3,000 hours each of my
academic years at the college.

My first year at Grimell, I was on
campus 210 days. In order to finance my
31800 tuition, food, etc. in addition to m ,
travel expenses, nooks, and clothes,
found myself Working in Comes all hours
a dayl l was allowed to sleep four
hours a day (except at Christmas when
I found it Wary to Iork additional
hours to purchase presents).

I had no time for anyming else. . . .

1 must digress tor a moment to say
that one day — when ﬁzwles was closed
for its traditional onceevery-threeyeal
cleaning — I was able to visit my first
classes here. It was in February, I think.
about the time the debate club kids were
heading South for Mardi Gzas. I sat in
on Economics 217; there I learned that
the minimum wage in the United States
was approaching $1.60. I remember won<
dering why our campus was no longer
considered a part of the United States.

Later I attended History 226. There I
learned that the Southerners had coun-
tered Abolitionist propaganda during the
Civil War by implying that Northern
workers were veritable wage slaves. I
remember wondering if maybe the
Southerners were right sometimes. It
might be added that i‘m not wondering
any more.

Such is my tale of woe. I write it while
locked in the Cowles kitchen for my four.
hour night. Somehow I will try to
smuggle ‘ out to the world of the free
and the livlng. i need help, and my fel-
low sufferers in the Quad, the Library
and the Desk in the Forum Lobby must

previous issues of the 5&3 re-
ﬂected the concern of the edi-
tors for glvlng due publicny to
areas in which Grlnnell students
are actively conoerned with the
problems of contemporary so-
ciety.

The editors saw the Des
Moines project as an honest at-
tempt by a relatively large
group nf Grinnell students (at
least fifty at one point) acling
on their own initiative to coin-
bat the problems of poverty in
Des Muluea Last week's riot by
some 390 Negro teenageis in
Des Moines certainly seems to
substantiate the opinion that
the problems were and are very
real ones.

No attempt was ever made n
the part of the project puri
pants Io hide information about
the project (several coffee hours
were held at which students
were invited to ask questions).
The son was certainly uni con-
cerned wllh hiding information.
The particular questions which
Miss Hughes and Miss Baker
ask about the end or the project
were largely answered in the
April 15, I966 issue of the 58:3.
The 5823 was aware of Mr.
King’s background as an 5135
organizer in Newark, New Jer-
sey, before he came to Des
Moines. The 5&3 was also
aware of and reported on Mr.
King’s plans to return to New
York last spring [0 lake up com-
munity service work there.

The 5&1! will continue to ful-
ﬁll its responsibility to report
events related to the student
body.

To the Editnrl

The “Invalid Generalizations"
column by PRJ in the last sea
issue was aptly entitled. Fresha
men may indeed be uneducat-
cd, but certainly no more so,
proportionately, than the upper-
classmen who surround ibem.

As a freshman, I find myself
in the unlnlellectual position of
beginning a liberal education
alier leaving a iall'ly unllberzll
high school The seuiurs around
me do not seem to be loo lib-
erally endowed Wltlt anything
more inlelleciual than pride in
their own potency.

The fact that ihe pic-1970
classes were very probably
characterized by bearded girls
and frustrated boys m as op-
posed to file bearded boys and
iweniyfoul- year old girls la-
beled by PRJ as members of
my class —— does not seem an
issue to merit so mllch resent-
merit. What makes PR1 think
that college mores will change
so much in the next four years
after remaining lalrly constant,
although not so laudy, for the
past thirty?

The North Campus problem
was here before we arrived, and
the Cowles prepping that went
on last Sunday at 4 a.m., and
other incidents of last weekend
(such as the breaking of East
Norris‘ Window) seem to indi-
cate upperclassmen really don‘t
give much of a damn what sort
of reputation the college re-
ceives.

The class of 1970 may well
end up living in a yellow sub-
marine, but upperclassmen —

if what I’ve seen is any ex-
ample~are already submerged
in their own pride and resent-
ment. — Frustrated Fmsh.

Ed. Note: The foﬂowing is
a letter to the editor found in

a recent issue of the Gal95«
burg all.) Register Mail un-
der the headline "Tail Wags
Dogs”.

To the Editor:

R e c e n t student demonstraa
tions around the country, and
resolutions by siudcm associa-
tions, are demanding that the
law concerning the use of cera
tain drugs and the Selective
Service system be changed.
This leaves me wondering Why
the students think they have
any right whatsoever to demand
that any law be Changed. . .

A sludeni is on the receiving
end all the way, until he, or
she, graduates. The parents, the
tax supported government agenn
cies, ihose who provide scholar-
ships, all give the studem an
opportunity to learn. . . .

Why then do students feel
they can demand what form or
shape (his gift of an education
should be? By their demands,
they are in effect saying to
their parents, and to all who
make their schoollng possible:

facilities for me. You must not
object to any way I talk, dress

The annual tall meeting of the
presidents of the Associated

was highlighted by a discussion
oi admissions procedures where
cooperative action would bene-
fit the member colleges,

Grinnell President Glenn Leg-
gett said that proposals are un-

allow a student to file a single
application and pay a single tea
to receive consideration by two
or more of the ACM schools of
his choice,

“We're all worried about the
problem of multiple applica-
tions." Leggett said. It is hoped
that common admissions policy
might relieve the applicant’s ex-
pense and time spent in apply-
ing to several schools. At the
same time it would relieve the
schools' expenses in processing
the applicatio . By asking the
applicant to indicate his preter-

gain a better picture or the

Social Workers Counter Apathy

By ANNE FARRER

Besides performing t h o s 5
functions expected or them as
members of the Grinnell com.
munity, i.e., attending classes,
digesting SAGA iood. etc,. many
students make time, or con-
structively utilize their academ-
tc apathy, in various on or on
campus activities. Depending
upon the direction one wishes
his existential development to
take, one may become a dark
spirit in the drama department,
expound tor SGA or go on aca-
demic pro in the publications
room. However, for those who
have a tinge or social work in-

big white bird":

even live it yourself. Form your

one torm them tor you.

Such was the message and
main theme of Presldent Mll-
lard Roberts’ annual Summer
Convocation Address delivered
to an almost capacity crowd in
the Fry-Thomas Fieldhouse last
Wednesday morning.

Students Needed

Speaking or what’s doing at
Uncle Sam's Club, more would
be if more college students
would participate. At present
there is a severe dearth of
Eagle Scouts, With which a
much needed troop could be or-
ganized, and with an increasing
interest on the part of the Grin-
nell jack and lie-man faction,
more tresh air and sportsman-
ship could be imbued in various
young male members. And any—
one \‘vho has musical capability,
not necessarily talent, will he

with a passion for linger paint-

detines it, anyone who can be

tact either Bev Korstad, Kaye
Handiord, Eill Shaui or Tom

vehicle to get the above point
across, Dr. Roberts also
stressed the fact that Parsons
is approaching the American

dream oi providing an educa-
tion for anyone who wants one,

Following the invocation giv-
en hy Campus Minister, Jack R.
Steele, [he “Chorale,” led by
Director Grier Davis, sang "Old
Man River,” highlighted with a
solo by sophomore Roger Behr.

Vice President for Academic
Affairs Wiillam E. Munson then
introduced Dr. Roberts as a
man of many accomplishments.
Alter receiving a standing ova-
tion. President Roberts de-
scribed Parsons, its faculty and
its students,

He spoke or the school's aims
and purposes with the assuring
news that the college was
achieving most of them. Along

with the main theme of “form< .

lng your Own opinions." Presi-
dent Roberts also discussed
many or the problems or educa-
tion and how Io overcome them
—specitlcally how Parsons over-
came and is still solving many
oi them.

At the conclusion of the ad—
dress both faculty and students
responsively sang the Alma.
Mater and then. as the iacuity
ﬂied cut, the student body
waited respectlully until the
hand ﬁnished "Fanfare and RE-

Mononucleosis Danger to Students;
Nurse Explains Causes, Prevention

A health' problem often asso—
ciated with the fast pace 0! stu-
dent. life is the disease called
infectious mononucleosis: Mrs.
Irma Hall, Administrative Su-
pervisor ot the College Health
Center, says that students who
are exposed to “mono” can
catch 'the disease it they have
let their resistance deteriorates
Good nutrition, sufficient rest
and atemse best prevent the
onset of “mono."

The Health Center
that it treated 26 cases of the
disease during the last school
year. In the school years trom
1959 to 1965, tram eight to 19
cases were reported each year.

In the early 1950's, the num-
ber of cases reported was rew

or none. Although there appears _

to have been an increase in the
incidence of “menu" at Grinnell,
Mrs. Hall has indicated that it
“may have been just as promi~
nent" ten or fifteen years ago.
but that "doctors are more
monoconscious now.”

marks with the announcement
that this will be his third and
last year as faculty adviser to
the Senate. He began on an 6114
couraging note: “I would like to
begin by assuring you that the
decision to retain the Senate as
a legislative body or SGA was a
wise one.” Kurtz said he felt
that the Senate is deﬁnitely an
“appropriate arm oi sea."

In appraising the potential of
the Senate, KuI'tz set forth three
ambitious objectives.

He began by calling for “ar-
ticnlate, manageable" discus

sion groups on campus, saying
that the Senate should serve to
stimulate interest in such
groups. Kut'tz feels it is impop
tant, however, that these dis
cussion groups deal wnh proh-
lems out of the classroom Con<
text.

lll addition to stimulating
discussion, the Senate must
maintain a constructive critical
role on campus. Kurtz ventured
that it is even legitimate tor a
body such as the Senate to be
Critical of the faculty when
there is 21 need for such criti-
msrn. He said it is even more
important to be critical of the

college as a whole -— particu<
larly the way the college “artic-
ulates its aims and purposes."
He went on to praise the con-
cept of the encampment.

Finally, it is crucial that the
Senate help to maintain the
tt‘adItIon of a “social co n.
science.” Kurtz mentioned the
possibility or projects in the
realm or social problems, cit-
ing mental health as one ex.
ample.

In line with Kurtz’s last sug-
gestion, Phil Bertenthal, senator
from North Younker and this
year's National Student Associas
tion coordinator, mapped out
plans for revitalizing the role of
NSA on the Grinnell campus.
Bertenthal reported that there
are tederal workstudy grants
available from the government
for work in off-campus projects.
He mentioned Tama. the Bot.
toms ared in Des Moines, and
work along the lines of Uncle
Sam's Club as several possibili-
ties,

The prospect or getting dele-
gations or foreign students to
visit Grinnell is another area in
which NSA could be helpiul.
Bertenihal said,

In response to a proposal by
Bertenthal. the Senate passed a
resolution to form a committee
that will work with the NSA co-
ordinator in developing ideas in
the realm of public affairs.

NORTH CAMPUS It Mo‘s

By JIM WILSON

The great Sigmund Freud
stated in one of his scholarly
works that "any kind or trus-
rtration, any thwarted instinct-
ual satisfaction, results or may
result in a heightening of the
sense of guilt." In order to
relieve the many frustrations
caused by the academic lite
and to reduce the sense or
guilt caused by certain actions
in the last two weeks the men
or North Campus have return-
ed to the football ﬁelds and
tennis courts for another year
of I. Ml’s. ' f

The football season opene
Monday with easy victories for
gates, who beat South 234, and
Dibble, who ran over Smith‘
BM. North also won out over-
the chicanery or Cowles Hi,
Tuesday saw West nip Rawson
8-0, and East pummel-Langan
dl-ol East must have an

awful lot of frustration and
guilt feelings. South was again
defeated, this time by Clark,
17-6.- Dibble looks like the
éam to heat but this will take
some doing.

Tennis is again being run as
a team sport. Dan Markman,
head or the program, says that
this is to enable more people
to participate in the intramural
program and it- seems to be
rulrilling its purpose very well.
North. Smith, and East figure
to be the powers in tennis in
what should be an interesting
season. ,

A Clinic for officials has been
instituted this year and the pay
oi the officials has been in-
creased. This should improve
one of the major short comings
of the program; the need for
competent officiating. All in all
it looks like it should be a Very
cathartic year on North Cam-
pus.

week in antimpatlon at its open-
er against Cornell two weeks
from tomorrow Coach Edd
Bowers continues to be cau-
tiously optimistic by saying that
the Pioneers have as good a
chance as anybody to take the
conference crown.

B ow e rs is particularly
pleased by the great amount at
depth that the Pioneers have
this year - something that has
been lacking in past years.

At the moment he has an
offensive line that has only one
non - letterman in it. At 0i-
tensive ends he names senior
Tom Hill and Junior Jim POL
son as the leaders Olher first
stringers are Junior Phil Wood-
ward and co . captain Rick
Andersnn at the tackles, sopli
Bub Lillls and junior Jnhn Pitb‘
man at the guards.

The defensive line, all vet.

son and Nerd Brue at ends,

Coach Ray Obermiller. some
what optimistic this season, re-
marked that “things have been

looking belter.’ Although sixth ‘

man Steve Home is out with a
lame foot, he noted, there are
three new additions to the six
man varsity squad, These three
are not quite ready for real
competition, says Obermiller,
but they should be genuine as-
sets to the squad as the sea-
son moves along,
Concentrating primarily on
long distance training, Coach
Obermiller has lately begun
working his boys on shorter

sprints. Through all of its pun.
ishing practices, mentioned the
coach, the team has maintained
good spirit, .

The Pioneers will really get
a tough run in their opener.
Drake has a rugged team fea-
turing many outstanding in<
dividuals, including four sophO‘
mores who were all state
champs in their high school
days. In the National freshman
twomile meet. Kansas—led by
world milerrecord holder. Jim
Ryan — was the only schoul to
beat the Bulldogs.

Obermiller also hopes tor
good things from his ir‘eshmau
cross-country runnersr Although
most oi the boys on the large
freshman team are inexper-
ienced, explained the coach,
eight or nine have the potential
to become outstanding runners.

much backfield depth as he
would like because of having
