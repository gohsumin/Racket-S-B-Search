Admssiolis and Confusion ‘

Inquiries concerning the Grinncll admissions policy:
particularly in connection with the class of 1965 have beell
directed to both this office and that of the Student Govern:
ment Association. Essentially students and facility are askv;
lug two maioi questions. Why is thele a notable decrease
in. the pcicentag'e of fleshman students from the East!
(there are 11 percent as compared with the 20 percent
of last year‘s class) and why, if our admissions policy
is conceined with leflecting' in its population choices a
geographical sampling of students are only 11 pel cent from
the Atlantic States this yeai, and about 2'5 per cent from
the Iowa region 01' about 50 per cent from the Iowa-
Illinois legion? , l

These inquiries are not to be blushed off easily since
it would seem to be a valid conceln of the student bodyi
and faculty to ascertain how fellowvclassmates and studentsi
are to be chosen from the many applicants, sillce these
classmates do much to determine the tone not only of class-l
loom activity, but formal and informal activity which takes:
place outside of the classroom. ' 1

another. but from the facts as
they affect each group and each,
thinker.

Although the opinions express,

Laurels go to Cowles hall for attempting something
new in the way of orientation proglalnming Last weckl
' Cowles voted unanimously to abolish the present prepping
illoglam in their hall and substitute a personal apploaoh
p ogram devoid of n1att1esses,fiie chills and the usual ob~

Our Last Words

We often point with pride to the fact that 0111' Grin
nell community ofi'els an oppoltunity to expelience a max
imum number of views and opinions and a minimum 01;
‘pressure to accept any one of them. And this boast gene1‘1l—
ly holds true si\ and a half months of the school year.

But it would be unrealistic to suggest that during the

x weeks covered by the freshmen orientation program,
the class of '65 is not press d into believing that hall‘
'tmity and the Grinneli tradi on are supreme, inviolable,l
yLlnquestionably desirable and ultimately necessary for :1
meaningful four years at Grinnell.

We certainly do not condemn the hope of any person‘
.at Grinnell that his hall may become a showcase of cooperar

We and competitive spi t. And that a feeling of close

endship develop among the halls members, which noilld
'cal y on even into the years past college.

But we do condemn this same person when he tries

i to force feed his ideas into the minds of freshmen on the
, grounds that “you have to make ’em find out what hall
fellowship is because they’ll never find out themselves.”

i What about the fellow who came to Gl'illllell believing
.our claim that we have no social fraternities but who, in»
lstead, finds his hall elders doing theil' best to make a
Iflaternity out of their hall {01 fool of it becoming ”just
la do1"."mit01y

! We maintain that most freshmen come to Gl'innell
llooking for a certain amount of fellowship, that most would
‘participate‘in hall and campus activities it only their
,upperclass brethren would prOVidc an example

i Fell too many people here say “this is 11 but we ulc go-
ing to do to you freshmen to make sure you become fulll'
acquainted with Grinnell and our hall. ’ Too fen say “this is
11 hat Glinncll offers you and we hope that, like us, you will

find it valuable. " l

which Grinnell and college life

Dccidedly, and admittedly, the

campus favor a rigorous prc —

lien, the faculty, a vocal rhi—
nority of students and, most im-
portant, the law demand re-
straint.

Under pressure from both
forces, the presidents of halls
engaged in prepping are in a
dilemma. T h e s e presidents
certainly have a responsibility
to their constituency; yet, if
we are to uphold the concept
of student government and

1self-enforcement, the greatest

reSronsihility is to the consti-

No other aspect of the crisis

speech: according to Kennedy
America must Choose to defend,

But iathei than the Clucmll
decision of the matter, this is a
gross misrepresentation of the
truth. Such dishonesty should be
vehemently condemned whether-
it occurs in America or the 50-,

this speech to our knowledge. ,

Should the SeViet Union fear a

a stioiig United States?

Let us View the situation from
the Russian side of the Iron
Curtain. Seventeen million Russ
sians perished as a result or the
Nazi invasion of the Soviet
Union.

In the West German Adenauer
government of today twelve out
of seventeen cabinet members
and high officials were once
Nazis; 84 percent of the ambas-
sadors and leading diplomats in
the Bonn foreign office had pre—
viously worked with Hitler.

The LG, Fai'ben industries.
which supplied Eichmann with
the “Zyklon B gas” are again
dominating German industry;
Hens Globke, legal initiator o:

, the annihilation of the Jews in

the ’305 and ‘405, is Adenauer‘s
rightrhand man today.

And according to F. Yorick
Blumenficld in his recent re-
port on the West German elec-
tions of 1901 (Editorial Re-
search Reports, vol. 11, no. 8),
"German ministgr of defense
Joseph Strauss has said that
anybody who worked against
the Nazis, for whatever reason.
must lie considered a security
risk."

President Kennedy would have
us believe that the Soviet Union
stopped the flow of refugees in.
to West Berlin because of what
this was doing to “their" East
Germany. The Soviet Union has
never tried to build up East Ger—
many as the West has built up
West Berlin. After the war. iac»
tories were actually shipper“!
from Germany to Russia,

The Soviet government felt
that Germany should be left in
destruction in order to learn the
llorror of war. The East Germans
weie foiccd to proclaim the day
of Hitlers deieat as one of their
national holidays. The refugee
problem really indicatcs that the
Soviet Union does not so much
fear a weal; East Germany as
she does a strong West Ger»
man and a united Germany
l0“ . ed towards the West would
undoubtedly be far worse.

Question OtBertin i
And Disarmament
Is Panel Subject

“Berlin and Disarmament"
was the topic discussed at is
.cortee hour sponsored by the
Grinnell Students for Peace yes-
terday iii Younker lounge.

The panel included Joseph
,Wall (history), Alan Jones (his-
tory), Dirk Baay (modern for.
eign languages), and Mike Mone
tross and John Ward, students
Bill Johnson, president of the
Student Peace group, moderate
ed. After the panel had stated
their views, discussion was
thrown open to the audience.

Most oi the discussion cen—

tered around Wall’s statement »

that the United States has
little c oice but. to pull out
oi Berlin or to undertake ha- ‘
sic negotiations with the So—

vict Union. Mike Montross in- ,

troduced the idea oi passive

resistance. which‘ also stimu- .

iatcd much discussion. .

Whereas John Ward felt thati
disarmament is the only wayl
to save the human race ironi,

annihilation, Jones contended}
that it is impossible to disarmi
now because there is no chanca‘
of negotiating. ‘,

A major step in disarmamenti
according to Wall, would be;
the demilitarization oi central,
Europe under a plan propasedl
by Communist Poland in 1956,l
which the United States did noti
then accept.

ENQUIRER

by Ken .Suhiif

Men on campus were asked. \

In your opinion, what it
any, are the changes brought ;
about by the resumption of nu-
clear testing, and what are the
‘possible and results or such a
program?

Capt, Dean K. Mandcville: in
view oi recent world events, it
would appear that our resump-
tion of nuclear testing is a neces-
sary step to insure ourselves or

a military instrument capable or nation and to consult with Thaiicern over
onieiais as to the means where ‘-

supportmg our national
tives '7

Mike nor-watt. ‘63: The most
fundamental sue involved in
the resumption or nuclear test-
ing is whet

oblece

vc: or it he is able
to survwe, \Hll he be able to
withstand the deleterious efi'ects
of strontium so.

it is a sad thing when two
nations, both proclaiming hu-
manistic goals, set themselves
to the task of finding the best
way to.,destroy humanity. It
silt betrayed her total la
sincerity through her rcsump- 4‘
tion of testing.

The United States iiol. only

‘would have a basis of euphort

to protesting nations, but also
would sustain a valuable stategic
and propaganda advantage by
continuing its moritorium on nu-
clear testing,

Ray Horton. '52: It merely
brings home the direction in
which we are travelling. and its,
value, it any. lies in the tact that;
it may wake certain people, not
only in the government but
throughout the country, to the
pos bility of a nuclear war.

Dean Wood: The Russian de
cision to resume testing is a bru»
tai decision, however one looks
at it. The original unilateral den,

,cision to stop testing was used!

to serve specitic purposes oi the
Russian state. it is possible that
this decision was entirely Krus
cllcv’s, consciou y
bring about a s ategic advante
age. .

If, however, Khruschev was ‘
forced into this decision by ,
more militant factions of the ,
Russian regime the implica—
tions are born 3mg. It means
that Russia is in a state of dan- t
gerous instability and even
Khruschev has little control
over itussiau nuclear polio

i feel that the United Sta es
decision to resume testing even
on a limited basis was not to our

‘ advaniage. We could have beIlCi'

rurthered our position by lianele‘
hug the issue as a negotiation
taetor in our tavor and as a
means of winning greater ptlbel
lic approval. ,

Charles Cleaver: The first nlJ~l
vioiis change is a notable iu-l

icrease in leaf and a new kind
‘ol uneasiness in foreign diplo-

macy. This uneasiness could lead
to one of two possible end r
suits, total war or a more rea—
sonable consideration ot the a
race. An obvious third po. '

ity is that we will learn to hrc‘,
with this tension. '
