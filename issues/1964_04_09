1964 Grinnell Mock Political Convention to Involve
YD's. YR's. More than Half Grinnell Student Body

Before it runs its course, the
1964 Grinnell Mock Convention
will have utilized the talents of
over half of the Grinnell stu-
dent body. Heading the stu-
dents’ preparation for the con-
vention have been the Presl«
dents of the Grinnell Young
Democrats and Young Republi-
cans, Dave Evans and Bob
Savage.

Their work has been super-
vised only by C. Edwin Gil-
mour, who, as Director of the
Program in Practical Political
Education, has overseen the en-
tire student preparation for the
convention.

The Vice<Presidents or the
YD's and YR'S, Signe Hanson
and Roger Ferris, are the
chairmen of the Credentials
Committees for the Democratic
and Republican conventions,
It has been their responsibility
for organizing the enlistment of
delegates, assigning delegates
to state delegations, and ar-
ranging the seating oi the dele-
gates oll the convention floor.

The Rules under which the
two conventions will operate
have been prepared by Anne
Bradley for the Democrats and

Jim Parkison for the Republi-

cans.

The two Mock Political
Conventions will be followed
by a Mock Presidential elec-
tion, Tuesday, April 21, using
the slates chosen at the con-
vention. There will be a ten
day period of campaigning
before the election. Voting
machines will be used to
tabulate the results.

 

The task of transforming
Darby Gymnasium into “Con-
vention Hall” has been the re-
sponsibility of Bill Whelan for
the Democrats and Jim Stod-
dart for the Republicans.

Platform committees headed
by Jack Spence and Tom Evans
have worked to formulate the
platforms which will be pre-
sented to the Democratic and
Republican platform sessions
of the Mock Convention.

Tom Fuilmer has been re-
sponsible for co-ordinating the

publicity for the
Convention.

But while the preparation for
the 1964 Convention in the main
has been done by these stu-
dents, the results of the con-
vention itself will be deter-
mined by the actions of the ap-
proximately 600 convention
delegates. it is the votes of
these delegates which will de-
cide the platforms adopted by
the Parties and of greater in-
terest the nominees of each
Party.

The two Mock Conventions being held this week
have involved the work of many students. This issue of
the S & B is an example. Initial planning for the issue
took place in January, assignments for copy were dis-
tributed in February and March, and the bulk of the
copy was in before Spring Vacation. Almost all of the
work has been done by Young Republicans and Young
Democrats who are in charge of some phase of prepara-

-tion for the convention. A special nod of thanks must
go to Tom Fullmer who was over-all supervisor of all

the material going into this

convention issue The date

of publication was advanced so that the paper would
reach the students just prior to the start of the conven-
tion. We would like to congratulate Mr. Gilmour, the
PPPE, and all of the students who have put so much
time and effort into the Mock Political Conventions,

and we would hope that all

students, whether they are

delegates or just observers, would take advantage of
this practical political experience.

 

Approval of Parly Plaiforms
Included in Mock Conventions

By Jack Spence

The Democratic platform
should receive attention un—
precedented in Grinnell Mock
Political Conventions. The ab-
sence of a raceJor the Presi-
dential nomination in the Dem-
ocratic Mock Convention will
permit more time for serious
consideration and debate on
the various planks of the plat-
form.

The Democratic platform
committee expects lively de-
bate on issues such as admis
sion of Red China to the Unit-
ed Nations, Civil Rights. aid to
parochial schools, and Viet
Nam.

Several contradictory goals
make the job of Writing a plat-
form for the Mock Convention
as difficult one. One goal is edu-
cational. The various subcomr
mittees do extensive research
and write planks over broad

‘- areas. But these planks must
also be limited by the time lim-
it considerations at the conven-
tion. Also, they must abandon,
to a certain extent, the schol-
arly approach in favor of a
more colorful presentation at
the convention, a presentation
which will Create interest, con-
ll'oversy, and debate.

The goals of the PPPE and
the Mock Convention indicate
that the process of debating the
platform and bargaining for
votes on various positions are
easily as important a function
as the educational function of.
researching and writing that
platform.

The Democratic platform will
be presented to the convention
Ind voted on Saturday after

 

noon.

By Tom Evans

Formed behind the slogan,
"Republicans Act.” the plat-
form for the Republican Mock
Convention will be presented at
the Republican platform ses-
sion tomorrow afternoon The
document begins by reaffirming
allegiance to the basic prin»
ciples of Republicanism: (l)
the importance of the individ-
ual, (2) equal rights and oppor-
tunities for all, (3) limited gov-
ernment, and (4) fiscal respon-
sibility.

With regard to areas of spe~
cific application, the platform
promises a much stronger and
more directed foreign policy
Republicans believe that the
prestige of tile United States
has fallen badly in the last
four years. They feel that inde-
cision and confusion can be
held mainly responsible for this
decline.

In the area fo civil rights.
Republicans point with pride to
the fact that all of the major
elements of the civil rights bill
passed in the House had been
first proposed in Republican
legislation. Recognizing the
need for even stronger action,
the Republican p arty has
pledged to move ahead in sec
curing equal rights and opporr
tunitles for all.

Action in domestic affairs
will center around a return to
fiscal responsibility and limited
government. It is a long-held
Republican View lhat ihe gov-
ernment’s initial responsibility
is to assure an economic envil'r
onment conducive to the growth
and strengthening of the free
enterprise system.

AGOP Comments on Issues; Wants
Equal Chance for Success for All

. By Phil Johnson

No man's freedom is secure
until all men are free. The goal
of the members of the Republie
can Party is to bring equal op-
portunity to every man. Not
every man wul succeed in all
of his aspirations in life, but
his success Or failure should
be the result of his personal
capacities as a man, not of a
repressive social system, of
legal restrictions, of a lack of
educational opportunities, or of
abject poverty. ~

Civil rights is the most urgent
issue in our domestic life. All
forms of racial discrimination
must be destroyed. Each indi»
vidual Is entitled to equal treatr
ment by all other Americans,
whether by government offi-
cials or by other citizens. He
should be able to vote, live
where he chooses, worklwherr
ever he is qualified, and use
any public facility on the same
basis as any other citizen.

The circle of poverty and
ignorance which binds so many
fellow Americans must be bro-
ken, Educational opportunities
must be provided to the capa-
ble but poor, Training and
placement aid must be extended
to those who do not presently
have the skills to participate
in modern industry. Depressed
areas must be helped back on
their feet, to enable them to
make positive contributions to
the nation.

Wherever possible, these mat-
ters should be dealt with by
local or state governments,
since the federal government is
notoriously inefficient and in-
flexible in operation. However
some states have refused to as-
sume th e i r responsibilities.
Some have themselves actively
violated the principles of equali-
ty which are the strength of our
society. In these cases, there is
no alternative but federal ace
lion,

 

 

In foreign policy, similar
principles apply. The develop-
ing nations should be aided in
reaching economic and political
growth and stability, to the
end that they will become
sound and autonomous citizens
of the world community.

Communism, as it Is pracA
ticed by the Soviet bloc, is a
direct antithesis of all princi-
ples of freedom, both for in-
dividuals and for nations. It
must be resisted actively on all
fronts.

Government itself must be
purged of ihe corruption re
vealed by the scandals of this
administration. The reaction-
aries and obstructionists now
controlling the Democratic
Congressional machine should
be replaced by men anxious to
serve the nation and the princi-
ples of equality which give it
strength.

It is to this end that the Re-
publican Party is dedicated in
1964.

 

Aim of Democrats to Continue.
And Expand Inaugurated Policy

By Marilyn Alt

At this time, the analysis of
campaign issues is difficult
and must be incomplete It
seems most wise to touch on
those issues which are cur»
rently receiving the attention
of the Democratic Party. The
aims of the Democratic pro»
gram are a continuation and
expansion of policies inaugur-
ated during the past four
years.

The tragic death of President
Kennedy in November was a
blow not only to Democrats,
but to the country and the
world. His youthful leadership
had brought a vigor to Ameri-
can politics which had not been
seen for many years. However,
the ascent of Lyndon Johnson
has brought few major
changes. President Johnson
has already demonstrated his
love for and ability in the game
of politics, his commitment to
the programs of President Kenr
nedy, and his willingness to
present policy changes of his
own.

lin‘the midst of plenty. Today
we have seen passed the most
sweeping tax cut in history, one
which will greatly increase
family income. Plans are also
formulated for a second tax cut.
another boost to the economy.
In addition, President Johnson
has moved to cut expenditures
in many other budgetary areas.
These are only examples of
continuing Democratic pro-
gress in the economic sphere.

The field of CiVil rights is
one of the most pressing lac»
ing the United States today.
Under strong Democratic leadr
ership, the past four years have
seen major steps taken in this
area. At present the sweeping
civil rights bill is on the verge
of passage and will be passed
before lhe Congress adjourns
this summer, Passage of this
bill is only a beginning. and
Democrats pledge their contin-
uing support to the fight for
equal rights for all citizens.

Of equal importance is the
current educational crisis. The
number of students pursuing a
higher education is increasing
each year. As the postwar ‘baby
boom' reaches college age, the
problem Will become even
more acute. The federal gov-
eminent niust be willing to

mortar' bill for construction of
higher educational facilities,
and an increase in funds avail-
able for Student loans. We
pledge our continuing suppon
to these and similar programs.

In the field of foreign affairs,
the Democratic Party pledges
its full support to the mainte~
nance of our position as leader
of the free world. In an age

 

Congress say the -

 

such as ours, foreign policy
must be one of strength with
an understanding of others

ideals, A major milestone was
reached in the road to peace
with the negotiation and ratifi-
cation of the Test Ban Treaty
last fall. The initiation of the
Peace Corps during the last
four years has been another
major step.

There are many other areas
which are of major concern to
Democrats — unemployment,
medical care for the aged, agri-
cultural problems, to mention
just a few. The Democratic
Party pledges its full support
to continuing progress in all
of the above areas as we move

Mock Convention Procedures
To Simulate National Rules

By Anne Bradley

In lormulating the rules for
the Young Democratic Mock
Political Convention an at—
tempt has been made to simu-
late as nearly as possible the
rules used at the Democratic
National Convention. Since
there is a total of 2,316 votes,
there will be approximately
one delegate for each seven
yotes.

States will be given the floor
in alphabetical order to make
nominations for President and
VicevPresident. A state which
does not Wish to make a nom-
ination may either pass or
yield to another state.

Nominating speeches will be
limited to four minutes and
seconding speeches to two min-
utes for each Presidential and
Vice-Presidential Candidate.

A delegation may be polled
during the balloting, but an in-
novatlon from the National
Convention is being introduced
to speed up the polling process.
The convention chairman may
send a representative of the
chair to poll a delegation while
the regular balloting Continues
uninterrupted.

At the National Conventions
the rules and procedures of the
House of Representatives are
utilized, but the Mock Conven-
tion Will use Robert’s Rules of
Order since these are more
familiar to the delegates.

The National Convention re
quires that all delegates sup-
port the Democratic ticket in
November, but this has been
eliminated from these rules
since it has no real significance
for the Mock Convention.

By Jim Parkison

The Rules for the Young Re<
publican Mock Convention are
essentially a combination of the
rules which prevail for the Na-
tional Convention and those
which control the annual Grim
nell Student Government Con-
vention. There are however,
lsome notable exceptions to
these rules which have been
instituted to dlzal with the prob»
lems peculiar, to the Mock Con-
vention.

The most important of these
differences is that no unit rule
will be permitted whereby the
entire votes oi a delegation
would go to a candidate who
in a caucus received a major
ity of the delegation’s votes.
Nomination speeches will be
limited to five minutes in dur-
ation. One three minute sec-
onding speech will be permitted
which may be followed by a
demonstration of five minutes.

The same procedure is to be
followed for the nomination of
the Vice- Presidential candi—
dates except that the nominat-
ing speech may not exceed four
minutes and the demonstration
is to be conducted by (112187
gates in place.

Copies of the rules have been
distributed to the delegation
chairmen and the campaign
managers tor the various can»
didates, The rules will be sub-
mitted to the convention this
evening for consideration and
adoption.

Goldwater Speaks

By Mark Ferdinand

The voter cannot expect to
agree with a candidate's total
philosophy, only with his politir
cal philosophy. Moreover, a
vote for a candidate does not
necessarily endorse his entire
political position, only his basic
political principles, Principles
are important, for it is only in
terms of principles that a can-
didate can offer us a program
and indicate his future course,
not by floating abstractions and
contradictory promises about
a miscellaneous Collection of
concrete, short-term issues.
Views on whether the United
States should or should not
withdraw from the United Na-
tions are not principles; views
on whether a nation should or
should not protect its sover-
eignty are princip1e5#prin-
ciples that cover many issues
besides the U, N.

Thus, a principle is an ab-
straction which subsumes a
great number of concretes. It
is only by means oi principles
that men can judge the alterna-
tives conironting them and pro-
ject their future. If a candi-
date does not integrate pieces
meal goals into conceptual
terms, but rather Conducts his
campaign in terms of con-
cretes, he requests the voters
to hand him a blank check for
power. If a candidate evades,
equivocates and hides his stand
under a junkrheap oi random
concretes, it is impossible to
predict his future course of ac-
tion.

With this as a standard, it is

easy to see why Senator Barry ,

Goldwater is the best candidate
in the field today. The major
difference between
and his opponents is this: They
believe that some elements of
ireedom are compatible with
government controls; he be
lieves that some government

controls are compatible with -’

ireedom, In the conscience of a
conservative he wrote. “I have
little interest
government or in making it
more eilicient, for 1 mean to

I stand on the side of individual

GOLDWATER

choice and creativity. I stand
against the gray sameness of
growing government, against
the conformity of collectism,
. r " These principles far out-
weigh the lesser flaws of his
campaign. His direction is
right.

He considers a Civil right “a
right that is asserted and is
therefore protected by some
Valid law," and adds, “There
may be some rights that should

 

also be civil rights. But if we
desire to give such rights the
protection of the law, our re-
course is to a legislature or to
the amendment procedure of
the Constitution. In the mean-
time, we must recognize the
States’ jurisdiction in certain
areas. The definition of States'
Rights is clear in the Constitu-
tion. ”The powers not delegated
to the United States by the
Constitution nor prohibited by
it to the States are reserved to
Lhe States respectively, or to
the people.” Throughout the
present “civil rights“ contro-
versy, for example, States'
Rights implies ”That the States
have a right to act, or not to
act, as they see fit."

Underlying these legal pre<
cepts is the notion that “esserb
tially local problems are best
dealt with by the people most
directly concerned” Goldwat-
er has repeatedly said: “We
can’t pass a law that will make
you like me or me like you.
This has to be done between
us." He makes a sharp distinc-
tion between the civil rights
that are guaranteed under the
Constitution and the rights of
association which are basically
moral issues and cannot be
solved simply by passing unen-
forceable laws.

FDR Influences Senate Service.
Helps Shape Background of [B].
Dems' Only Presidential Candidate

Four years ago the Grinnell
Scarlet and Black ran an ar-
ticle on each of the hopefuls for
President. Side by side were
printed articles about John F.
Kennedy and Lyndon B, John
son, two men whose back-
grounds were vastly different.
yet whose futures were to be
inextricably interlocked.

Johnson possessed those
"humble beginnings” which
are supposed such an asset in

JOHNSON

political life. Born the eldest
child of a frontier Texas legis~
lator in 1908, Johnson spent his
boyhood in a land of poverty.
He was quick to sense the ne-
cessity of hard work and edu-
cation and worked his way
through Southwest Texas State
Teachers College by holding
down sometimes as many as
{our jobs. In college he ma»
jorcd in government and his-
tory, was student body presi-
dent and a campus leader.

Johnson’s Washington career
began in the opening days of
the New Deal when he became
employed there as an assist-
ant to a Texas congressman.
During his stay in Washington,
where he became known as
one of the best assistants on
Capitol Hill, he met two people
who were to have a profound
affect on his life: Franklin D.
Roosevelt and Claudia Taylor,
known since childhood as
"Lady Bird.”

At the age of 25 Johnson tem-
porarily left Washington to
take over the state directorship
of the National Youth Admins
lstration. In this capacity he
helped many students make
their way through school in de»

pression years and set the pre-]
c e d e n t of establishing an:

N. Y. A. program for Negro
youths in Texas. It was from
this post that he resigned to ,re«
turn to Washington in 1937 fol-
lowing his first successful cam-
paign for Congress.

His friend of earlier Washing
ton days, Roosevelt, did not
forget him and in 1940 when
Democratic control of me
House was threatened, it was
to Johnson that F, D. R. com-
mended the national campaign
to retain a Democratic major-

 

ity, Johnson succeeded so well
in his task that not only was
the House held in Democratic
control, but the majority was
increased as Well,

Johnson Continued to be a
vigorous New Deal supporter
and in 1941 he was la key ad-
ministration leader in th e
House right for a two-ocean
Navy. It was in this same year
that he announced, from the
White House steps, his candi-
dacy for the United States Sen-
ate,

When war came in 1941. John»
son Voted for and became the
first member of Congress to
enlist in the war. He won the
Silver Star for gallantry in ac-
tion while in the South Pacific
and was decorated by General
MacArthur. _

With his return to Congress
in 1948 Johnson soon showed
the ability which made him in
1960 the most powerful man in
the Ui S. Senate. The tremend-
ous influence he exercised on
such committees as the Naval
Affairs committee in the House,
Armed Services committees of
both House and Senate, the
Joint Congressional Committee
on Atomic Energy and the Sen-
ate Committee on Space and
Astronautices as well as the
fact that Johnsonded Demo-
crats won overwhelmingly in
1952, '54, and ’56 are substan»
tial proof of his power.

The Johnson appeal of re—
sponsibility, preparedness and

leadership enabled him to win'

every showdown voting test as
majority leader.

The supreme test of his "re-
sponsibility, preparedness and
leadership” came on Novem-
ber 22, 1963 when tragedy
called for a man of both per-
sonal and political strength and
Johnson was capable of giving
such strength. The strength
which held a country together
for those few dark days has in
no way diminished in recent
months as Johnson has pressed
to secure the goals of our late
President as well as forward»
ing many of his own ideals.

Innocuous Vice President ti Dangerous luxury for Present,
Hubert Humphrey Offers Necessary Experience, Greatness

By Dennis Murphy

Neither the Republicans nor
the Democrats can longer at-
ford the luxury of nominating
for Vice President innocuous
candidates whose sole purpose

is to balance the ticket geoA
graphically, ideologically, or
religiously. The man nominated
for Democratic VicevPresiden-
tial Candidate must possess all
the ability, experience, and con~
fidence required by the office
of President — and he must
show promise of becoming a
truly great President. It is our
sincere belief that Senator Hu—
bert Humphrey of Minnesota
shows that promise.

Senator Humphrey holds no
claim to striking good looks;
he does not represent a popu-
lous northeastern State, Hum-
phrey is, instead, one of the
most influential men in Wash-
ington; he is a Liberal without
reservations whose record of
progressive legislation dates
back to his first elective office,
“I believe in the liberalism of
advocacy and action," related
Humphrey in an article for the
Phi Beta Kappa Journal. Liber-
alism should be equated with
“Man’s striving for Civilization

and dignity." It is a . . phi~
losophy willing to use the state
to achieve freedom."

Few modern political figures
have a record of accomplish-
ments to compare with that of
Senator Humphrey. As Mayor
of Minneapolis from 1945-43,
Humphrey established the first
Fair Employment Practices
Commission in the United
States In the 1948 Democratic

National Convention, when the
passage ot a mild Truman
backed Civil Righbs plank
S e e m E d imminent, Senator
Humphrey addressed the Con<
vention with these provocative
words: “I say this: that the
time has arrived in America
for the Democratic Party to
get out of the shadow of states
rights and walk forthrightly
into the bright sunshine of hu<
man rights." Passage of the
strongest Civil Rights plank in
the history of the party fol-
lowed this powertul plea—and

, the Southerners walked out or

' the Convention,

No man deserves greater

who set up and headed the Sen-
ate Disarmament Subcommite

Ouiet Efficiency Qualities Shriver.
World Symbol of Peace. Progress

By Linda Neal
and

James Randall
Because the assignments give
In to Sargent Shriver have
characteristically been Com-
pleted quietly, with unobtrusive
eriiciency, few people realize
the extent and diversity of his

background and experience.
Shriver is best known for the

organization and direction of

the late President Kennedy's

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

\
SHRIVER

Peace Corps. What is not wide<
Iy known, however, is his per
sonal sponsorship, guidance,
and committment to the Corps.
Taking on the responsibility for
its passage, he met with 363
Congressmen and Senators to
discuss why it was needed and
how it would operate,

With the help of Vice-Presi—
dent Johnson, Shriver discour-
aged Congressional efforts to
attach the Corps to the for-
eign aid bill, and to associate
it with the United States Diplo»
matic Corps, feeling that such
political a n d nationalistic
strings would defeat the pur-
pose of a separately conceived
peace organization. With such
optimistic realism, he ever-
came deep Congressional skep»
ticism to garner the second
largest margin of victory for
an administration proposal:
59732 in the Senate, and 283-
97 In the House.

He then went on to devote
himself wholeheartedly to its
success, making decisions rang-
ing from publicity literature,
to the texts to be used in train-
ing volunteers, and traveling
to SI countries in Central and
South America, Africa, Asia
and the Near East to make all
necessary arrangements tor the
Corps. During the past three
years, he has become intimate-
ly acquainted with the prob-
lems of these underdeveloped
nations and has come to sym-
bolize to these people man’s
desire for peace and progress,

The background of Sargent
Shriver is similarly character
ized by ability and public serv-
ice. Born in 1915 in Maryland,
he attended parochial schools,
and later Canterbury School in
Connecticut. He was admitted
to both Yale University and
Yale Law School on scholar-
,ships. and Was graduated from
lithe latter cum laude in 1938,

During the summers of ’31, '38,
and '39 he led groups of stu-
dents through Fronce and Ger—
many on the Experiment in In-
ternational Living plan, reflect-
ing his deep interest in the
non-American societies of the
world.

On his return from World
War II, Shriver was offered the
Assistant General Manager-
ship of Joseph Kennedy's new~
ly acquired Chicago Merchan-
dise Mart. There he re-organ-
ized the administration of the
Mart, and sought out new
and more internationally di-
verse tenants. After working
ior two years with Eunice Ken-
nedy on the Citizens Committee
on the Control and Prevention
of Juvenile Delinquency, under
the auspices of the Attorney
General, he returned to Chica-
go to become associated with
the administration and fund-
raising of twenty-five educa-
tional, hospital, cultural, wel-
fare, and charitable groups.

In 1955 he was selected as the
President of the Chicago Board

‘of Education, a position he held

until his resignation in 1960.
During that time, he quintupled
publicrschools construction, cut
costs by 17 per cent, up-graded
the school curricula, and suc-
Cessfully lobbied school board
measures through a reluctant
Illinois legislature.

Shriver's importance in John
Kennedy’s 1960 c a m p a i g n
stemmed from his work on
Chicago's Catholic Interracial
CounCll. He and some Negro
friends set up a special civil
rights division, aimed at the
urban Negro, It was his con<
cern that prompted Kennedy to
call the Martin Luther King
family upon King's arrest and
imprisonment.

, Constant effort, and consist-
ently high quality of achieve-
ment in projects undertaken
have earned Shriver wide
praise from Congress and
those with whom he has
worked. This attitude recently
manifested itself in the appr0<
priation of $100 million for the
Corps, an increase of $70 mil-
lion and 10,000 volunteers from
1961; and President Johnsons
appointment of him to head the
Office of Economic Opportun<
ity. In this capacity, Shriver
would be ”directly responsible”
for the new programs in John-
son’s war against poverty, even
though it would "extend his au—
thority into a variety of Cabi-
net dcpartments.” President
Johnson speaks of him as "one
of the most brilliant, most able,
and most competent officials
in government. I regard him as
one or my real confidants."

, While not feeling “equipped:
to classify himself as an intel-
lectual, he describes himself
as “liberal in concern and phil»
osophy.” This Concern can be
seen in the fact that he and his
wife, Eunice, raised three fos-
ter daughters sent to them by
the Chicago Juvenile CourtI in
addition to their own four chil-
dren, The content of his philo-
sophy can be best judged by
his actions, which ‘speak loud-

 

er tlian words.’

Robert Kennedy, Democratic Vice-Presidential Possible,
Characterized as Determined, Knowledgable, Experienced

Robert Francis Kennedy was
born on November 2|), 1925. in
Brookline, Massachusetts. He
lived for a brief period in New
York attending public school
in Bronxville. but his father
then moved to London as the

KENNEDY

United States. Ambassador and
Robert attended successively
the Gibbs School in London,
Portsmouth Priory in Rhode
Island, and Milton Academy in
Massachusetts. From there he
went to Harvard, and finally to
the University of Virginia for
his LLB degree.

Upon graduation from the
law school in Virginia, Kennedy
went straight to work for the
government. He spent seven
months working for the Justice
Department and otherwise has
worked only as counsel for
Congressional committees. In
his words, “I never even cone
sidered anything else.” In 1353
he was hired by the Hoover
Commission investigating the
reorganization of government,
but after a year joined Senator
McCarthy's committee as min-
ority counsel.

Then in 1055, the Democrats
won control of the Senate and
John McClellan of Arkansas
became the committee chair
man. With Kennedy now enter
counsel, che committee first hit
pay dirt with the Harold Tal-
bott and Robert T. Ross con-
flict - of - interest cases. In the
process of investigating govern-
ment contractors. Kennedy
learned of their payoffs to labor
union chiefs. He was intrigued
by labor-management collusion
and went into the subject more
deeply. As a result, the Senate
set up a special committee,
Withr McClellan in command
and Kennedy as counsel, to con-
centrate on this chicanery.

All this made Kennedy a na-
tional figure and brought him
before the public by means of
newspapers, television, and his
best selling book, “The Enemy
Within” which dealt with his
efforts on the Rackets Commit—
tee.

In 1980, after successfully
managing his brother's presi-
dential campaign, he was ap-
pointed to the position of Attor-
ney General. In this capacity
Kennedy displayed his deter—
mination to be successful ill
whatever he undertakes, Im-

mediately he lobbied for new

anti-racketeering laws in Con-
gress_and set up a 54 lawyer
unit to coordinate reports from
the 26 United States investiga-
tive agencies on organized
crime.

He prodded the Internal Rev-
enue intelligence to boost its
time allotment for pursuing
racketeers from four to 47 per
cent, and as a result, racketeelu
ing prosecutions in 1562 were
up 700 per cent over 1960, con-
vtctions were up over 400 per
cent, and 92 civil anti-trust
suits were filed which was an
all-time high. In addition price
fixing indictments were ob-
tained against or companies
and 154 individuals, and the
number of active cases to win
Negroes the vote has quadru-
pled in two years and 23 voting
rights lawsuits have been filed
in strategic positions.

Kennedy’s experience is not
limited to just the above men-
tioned examples, however, De-
scribed by U. S. News St World
Report as "grass roots ambas-
sador to everywhere” and as
knowing" better than any other
member of the administration
what makes people tick in
many capitals far from Wash-

ington,” his duties weren't just
limited to the JustiCe Depart-
ment, He has debated with the
Japanese Communists, helped
to settle the Dutch Indonesian
dispute over West New Guinea,
played a vital role in the furor
over an increase in steel prices,
made a flying trip to Brazil to
discuss her economic crisis
with President Joao Goulart,
took a critical part behind the
scenes in the Cuban prisoner
ransom and directed the, ad-
ministration’s planning on
youth employment and delin-
quency. culminating in the pro-
posal for a domestic Peace
Corps.

Robert E Kennedy has shown
himself to possess a great Varie<
ty of political experiences. a
proven national record, and an
intense dedication to whatever
he undertakes.

Nelson A. Rockefeller ls Named as Best GOP Possibility
To Provide Contrast to Present Administration's Tenor

Nelson A. Rockefeller, Gov-
ernor of New York, is far and
away the best man for the Re-
publican presidential nomina-
tion. To provide a contrast to
the dull, sluggish Democratic

ROCKEFELLER

YAdministration, the Republi-
cans need a liberal, dynamic,
experienced candidate. Turn-
ing to an extremist candidate
would not be to the advantage
of the party; the American
people want a man as president
who recognizes and knows how
to meet the problems of our
largely urbanized, complex so-

 

ciety, The place for a sincere
conservative like Barry Gold-
water is the Senate, where he
can do his rabble-rousing with
out ,seriously affecting the
course of our nation,

Governor Rockefeller, is the
most qualified person for the
office of president. Six years as
executive head of New York
has certainly given him great
experience in dealing with
problems that an executive
must face, His re-election in
1962, when the Democrats dom-
inated the New York Senate
and House races, showed the
confidence the people of New
York have in him and indicated
their approval of the job he has
done.

Since the problems of the
United 'States—ever-lncreasing
urbanization with strong rural
interests—are present in minia-
ture in New York, Governor
Rockefeller has in the past 6
years been dealing with prob-
lems similar to those which
would face him if elected pres-
ident.

Rocketeller‘s a o c o mplish-
ments as governor of N. Y. are
too numerous to mention, but
some of the more outstanding
are: (1) He wiped out a $700,-
000,000 deficit inherited from
the Democratic Administra-
tion; (1) By 1962, per Capita
income in the state reached a
new high, about 25% over the

 

national average; (3) School
aid from the state to local
districts nearly doubled from
1958‘t0 1562; (4) accomplished
a more than ten-fold increase
in the housing program for
middle-income families.

Rockefeller has served as an
aide to 3 previous presidents
of the United States, Only 32
years old in 1940, he was ap-
pointed Assistant Secretary of
State for Latin American af~
fairs by F, D. R. Later he
played an instrumental part in
planning Truman’s Point Four
foreign aid program, which
many people in Washington re
garded as a Rockefeller crer
ation. Under Eisenhower, he
drew up a blueprint for the
first dept of Health, Educa-
tion and Welfare, served as its
first vicepresident, planned a
reorganization of the Defense
Dept. and became assistant in
charge of cold war strategy

Rockefeller’s political and
administrative experience ‘is
quite diversified. having served
in 2 Democratic and l Republi-
can administrations and 6
years as governor of a politi-
cally lei-polarized statel His
initial job as Assistant Secre-
tary of State has given him
experience in and a knowledge
of foreign affairs, which he
has aptly demonstrated in the
past and present presidential
campaigns.

 

lodge Has Tradition of Ability in Diplomacy, Politics;’
Became Well Known While Eisenhower's UN Ambassador

Millions of nationally con-
lcious Americans between the
years of 1952 and 1960 saw, in
Henry Cabot Lodge's public
natements addressed from the
United Nations, 3 much needed,
consistent statement of the
United States foreign policy
within the context of the "cold
war." In 1960, as the Vice-Pres-
idential running mate of Rich-
ard Nixon, he continued to em-
phasize the difficulties of the in-
ternatlonal situations

Now, just several weeks past,
the people who had followed
Lodge’s long diplomatic back—

ound joined with others who

tely had come to view him as
most capable of uniting the Re
publican effort, and together
they brought about a remark-
able victory for Lodge in the
New Hampshire primary. His
success in New Hampshire was
even more remarkable in that
Lodge was not personally pres-
ent to lead his supporters; he
did not issue an official word
on his own behalfl

What is it about Lodge that
calls for his kind of loyal sup-
port? What enigma does Henry
Cabot Lodge Jr., present to the
political analyst? What kind of
a program does he offer to the
,voter?

 

Above all, Lodge is a diplo»
mat. His interest in foreign
affairs carries an aura of tra-
dition, for his grandfather,

Henry Cabot Lodge, Sr., him-
self a famous United States
Senator from Massachusetts,

 

LODGE

was quite vocally involved in
a period of international cri-
sisl But the senior Lodge had
distingushed himself under T.
Roosevelt and Wilson as an
isolationist, a position that his
grandson adopted at the begin-

 

ning of his senatorial careers
It is to Lodge, Jrl’s credit that

he was able to make an about-
face in response to the post
World War international prob»
lem; after 1944 he became a
strong internationalist, on rec-
ord in favor of the North At-
lantic Treaty and the Marshall
Plan.

Following his thirteen years
as a U. S. Senator from Massa-
chusetts (1932-1952 with a break
for war service), Lodge was
chosen by Dwight D Eisen-
hower to be his ”chief liaison
officer on all government mat—
ters except the budget,"—to a
position which later in that
year led Lodge to the post of
head of the United States Mis-
sion to the United Nations, He
served as head of the UN dele-
gation for eight years A back-
ground journalism (Harvard)
followed by eight years on the
political news and editorial
staff of the New York Herald

lems of foreign policy evi-

Experience Qualifies Richard Nixon
For Top National Leadership in '64

By John Tepasko

Richard Milhous Nixon was
born January 9, 1913 and grew
up in the community of Whit-
tier, California, Where his par-
ents ran a combination filling
station-grocery store, A ft e r
graduating from high school,
he went on to work his way
through Whittier College. He
graduated second in his class
in 1934. He was awarded a
scholarship to Duke University

NIXON

Law School, and in 1937 re-
ceived his L. Li D. degree.

He returned to California to
gactice law with a firm in

hittier for five years During
this period he married Patricia
Ryan, an attractive Whittier
school teacher. Nixon left the
Whittier law firm to become a
member of the legal staff of
the office of Price Administra-
lion in Washington.

After five months Wiﬂh O. P.
A, he was commissioned in the
Navy as a lieutenant, serving
in the South Pacific for 13
months with the Combat Air
Transportation He earned two
battle stars and two commen-
dations.

In 1946 Nixon was elected
congressman from his district
in California. During his first
year in Congress he spent two
months in Europe as a mem-
ber of the Herter Committee to
study the Marshall plan He

 

also participated in the draft-
ing of the Taft-Hartley Labor-
relations act. By 1948 his pop-
ularity and hard work had
earned him the nomination of
both parties ‘for another term
under California’s cross filing
system.

Nixon attracted national no—
tice for his work on the
House Un-American Activities
committee in exposing Alger
Hiss. Not often mentioned are
the reforms of that committee
which he introduced to protect
the right of the individual.

At the time he said, ”It is
essential also to be extremely
careful in this field, where a
man’s reputation can be de-
stroyed by accusations of Com-
munist affiliation, to distinguish
between an individual who is a
voluntary participant in the
Communist conspiracy and one
who innocently may have had
contact with it."

In 1950 Nixon won the sad
ate election by a wide margin
and in both 1952 and 1956 was
selected as Dwight Eisenhow-
er’s running mate. During his
tenure of the vice-presidency,
it was transformed from a rela-
tively insignificant office to
an office of great responsibility
and public significance.

In addition to his constitution-
al duties as president of the
Senate, Nixon was a statutory
member of the National Se—
curity Council, actively partici-
pated in cabinet deliberations
and presided over meetings of
both in the absence of the
President.

With a friendly dignity which
has brought credit to his coun-
try, he has visited over 50
countries throughout the world
as the President’s personal
representative and brought hon-
or 'to his country.

He was chairman of the
President’s committee on GovA
ernment Contracts, which seeks
to eliminate racial and religi-
ous discrimination in the em»
ployment policies of firms hav-
ing contracts with the federal
government He was also the
chairman of the Cabinet Com»
mittee on Price Stability for
Economic Growth.

 

GOP Senator Margaret Chase Smilh Seeks Presidency,
Predicts ‘An Inescapable Future in Politics for Women’

By Larry Hultgren

Mrs. Margaret Chase Smith
resides in Skowhegan, Maine.
She has served the Republican
Party as a key member of the
House of Representatives from
1940-1949. in 1948 she was
elected to the Senate by the
highest percentage majority
and the greatest total vote ma-
jority in the history of Maine.
She has served in the U. S,
Senate from 1948 to date.

Again in 1960, when she was
re-elected to a third term in
the Senate, she was the top
vote getter of all candidates
for all offices—setting a new
all time record for Maine in
the number of Votes.

She is the only woman ever
to have been elected to three
full terms in the United States
Senate. She is the only woman
to serve in both houses of
Congress. Mrs, Smith’s coms
mittee service in the House has
d r a w in special Presidential
commendation. In the Senate
she has served as a member of
all the major committees and
has presided as chairman for
many nationally important
committees, having been cited

tors, and served as a. signal to
Washington and Moscow that
the Senate might ratify a test
ban treaty.

The Test Ban Treaty was not
the only accomplishment of the
Kennedy Administration which
owed its existence to Senator
Humphrey, On June 15, 1960,
Humphrey introduced a bill to
establish the Peace Corps—
several months before Presi-
dent Kennedy voiced the idea
in the closing days of his cam-
paign.

Respect for Hubert Hum-
phrey is nowhere higher than in
academic circlesr He is himself
a graduate (Phi Beta Kappa)
from the University of Minne-
sota and former Professor of
Political Science at Macalester
College. Humphrey has contin-
uaily stressed the vital role of
higher education in modern
industrial society.

 

 

principles of the Republican
party In a recent speech Mrs.
Smith said: “Today we have
a Democratic Administration
that has developed a mania for
loose spending and loose pro-
grams. History is repeating it-
self— and the Republican Par-
ty again has the opportunity to
emerge as 'the champion of
unity and prudence.”
Ambitious candidates have
continually q u i z z e d Mrs.
Smith as to the proper place

‘ of a woman in our society. Her

answer is short and simple.
"Women’s proper place is ev—
erywhere.” There is a definite

Stevenson’s only official gov-
ernment association was his
enlistment in the navy. But in
1933 his service witli the Agri-
culture Adjustment Adminis-
tration in Washington inaugura
ated his government career.
in his post with the Agricul-
ture committee, Stevenson
helped President Roosevelt
construct a program to relieve
~farmers suffering the effects of
inflation and depression. The
legislation enacted during this
crisis proved to be the most
meaningful farml improvement
program of the century.

In 1935, Stevenson left the
government to go into private
practice with a Chicago law
firm. But he returned to act
as Special Assistant and per-
sonal counsel to the Secretary

of the Navy from 1941 to 1944.
Also, in 1943 Stevenson headed

a mission to ltaly to help with ,

the reconstruction of the liber-
ated but war-ravaged country.

In 1945 Stevenson moved into
truly international politics by
assisting in the preparation of
the United Nations organiza-
tion. During planning, Steven-
son traveled extensively, and
increased the United States’
prestige in world affairs At
the first meeting of the U. N,
General Assembly, Adlai Stev—
enson represented our gover
ment again, in the post of Sen-
ior Advisor to the United States
delegation

Stevenson returned to the
U. N, in 1945 and 1947, ap—
pointed a United States dele-
gate by President Truman.
Stevenson had proved so vai-
uable that personal politics,
which often governs decisions
on appointments during a
change of administrations, did
not affect his position. Steven-
son’s importance would be dra-
matized during the Eisenhower
administration, when the Re
publicans asked him to serve
with the government. They
called upon Stevenson to act
as an advisor to the Secretary
of State in 1957.

However, in 1948 Mr, Steven-
son left his official post to serve
his party by running for Gov-
ernor of Illinois. Illinois vot-
ers chose Stevenson by the
largest plurality in the tradi-
tionally-Republican state's his-
tory, and Stevenson repaid
their trust in him by ridding the
state’s government of the core
ruption that had characterized
the previous regime.’ Steven~
son initiated legislation to im-
prove the standards and condi-
tions of education and farm-
ing in the state. Education has
been a major concern of his,
and in his career at the na
tional level he continued to
support educational improve-

Broad and Unique Service Background
Recommends Ribicoff for Nomination

By Harry Shrago

in 1964 the Democrats must
choose a man of unquestioned
ability and experience to be
the running mate of Lyndon
Johnson. That man is Abra-
ham Ribicoff.

Ribicoff would bring to the
vicerpresidency a wide exper-
lence and a broad background
unique in American public af-
fairs. He is the only public of—
ficial who has served as a mem»
ber of a state legislature. a
judge, a member of the Ur S.
House of Representatives, a
governor, a cabinet member,
and now a U, S. Senator.

Ribicoff began his career of
public service in 1938, when he
was elected Representative
from Hartford to the Connecti-
cut General Assembly. He was
reelected in Him Newsmen

 

tat the State Capitol voted him

the ”most able
tive.”

He served two terms as a
judge of the Hartford Munici-
pal Courl, and for a number of
years Ribicoff was a hearing
Examiner under the State‘s

Fair Employment Practices

representa-

Law. In 1948 he was elected tov
the U. 5, Congress from Con-l

necticut‘s First Congressional
District, (Hartford County),
and served two terms.
Before entering the Kennedy
cabinet, Ribicoff had been
twice elected Governor of Con-
necticut; in 1954 by a slim mar-

gin of 3,115 votes, and in 1958'

by the historyrmaking plural-
ity of 246,348 votes.

From January, 1961 until
July, 1962, Ribicofi was Secre—

tlons, and Goldwater’s influ-

He has done more for Arizona

He rests his principles on the
solid foundation of the United
States Constitution, which was
originally instituted as a "sys-
tem of restraint against the
natural tendency of govern-

ment to expand in the direction
of absolutism.” in order to pre-
serve freedom we can not as-

sume “that the State (federal)
is competent to do all things
and is limited in what it actuala
ly does only by the will of those
who control the State."
Goldwater believes ”that un—

good for the country, Unions
can be an instrument for
achieving economic justice for
the working man . . They are
an expression of freedom. . . .
an expression of man’s inalien-

embracing determination of
Communism to capture the
world and destroy the United
States.’

Welfare, in the cabinet of Pres—
ident John F. Kennedy.
As Secretary of HEW, Ribi-

coff was responsible for some
of the most ferreaching inno-
vations in the history of the
nation’s health, education, and
welfare.

An entirely new approach to
Welfare operations was insti-
tuted by Ribicoff, placing greatv
er emphasis on prevention and
rehabilitation.

The Social Security system
was improved by Congress’s

._ adoption of Ribicoff’s proposals

RIBICOFF

 

for lowering the retirement age
for men as well as for women
to 62, raising ren‘rement bene-
fits for widows, and increasing
minimum Social Security pay—
ments more than 20 per cent.

Ribicoff initiated the act
which now provides aid to de-
pendent children whose par~
ents are the victims of unem-
ployment.

Ribicoff was the first HEW
secretary to urge the striking
of the “separate but equal"

 

clauses from the Hill-Burton
Hospital Construction Act and
statutes governing Federal as-
sistance to land grant colleges.

In March, 1562, Ribicoff,
through administrative action,
made the historic decision that

children whose parents live or
work at Government installa-
tions would no longer be re-
quired to attend local public
schools in the Fall of 1963 if
those schools remained segre»
gated, but, instead could attend
desegregated schools on the
Federal bases,

Ribicoff resigned from the
Kennedy cabinet in 1962 to run
for the Senate. His election was
an indication of the great
amount of respect he com-
mands in Connecticut. At the
age of 53, Ribicoff’s back-
ground in politics and govern»
ment at all levels make him
the ideal Democratic Vice
Presidential candidate.

Gov. Romney Is Candidate lo Cope
With Problems. Dangers of 60's

By Ken Adleman

The Republican Party must
choose as its Presidential can-
didate ior 1964 a man who has
proved that he has the ability
to cope with the problems of
the 1960's, and a man Who
recognizes the dangers which
are inherent in big government,
big business, and big unions.
Such a man is George Romney,
the Governor of Michigan.

In 1962 Romney ended a 14
year Democratic dynasty on
the Michigan state-house by de-
feating the Democratic incum-
bent by over 78,000 votes. After
only one year in office Romney
had wiped out the state’s mas-
sive 85.6 million deficit.

Earlier he had shown the
same caliber of ability in in-
dustry. When he was selected
as President of American
Motors Corporation, that firm
was on the verge of collapse.
When he left American Motors
to run for Governor in 1962
that firm had become estab-
lished as one of the most vital
and stable in the automotive
industry.

It was Romney who intro-
duced both the concept and
term of “compact” cars to the
American automotive industry.

Romney firmly believes that
there should he more citizen
participation in government. As
Governor .he has set aside
Thursday mornings to allow
any citizen to come in and dis-
cuss problems. Romney has
said that America desperately
needs a party that is responsive
to the people.

On Civil Rights Romney has
stated time and again his up-
position to “discrimination of
any kind." He has ,criticized
President Johnson’s tax pro-

IOMNEY

gram as a trick saying the de-
ficit will continue at the same '
level.

Romney says that American
foreign policy must adopt a
new outlook. He says that the
policy of the present adminis-
tration has led to the position
where freedom is in retreat all
over the world.

The Republicans can do no
less than nominate the person
who Margaret Chase Smith has
described as the man who is
“probably the most ideal candi—
date in the party." That man
is Governor George Romney
of Michigan.

Endgame, One-Act Play by Sam Beckett

Endgame, a oneract play by

sented as a theatre workshop
project in the Arena theatre,
Sunday, April 12 at 3::30 pin,
and at 8:00 pm and Monday,
April 13 at 8:00 pm

Centered about two charac-
ters, one blind and paralyzed,
the other, his halteson and ser-
vant, the drama explores the
conflicts and relationships be
tween these two as they exist
in an anonymous claustropho-
bic room, the last remnants of
civilization, the survivors, per-
haps, of a halocaust which has
destroyed all of society.

The dialogue of half-phrases,
unanswered questions, and
long pauses, so common to the
so-called “Theatre oi the Ab»
surd," portrays the characters
as they begin to realize the ri—
nal runningdown of their own
existence. It is as critic Martin
Esslin has termed it, “a drar
matic statement of the human
situation itself. . r .'

The cast for Endgame is:

About twenty-five Grinnell College students trekked out to
the Grinnell High School gym Monday night to see what
could probably be called one of the most exciting, or at least
most “starvstudded” basketball games of the 1963-64 season.

The benefit game saw the Iowa All»Stars, led by Drake
star McCoy McLemore down the Iowa Hawkeye seniors by
a score of 81-68. The game was played before a crowd of
about 400 spectators who were able to see some of the state's
best basketball players in action.

The contest, sponsored by the Grinnell Jaycees, was a
money raising project for the Dr. Robert Norton Fund. Dr.
Norton, son of Grinnell Professor Homer Norton, operates a
hospital in the Me Kong Delta of Viet Nam, only a few miles
from much of the guerrilla warfare.

The Grinnell Chamber of Commerce, along with the Grin-
nell Ministerial Association has undertaken this project to
raise $7,500 to help pay for much needed equipment and slip»
plies for Dr. Norton’s hospital.

The lineup for the All-Stars included Grinnell‘s co-cap-
tains Jim Mifflin and John Sundell, McLelnore, Billy Foster,
and Ray Quinn (ex-Drake) of Drake University, and John
Carle, former little All-American from Central College. Mif—
flin and Sundell both were chosen to the All-Conference first
team the Midwest Conference, and McLemore was named
to the All-Conference first team this year in the tough Mis-
souri Valley Conference.

The lowa Hawkeye Seniors fielded a team consisting
of Dave Roach, Joe Reddington, Paul Krause, Bill Skea, Terry
Lyon, and John Raffensberger. All but Krause and Raffens—
berger were members of this year‘s ‘University of Iowa has»
ketball team. Raffensberger was a star at State College of
Iowa several years ago, and Krause starred as a flanker back
on Iowa’s football team, Krause was picked as second round
draft choice by the Washington Redskins of the National Foot-
ball League. -

The main bit of excitement calne in the pregame drills
as 6’9” Ray Quinn, decked out in red knee-high stockings and
With red shoelaces in his white basketball shoes, dunked the
ball a little too hard and broke the glass backboard. The game
finally got underway after a half an hour delay to replace the
backboard.

The first half found the two teams fairly evenly
matched, neither team hitting too well from the floor, and the
half ended with the score at 34-34.

_Early in the second half the Alletars took over the lead
behind the hot shooting of McLemore and the long jump
shots, and the fancy ball handling of Drake’s Billy Foster. The
final gun sounded with the All-Stars well in front, 81-68.

Baseball Team to Open Conference Season

Desplte the return of his
veteran pitching staff, Pioneer
baseball coach John Pfitsch
rests his hopes for the 1964 sea-
son on the development of his
crew of sophomores, five of
whom were in the lineup for the
season opener against Central
College last Wednesday.

The experienced mound corps
is led by Denny Hanssen, one
of the best hurlcrs in the con-
iel'ence last year. Hanssen won
only three of eight decisions in
1963 but compiled a fine L40
ERA While allowing just 36 hits
in 64 innings on the mound. He
also struck out 75.

Another junior, Barry M. An
derson, picked up the remain
ing Grinnell win while losing
three and recorded a 3.10 ERA.

Cal Collier, one of only a
handfull of seniors on the
squad. is counted on to bounce
back to the topilight form of his
sophomore year. Last season

 

Collier had his share of trouble
and ended up 074.

All three pitchers are Solid
hitters and can also double in
the outfield or at first base.

Steve Tilly, the top thrower
for the fresh last year, adds
extra punch to the. pitching
staff but will most likely be
used at shortstop most of the
season. Tilly rate as one of the
top fielders on the club.

At the other positions. veterr
an Dick Ulrich gives Pfitsch a
capable hand at second or
third. Collier and Jim Jenks,
last year’s leading hitters. pro-
vide insurance at first. Pfitsch
also can boast experienced
bench Strength at third in Phil
King and John McDonald.

Rounding out the picture are
the other sophomores. Nick
Nonas is expected to take over
the catching chores for the
Pioneers, a spot that plagued
them in l963. Juniors Don MC-
Wethy and Vern Robinson will
back up Nonas.

In the outfield Dave Synhorst,

John Shierholz and Barry R.
Anderson are tabbed as likely
regulars. All are fast but did
not play last season and need
to prove themselves at the
plate. Anderson also provides
a sure hand around third. Kris
Nash, a good hitter, also seems
likely to See a lot of action in
the outfield.

in the infield three other
sophs are set for back-up roles.
Steve Farber will see action at
short if Tilly pitches and can
hurl creditably himself. Mike

back up the starters at third
and first respectively.

Weather has been the biggest
obstacle this fal‘, limiting Coach

there are no seniors listed on
the roster.

“This will definitely be a

says. “with no seniors around,

Opening at the No. l spot will
be Larry Shannon, who went
undefeated in dual matches last
year, playing in the No. 3 spot.
Right behind him is Ken Cly-
mer, who played in the No. 4
and 5 spots last year.

Currently holding down the
third position is Mike Green-
field, a sophomore who played
in the top spot for tl\e yearlings
last year.

Battling for the other three
spots are Jon Schwartz, Dick
Metzler, and Roger Abendroth.
Schwartz and Metzler were on
the team last year, but saw
little action. Abendroth, Bows
ers thinks, could move up in
the group if he can develop a
game to go with his strong
service.

 

were also undefeated in ninl
matches.

Besides Sellergren the likely
regulars are Eric Miller, who
tied for fourth in the confer-
ence meet, and Russ Harder-
who tied for sixth. The other
spots are still open but the
strongest challengers are Dave
Baetz who was fourth man on
the squad last year and Al
Wheeler. the top freshman
player last season.

Ted Risser and Al Peterson
are the other likely starters.
Other members of the squad
are Mike Miller, a junior, Jeri
Kohlman and Tom Lane, both
sophomores.

Coach Crawford feels that
Knox will again offer the

Scronion's 'Aciion Noi' Words'

Promises GOP

Just who is William Warren
Scranton, Governor of Penn-
sylvania, and why has he roc»
keted to the eminent position
of a potential Republican Presi~
dential candidate? Why do men
like Hubert Humphrey view
'Scranton as the toughest pos-
sible candidate for the Demo-
crats_to defeat in November?

SCRANTON

How did Scranton manage to
achieve such outstanding politi-
cal recognition in just; three
years of government service?

The answers to these ques-
tions can be capsulized: Be-
cause in Scranton’s unassail-
able position as a man whose
public and private motives are
one and the some, he has man-
aged, in one short year, as
Pennsylvania’s governor, to
lead his state in the direction
of amazing political and eco»
nonlic recovery, His progress
has recoived national acknowl-
edgment and approval, Penn-
sylvania, like the U. S. is con-
fronted with the political prob-
lem of the twentieth century—
how to adjust human communi-
ties to the violent jolting of in-
dustrial change.

In 1962 Scranton, fresh from
a tremendous gubernatorial
plurality of 486,000 votes, faced
Pennsylvania‘s problems head—
on. in an aggressive yet sensi—'
ble message to the General As—
sembly he presented his pace-
aetting, progress~making pro-
gram, In less than a year he
had 90% of his program passed
by the legislature. With a ”don’t
tell ’em, show ’em attitude, he
had become more than a talk-
ing governor. His dynamic ad-
ministrative ability and genuine
public interest awarded Penn-
sylvania with a new hopeful
climate, ‘

When Scranton’s outstanding
achievements were recognized
and lnuded, his abilities were
projected on a nation-wide lev-
ei. Americans began to won-
der if he could do for his coun-
try, what he did for his state,
Subjected to such demanding
scrutiny, Scranton denied any
serious thoughts of becoming
a Republican presidential can-
didate. although he admits it
would be his “duty" to accept
an honest draft, Meanwhile, he
has become the most active
non-candidate in t h e field.
Scranton has developed the coy

'Honesi Drofi'

play as effectively as any ma-
jor politician in recent history.
The more he says “no," the
more interest he stirs up.

The 46 year old governor was
born and raised ten miles
north of Scranton, Pennsylvan-
ia, the city that bears the name
of his early ironrsmelting an-
cestors, He graduated from
Yale University in 1939 with a
a, A. in history. After mar-
riage and service in World War
ll as an Air Force pilot, he
returned to Yale and received
a law degree in 1946. As a
young businessman he built up
a reputation as a trouble shoot-
er for ailing industries. For 13
years he served on every level
of local activity,

Then in 1060 he was elected
to the U. S. Congress from
Pennsylvania's 10th District by
16,915 votes, while Presiden—
tial candidate Kennedy won the
same district by 14,963. In 1982
Scranton was elected governor
over Richard Dillworth — for
whom Kennedy campaigned—
by 486,000 votes. The Demo»
'crats had a 210,000 registration
lead in the state at the time.
In both elections, Scranton was
drafted by the party leader-
ship. Even though he main<
tains a detached attitude to-
ward politics, he has shown
himself to be a superb combat
commander. He is fascinated
by politics and once committed
to action or a race, becomes a
tactful, progressive leader. He
believes that duty, not politics,
beckons him and this gives him
the enviable position of self-
confidence; Scranton's person-
ality is something special. He
has an easy manner with pea»
ple, yet manages to remain
what he is, an aristocrat of
wealth and parts.

Scranton has expressed his
views on a variety of current
issues,

CIVIL RIGHTS: Approves of
the objectives of the civil rights
bill before Congress. Believes
the Federal Government should
take positive action on public
accommodations.

BUDGET: He is a balanced
budget man and doesn’t believe
in deficit spending He is not a
Keynesian theorist.

MEDICARE: Feels a need
for additional federal legislab
tion, but opposes medicare fi-
nanced by Social Security de-
ductions, Proposes financing
health care out of general tax
revenues.

FOREIGN AID: Supports for-
eign aid but is war 'ed about
Latin American distribution
Thinks the US should be able
to cut down on foreign aid
since there is an enormous
backlog in accumulated appro-
priations.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Feels
that the U. S, must have a
strong foreign policy, When-
ever Communists threaten the
free world, a strong stand must
be taken, even though there
may be danger.

William Scranton is a man
with the earmarks of a great
President. Neither lust for pow»
er, entrancement with leader-
ship or an inner self—doubt stirs
this governor's mind as much

 

as the nature of duty. He be-

tions, that convinced the late
John F. Kennedy to name
Lodge ambassador to South
Viet Nam in June of 1963. Dur~
ing his tenure in Viet Nam,
Lodge has managed to make
himself more than the hoped-
for non-Democratic buffer be-
tween the Administration’s
Southeast Asian policy and the
forthcoming election. In fact, he
has not let political considera-
tions interfere witll pushing
American efforts, He has shown
skill and toughness in exercis-
ing a co-ordinating hand over a
15,000 man U. S. military mis-
sion and heavily staffed Central
Intelligence Agency. w h i c h
tended to work at cross pur-
poses with each other and the
State Department under prev~
ious ambassadors,

His position on United States
policy is this: stand up or get
out. Yet standing up, for
Lodge, does not necessarily
carry with it an appeal to
arms, Rather. to stand up is to
fight inaction. “It is not enough
for us to be so strong that the
Communist countries are afraid
to attack us or encroach furth-
er on the rest of the world.
We are already strong enough
for that. We must do more; we
must lead the world to a last-

lieves in public, not pol lcal
office,

As a possible Presidential
candidate William Scranton has
a poWerful factor on his side—
his potent ability to unite the
Warring Republican P a r t y.
Among the middle of the road
Republicans there is an active
enthusiasm while right wing—
ers feel no hostility, Scranton's
unblemished record as a lead—
and a vote-getter is an indica-
tion of his ability to lead the
Republican Party to a victory
in 1964,

 

ing peace where true disarma-
ment will be possible.” Clearly
Lodge is most capable in the
area of international relations.

While Lodge's popular ap-
peal has been based largely up-
on his diplomatic ability, he
has not been one to neglect the
internal affairs of the nation,
As a senator, he was far less
hostile than most Republicans
to the New Deal, and he went
on record for the Wagner Act,
the Wages and Hours Act, and
in 1939 he sought to amend the
Social Security Act to increase
old age payments. His support
of the New Deal programs
along with his opposition to the
industry-wide. compulsory bar-
gaining clause of the Taft-
Hartley Act has made labor
more than usually receptive to
a Republican candidate, al-
though his official record on
labor problems ends in 1952
with his appointment to_the
UN.

Lodge has not been a John—
ny-come-lately to the questions
and problems of racial segre»
gation. In 1950, in an article
for the Atlantic Monthly,
Lodge proposed to end racial
segregation in the armed
forces and in housing projects
and educational projects fi-
nanced by the Federal gov-
ernment. In addition to numer-
ous statements made during
the 1960 campaign stressing

the need for a strong civil rights
platform, Lodge made known
his desire to include a qualified
Negro in the cabinet. should the
Republicans be elected.

Lodge, in a speech made at
the end of his 1960 campaign
indicated support for an active
federal role. He said, “We can
overcome the prejudice and de<
iects in understanding which
still stand between some of our
citizens and full opportunity.
We can provide the schools,
the medical care, the hospitals,
where these are needed.”

His awareness of pressing
constitutional issues has been
in the forefront, In 1950 he co-
sponsored the Lodge-Basset
Amendment, passed by the
Senate but turned down by the
House, which sought to do
away with the “antiquated"
electoral college.

In short, the aura of experi-
ence which has surrounded
Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., has
created a tradition of ability
both in diplomacy and in=poll--
tics, a tradition which won him
the support of Republicans in
New Hampshire.
