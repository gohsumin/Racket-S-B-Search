Weekend Fare:
Winter Setting

Coi'nfed
unite!

The chains of the academic pro-
letariat will be thrown off this
weekend as Grinnellians make a
stab at a full-fledged social life
with North Campus weekend. Male
propagandizing will resume after
a briet lapse during Women’s
Weekend, with open dorms, a rock
’n roll dance and a Snow Queen
adding a dash of decadent capi»
talism to the festivities Saturday
night.

“Annapurna; Ski New Here
izons” will be the feature fare in
ARI-l at 9:00 Friday nightt Com-
petition between halls, will be held
Saturday afternoon in broom hock-
cy (co-ed teams on Barber Plaza
without skates), dog sledding, and
snow sculpture (a Michelangelo
with a snowball affair). The apple-
cheeked, healthy, young luwan ate
mosphere will prevail and contin-
ue Saturday night when Grinnell
meets Augustana lil basketball at
7:30 and with open swimming Sun-
day afternoon. “Seven Brides for
Seven Brothers" will either be the
perfect ending to a perfect week»
end or will prowde the last straw
Sunday night at 7:30.

Broom hockey, anyone?

Students

Grinnell upperclassmen found
the going rough at tile end of the
semester, but on the whole preter-
red ending the fall semester
before Christmas vacation, a re-
cent survey by the 5&3 revealed.

Of the 250 survey forms re-
turned. 69.5 per cent favored the
new semester exam schedule,
with an additional 5.25 per cent
iavoring the early exams. but a
shortened Christmas vacation.
Some suggested a longer mid«
term break in the tall and more
breathing space at the end of the
semester for written work and ex-
am preparation. Only 18 per cent
advocated a return to the old sys-
tem, with exams following Christe
mas vacation. Seven and a quar-
ter per cent indicated indifference
on the questionnaire.

Pressure Greater

Comparing last fall with pre-
Vious fall semesters at Gi‘inilell, 41
per cent indicated that they found
the pressures on them toward the
end much greater. Another 31 per
cent said the pressures seemed
slightly greater. Twenty per cent
of the Students found end-of-the
semester pressures unchanged,

 

while only 3 per cent indicated
that they seemed less than usual.

The lengthy Christmas break pro-
vided 60 per cent of those ques-
tioned to do more unrequited
reading than during previous va-
cations. Twentyrsix per cent said
they did the same amount of un-
required reading, while 14 per
cent indicated less. A number of
students in these two categories
indicated that they were seniors
who spent the time studying for
comps.

Work Load Up

Fifyrsix and a half per cent of
the students said their work load
increased this semester, 37.5 per

cent tnund lt unchanged and 6
per cent found it lighter. They
rated their own performance as im-
proved in 42 per cent at the cases,
unchanged in 33 per cent, and de-
clined in 25 per cent.

Starting school on Labor Day
caused major inconveniences to 12
per cent of those questioned. On
the other hand, a few students
and faculty members suggested
starting the semester late in Au-
gust to aViid such tight finals
scheduling.

Students rated their unrequired
reading during last semester as
more, is per cent; less, 31 per
cent; and the same, 53 per cent.
Many of the students who indicat-

Quality Unchanged

The change in semester schedui-

Move to Abolish Student Senate
Progresses in Wednesday Session

By LIBBY PANNWITF

Wednesday night, after a week
ot deliberating on the subject of
reorganizing the present student
government system. the Student
senate came to a vote of 1277 in
favor of putting the proposed
changes into amendment form.

As it stood last week, the major
changes involved tlle abolishment
of the Senate, and the establish
ment of a Council of House Pres-
idents by combining the AWS
Board and the Coil-1P.

SGA President Jerry Goddard
opened the evening’s discussion to
general questioning from the sen-
ators and members of the commit-
tee iormed last week to draft the
iinal proposal,

The discussion covered the fol-
lowing general areas:

1) Will the proposed system en-
courage enough participation of
students not actively involved in
SSA?

2) At present the administration
doesn't discuss its actions enough
with the Senate. This is not the
fault of the Senate and Should not
be used as a point of criticism.

3) Will the coordination of the
AWS Board and the CofHP be a
more efficient system and Still
representative of the students?

4) Karen Lauterbach said those
in favor of abolishing the Senate
were those who were never active
in the Senate, and that the Senate
was effective as a political train-
ing ground and accomplished a
great deal.

5) in the past the Senate has
been given more of a chance to
be an effective part of the student
government, some senators said.
This year it has not been given
the chance and has been Worked
around in general, these senators
contended.

“The important thing," Goddard
Said, “is what each [if uS consid-
ers student government to be. I
think that the SGA functions to do
a job—to govern eiiectively and
also to talk with college officials.”

Chris Peterson, AWS Board
President, said, “Any system you
haveethe Senate or the new pro<
posed system—depends a lot on
personalities involved. It‘s only

Poverty Speeches in Des Moines

Seen As Pioiett

By DAVE DILLON

“I see no reason whatsoever
why students cannot and should
not be involved in community af-
fairs, anymore than 1 can under—
stand why more universities and
colleges are not more actively in-
volved in the community from
which they draw their money and
in which they participate to a
great extent. . .1 think this is a
university and a college responsi-
bility,” This was the response of
Office of Economic Opportunity

Walter Valverde to a question
about student work in social ac—

Other leaders of the ”Governor's

Liberian Positions
Offered to Grads

Seniors are eligible for two-year
appointments beginning in July
1955 as Graduate Assistants at
Cuttington College in Liberia. This
opportunity is made possible by a
program of cooperation and ex-
change between the Associated
Colleges of the Midwest and Cut-
tington College.

The ACM - Cuttington program
was begun in 1963, Dirk Baay
(German) was one or the first
ACM faculty members to teach at
Cuttington, He is now the Grim
nelt member of the Cuttington Col-
lege Committee; applications and
information may be obtained from
him.

The Cuttington program offers
a unique opportunity for partici-
pation in the development of lib-
eral education in Africa. The stu-
dent body of 200 represents about
one-third of the enrollment in
higher education in Liberia.

Gredit-Fails

Blasts Logic of Editorial ,

To the Editor:

The editor last week accused
the newly adopted credit-fail pro»
posal or being a “half-way” meas-
ure and implied that a couiplete
pass~fail system would have been
preicrable. 1 disagree,

There are several cogent objec-
tions to a complete passsfail sys
tem. For one thing, oi itselt, a
complete passsfail system tails to
provide a means tor distinguish-
ing excellence and makes selfras~
sessment ot performance on the
part ot the student diiticult, it
not impossible. in sure many
Grinnell students would find the
complete removal ot all measures
of relative achievement to be 0177
iectiooable. in addition, students'
grade points are a mayor consid-
eration ct employers and gradu-
ate schools. To abolish them com-
pletely might seriously hamper
the chances oi a Grinnell graduate
obtaining employment or admis-
sion to graduate study according
to his or her merits

Perhaps someday it will be post
lible to eliminate letter grades
completely and to replace them
with a system of short, individual
essays oi evaluation and with let
ters or recommendation suiticient-
ly influential with graduate
schools as to insure our students’
acceptance at merimd places or
study. Until the time when such
a system can he successfully in-
stituted at Grinnell, or at any li
eral arts college tor that matter
I see no alternative to the reten-
tion oi a system of letter grades,
at least in part. :

However, while i feel that a to» '
tal pass~fail system would be both
unicasible and undesirable tor
Grinnell now and in the foresee»
able future, 1 also believe that
there are limitations inherent inl
a grading system based complete-f
ly on letter grades oi sufficient'
import to justify the laculty's‘
adopiion of the limited, voluntary,
one course per semester “credit-
iail" measure. Within particular
courses the stress on grades too
otten encourages students to work
for the wrong reasons or in tlicl
wrong manner. The emphasis is
placed on the grade achieved
rather than on the knowledgei
gained or the intellectual skills‘
developed. The importance at-l
taclicd both at (rl'innell and aitcr‘;
Grillnell to a single number. lhe‘
cumulative grade point, relleclingi
grades in courses that vary cont
snlcrahly in signiticancc and in'
difﬁculty, can lend to grave dis

es and to the punishment o

i intellectually adventurous.‘
This cmpliasis on the cumulati c
grade point has frequently led stu: l
dents to select courses in whichi
they can get the best grades iath- l
er than those best suited to tliei
educational needs or most satis

‘ ' g to their intellectual curios

ll-

lsy removing this emphasis oi

gra s to a limited extent. the
faculty has permitted the studentsi,
greater trccdoui or choice in thei

NY—

selection oi courses. At the same
time, by retaining letter grades in
part, or entirely if the student so
desires, the taculty has provided
both the students and themselves
with adequate means to gauge the
individuals overall academic prog»
ms and has insured that Grinnell
students will not be illrlrented at
the hands of graduate schools and
employers.

As to the rest at last week's
editorial, I shall only comment
brietly, though probably more
than it deserves. Perhaps some
students will let their work slide
in their elected pass-fail course.
Not a tew let work slide in one
or more courses now Still, it the
student is properly motivated and
has elected to study a subject
which intrigues him, 1 see no
reason to tear “sloppy, halfrway
work.” The average semester
workload is well within the capac-
ity oi almost all Grinnell students.
it the student is insutticiently mo
tivatcd, whether he takes a course
on a “creditrfail” basis or not will
make little ditterence.

The logic of the editorial as a
whole appears to me to be inju-
dicious as well as unsound. The
rather peculiar position taken by
the editor was hardly calculated
to cioate the impression ot a ma.
ture student body among an al-
ready skeptical taculty and admin»
istration.

Kirsehner Reveals Disenclmntment
Wit/l Facts of Grinnell Existence

To the Editor:

Over in past tew years i have
become v y adept at browsing
through college catalogs and try-
ing to siphon out those institu—
tions at which i would he hap»
piest in this, my treshman, year.
Among the many bulletins and
handbooks i read was one in par
ticular which i would like to
quote at some length, because it
embodies everything i always
droamcd of in a college:

“The policy at [this college] is
to impose as tew rules as possible.
Our students are considered to be
responsible adults and are treated
in this manner.

“The college will interfere as
little as possible in the personal
lives ot students, but all members
at the college community are ex.
pected to maintain its excellent
reputation, civic as well as acar
demic. both on and oi: the caur
pus."

"ltesidcnce of students in col»
logo is needed to create a sense
of community to emancipate litu~
dents irorn adolescent interests,
to free them iroin prejudices. to
foster independence, and to pro
vidc new experiences. persper
tives, and aspirations."

“In such an [independent] at-
mosphere all members oi the com-
munity have the opportunityiand
the responsibility * to test the
merit of ideas in the light oi
ll'uth. assured of I'Especi for their
honest inquiry irom all other
members of the community."

I went on to read the objective:
at the college: _

"[This college] exists tor the
purpose oi shaping the character
oi each ot its students 7 to make
each student a ditiorent and a
better human being.” ~

Does anyone recognize this

haven of intellectual and personal
liberty? I don't blame you, fellow
Pioneers, but I would like to point
out that the aforementioned se-
lections come from the Grinnell
College Bulletin, and the Student
Handbook, 196566.

The atmosphere that pervades
this campus is one oi general dis~
trust by the administration toward
the students. The only reason this
attitude is allowed, possibly even
encouraged, to exist is that the
corresponding attitude of the slur
dents here is one of extreme
apathy. is it that Grinnellions
would rather switch than iight »
that is, stibiugate their personal
goals to the apparently over-rid
ing authority ot the administra»
tion — or is it that the college's
“excellent reputation, civic as
well as academic” attracts a cer—
tain caliber oi person __ perhaps
a superior student. but a medi»
one individual? However, all is
not lost, it only the administra-
tion would assume that perhaps
the student is not too far gone ior
salvation and that it is the admin»
isirction's duty to take the tirst
steps

Onl- College rorum was recent-
ly cited in two magazines as a
landmark in the correlation be»
tween architectural design and
iunction. In College and Univer~
sity business, Merritt c. Ludwig,
Vice-Fresidem ot Grinnell,
stressed that the design is condu-
cive to iniormal activity. Mr. Lud<
wig wrote, .. . a prime consid-
eration in design was to achieve a
place that would be especially
hospitable to good conversa-
tion . . I have not as yet found
any areas for “good conversation"
in the Forum. The television room
(labeled “Parlor“ on the iloor

plan) permits of no “good conv
versation" and is obviously used
tor what its colloquial name sug
gests, it it can be heard at all
above the din oi the adiaccnt
juke box.

Skipping the Grill for the mo-
ment. we tind ourselves in the
South Lounge. It looks harmless
enough: grand piano, comiortable.
looking chairs and hassccks, and
a plush carpet _ all conducive
to intoimal talk and relaxation.
But. Heaven help the misguided
soul who thinks that the piano is
there to be played, or that the
loungeseﬂeet is to encourage con.
versation. because anyone who
talks above a whisper or so much
as plays an arpeggio is booed out
by the people who have taken
over the South Lounge as a study
center.

Oddly enough, it is in the Music
Listening hoom that one may talk
in peace, where everyone is on
livious ot respect tor the _music
and for the people attempting to
inltill the supposed tunotion of
the room. Beethoven would prob.
ably do more than roll over in his
grave it he thought that he had
written music to talk by. .

Getting back to the Griu, it is
the area that comes closest to ful-
tilling the great need at this col»
lege tor a place to gather and
talk, but even it is far trom per.
leot. My idea 01 a place to relax
and meet with my ii-iends is not
a restaurant. sutticc it to say.

North Campus

To the Editor:

Sue Taylor’s article, “Leggett

the January 21 issue of 8&3 is
evidence of the continued serious
thought being given the “North
Campus Problem” by President
Leggett and others. The residence
hall system, says Dr. Leggett,
"ought to be flexible enough to
provide for various kinds of slu~
dents " Agreed. However. it seems
that by the time any male reaches
senior status he has iallen into
one of two “distinct kinds," those
"seriously interested in prepar-
iiig tor graduate school and those
who are devoted to the residence
hall system " I can’t tail to be just
a little skeptical, (i know a few
seniors ntysell).

need only put all those seniors,
“seriously preparing tor graduate,

“who are devoted to the residence

lecturer. Monday night Nolllng
spoke in Souih Lounge in slu-
denls and inculty members on
“New Horizons and Challenges in
Urban Development.”

Nolling discussed lhe major eco-
nomic and social changes taking
place in the country today and
spoke of government attempts to
set up regional economic districts.
He also emphasized the increasing
importance at and necessuy for
more city managerial systems in
cope with problems arising in ur-
baii aliairs,

One of [hesa problems concerns
the outgrowth oi suburban areas
from the major cities. By 1980 it
is predicied that the suburbs will
have 60 million more people than
the city proper,

”in the past twenty years,"
Noliing said, “suburbs have
grown forty times as fast as the
central cities. Today many subur-
banites work in the suburbs rath-
er than in the central city.”

The increasing n u m b e r of
younger iamilies living in the sub
urban areas have given support on

 

city manager systems, because

lhese people “are more ready in

arises since the major cities be-
come hemmed in by the other in-
corporated cities and can’t expand
because of them. “The suburbs
don’t want to give up their gov-
ernment and become part of the
bigger clues," Nolling said,

He stated ihal there is an in-
creasing role at the federal gov-
ernment In city chairs {a decrease
the amount oi “local autonomy.”
In the lield of cultural activities,
for example, the trend is “more
and more toward _help from the
government in local aclivilies in
planning and ﬁnances.”

Several plansare being consid-
ered to deal with the various llr<
ban diiiicullies according to Nolt<
ing. The ﬁrst plan is to slrihc a
balance between the local and fed-
eral governments by turning parl-
nerships. Next. there should be

Third, the existing conli'ols should

Tive Grinnellians Sent To teMoyne;
xcllange Brings Four From Memphis

 

AI LeMoyne . . .

o
This semester marks the fourth

that the student exchange pro-
gram between Grinnell and Les
Hoyne College in Memphis, Ten-
nessee, has been in existence.
Since its inception in September,
£64, nine students from Gi'innell
and eight from LeMoyne have
taken advantage of the program

&The ﬁve Grinnellians at Le-
Moyne this semester are‘ Richard
Lance, a junior; Amy Rossman,
.sophomore; Janet Poland, a soph-
omore; Linda Thomas, a sopho-
more; and Pat Stern, a junior.

. Registration for the semester
uegan yesterday and will be cons
eluded today. classes will begin
Monday, the (list, and will end the
ﬂast week of May

The tour girls are living in the
Cottage, a girls on-campus dorm.
ﬁance has inherited the elf—cam-
pus apartment vacated by Myron
Lowry, one of the LeMoyne stu-
.dents spending the semester here.

Although it is generally some—
what warmer in Memphis than it
,is in iowa, freezing Grinnellians
needn’t be envious. The arriving
students were greeted at LeMoyne
by four inches of snow and sub-
Ireezing temperatures. which,
though perhaps not a welcome
sight, must have certainly been a
,tamillar one,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Havord Bishop

Anita Curry

- AI Grinnell . . .

Four LeMoyne students arrived
at Grinnell Tuesday, January 18.
They are Havord Bishop, Myron
Lowry, Barbara Jo Wilson, and
Anita Curry.

Bishop, a junior biology major,
is living in Smith. Bishop says he
finds Grinnell very different so-

crally from LeMoyne. The Mem-
phis school, he says, has only about
half Grinnell's enrollment, 'and
they all come from the same area.

a. Bishop sees advantages and draw-

backs to Grinnell’s size and the
wide diiierenees among its stu-
dents. “At LeMuyne the students
otten come to have closer rela-
tionships,” he says.

Lowry is a sociology major. He
is a sophomore and will spend his
Grinnell semester in East Norris.

Also a sociology major is sopho-
more Miss Curry. She and Miss
Wilson, a chemistry major, both
live in Loose. This is the first dor-
mitoiy experience for the two
girls and both find it “marvee
loils."

“I wouldn't trade dul'm life for
anything in the world!" Miss Wil-
Son commented,

Adjusting to the climate was a
trick for the Southerners. “At
first it was unbearable, but I seem

to have been able to adapt," Bis-
hop said. Mill Wilson added “The

 

people are so warm that I can’t
detect the coldness.”

the history of the draft, the record
of Amherst students ‘in the mili-
tary, the students' willingness to
serve, and how to get out of the
draft. .

Approximately two-thirds of the
students ielt “a personal obliga-
tion to serve the country in either
the armed iorces or through such
alter-natives as the Peace Corps.”
Many others commented that “I
ieel an obligation to humanity, but
not just to this ‘holy Country’ l’,
or “I feel I could be of more use
Outside of institutionalized alters
natives.” But 92 per cent indicat—
ed a willingness to serve it it were
absolutely necessary.

The attitudes of Amherst men
towards the draft varied from the
Nathan Hale concept of patriotism
to the paciiist attitude. or those
polled who were in favor or serv-
ing the country were also plan-
ning to avoid this draft for as
long as possible. Eighty-five per-
cent were plonning on graduate
school. Views expressed in this re-
gard were: “I was planning to
talte two years off and bum
around, but now I’ll have to go
to grad school," “There are a lot
of unemployed people who could
iulfill my draft requirements,"
and ”I don‘t Want to‘serve, but
it dralted, going to jail would not
be in the interests of my career."

About eight per cent at Amherst
students were contemplating eith-
er non » cooperation or conscien-
tious objection. This was about a

A major point of discussion

points.

The Pioneers kept the game
close {or the ﬁrst eight minutes
but were outscored 32-18 in the
last twelve minutes to take a fif-

Although Luther substituted fre-
uuently after Intermission. the
Pioneers were never able to close
the gap.

Coach Piltsch was particularly
unhappy about the Pioneer do
iense. With the Pioneer offense
starting to roll into gear, Plitsch
feels the team can pull some sur-
prises if the defense jells.
