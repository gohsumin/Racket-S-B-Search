The court of public oblivion

Last month, Gus Hall and Benjamin Da\ . top Ameri—
can communists were indicted and sentenced for failing to
make the iequii‘ed registration of their party under the
1950 Subversive Activities Control Act. Jailing‘ communists
is» no novelty in this era, but every time the justice de~

artment singles out part members for exemplary pun—

nient civil libertai ans use disturbing questions.

Although the Supreme court last June upheld the 1950
legislation by a majo ty of one, attorney John Abt is still
actively pressing the party’s court case. The ai 'ument rims
somthing' like this. If party members register under the
1950 Act, they subject themselves to prosecution llnder the
Smith Act (1940) as advocates of “the violent overthrow
of the government.”

In effect. the melnber is forced by law to testify a-
gainst himself (Fifth Amendment). The high court will
probably have another go at this appeal, but the broader
qlies n of free speech guaranteed b_ the first amend-
ment is involved in the whole network of anti—Red leg-
islation.

Professor David Shannon’s assessment of the party
as “the willing instrument of the Soviet Union” is quite
true. especially since a mass exodus of moderates from the
[arty after the Hung rian r iolution left only a “hard
core” of wornrout militants. Those who defend oppressive
measures against these left-overs feel no enemy “line”
should be allowed to contaminate the air of public life.

The days of a sweeping and absolute attitude toward
~"il libeiies are over, it appears There are circum-
stances in which a “fifth column" or a communist party
might constitute “a clear and present danger," but that
time is not now. John Stuart Mill's conception of liberty
' an ideal that antedates the rapid and brutal coup (l‘etat
(it the Twentieth century. The ideal must be approximated
rs closely as possible but should also correspond to political
leality.

The “New Yorker" cartoon showing a communist
addressingia party meeting with the remark. “Dear
Comrades and the FBI," correctly gauges the impotence
of the present party (membership estimated by Shannon
at 3000). Thi. is the kind of circumstance that should
lead to legal ins; the party, not destroying it.

Strategic infiltration has been security-checked out
of existence, and police laws are quite able to handle saber
tzlge. All the Communists can do is talk softly in a country
which is quite unreceptive to their message. Overt acts can
undermine America's national existence but the “Worker”
or the public rostrum of Archie Brown cannot. 11‘ these
tiny Communist “advocacies” become open acts of sedition,
which looks rather unlikely, the party should lose its liber-
ties but not until then The distance between “talk and
"act” here is more than semantic; it is the historic ground
between democracy and totalitarian supre . on of thought.

01' all the Western democracies the U. 5. alone has
seen fit to outlaw the party, evidence of a hysteria that
blinds us to the reali ies of American communism. In
some countries. Italy for example, there has been a pro
gressive evolution witllin the party itself, a relaxing of the
Moscow party line, and the development of a ”grey flail-
nel” communism capable of governing its provincial strong:
holds in the Western democratic tradition,

We allow the “Nazi" George Rockwell to organize and
deploy his station-wagon storm troopers but deny legality
to a party whose voice is small, political opportunities lime
ited and espionage potential slim. The time and circum-
stances seem right for a pragmatic revival of J. S. Mill. As
tor the recent arrests ill have to agree for perhaps the
first and last time with old rabble—rouser, Gus Hall, “I’m
agin it."

Thc major portion or the coii~

sion incclings where small groups
of students debated and decided

planning conlmillee in the State
Department might do in the
spemﬁc proposals that lhesc
commissions ﬁnally agreed upon,

philosophy and policy that was
indicative of most of_ the stu~
dents at the conference. and
pr ‘bably also of the great ina-
10 13’ 0f students on most of
their home campuses.

A: the outset, most or the
commissions felt that the goals
cf the United States were to
promote our own national interr
esl and sciluprcscrvalion, and to
preserve the American way of
life. hopefully without war, but
at the expense nl peace is nec-
essary. This statement of basic
goals gives the basis on which
most of the students felt we
should approach our relations
\\'ltl‘i the Communist bloc These
goals Commit the United

policy, given the state of ten-
sion in the world today and the
obvious desire on the part oi
Russia to promote her own self-

should iun cxciudc negoti

coiilei-eiice icll that there was
not a very great probability
liiiil anything meaningful could
be reached in such negotiae
tions at lhc present. stage).
The United states should use
its nuclear strength to back
up our diplcmclic strategy

weapons ii we nrc threatened
by Soviet aggression,

The conierence was not gen-
erally in ltz‘lvor or pi- emptive
war, although the majority of
the commission that I was on
felt that -we should covertly
support guerilla movements in
Communistrcontrolled countries.
and overtly support them if
they represent llic feeling
the people oi that counli
are about to win in open revo»
lution. This was the most mili-
larislic and aggressi c statement
made by any group at the cone
lei’cncc. however, Wlost of the
statements made by [he Commis-
sions did reflect a very power
politics-oriented approach to for
eign policy. The students felt
that there were values more im-
portant to the United States than
peace at any price, and even
more important than life itself.

It‘ is my iudgmenl that these
views represent the opinions of

students today,

take any unilateral cclion with-

not endangered, The old prob-
lems at inspection and control
winch have plagued every ale
tcmpt at negotiations in the last
ten years.do not seem much
closer to solution today.

The students at the confer
ence are willing to risk the pos-
sibility (and who can accurate
ly Judge the probability) of ntlr
clear ‘war in order to preserve
the ideals and way of life of
the United States. They feel
that only when there is some

Hanson siaies
IRC presidency
platform planks

by Gary Hanson

As a candidate for President
of the international Relations
Club, 1 have formulated the fair
lowing proposals concerning its
activities:

1. A parallel to study grcups’
could be Saturday atternoon dis
cussion groups of student and
faculty members, meeting twice
a month to explore events and
issues in world affairs, These
groups should the or a sponta-
neous nature, rather than pr
pared debates and discussions.

2. IRC should plan farther in
advance to contact well known
speakers.

3. IRC’s program for next fall
should the planned this spring,
as September is too late to line
up speakers and begin the
groundwork on a conference.

4. Study groups should rpc
used more as temporary organis
zations to cover arcas leading
up to a major coniercnce. ‘

5. Greater use can he made
of the large membership in IRC.
to draw in diverse talents to
aid the international relations
program at Grinnell,

My previous experience in In~
[emotional Affairs at Grinncll
have been state Collegiate Coun-
cil of the United Nations chair-
man and UN director. .

With Iowa drying out from the zlmiuzil spring floods,
Midwest Conference busebilll M‘ﬂl‘ns llzll'e for the most plirt
lSWllll‘gj into action. The Conference, which is divided into
I \\'o five—team divisions for baseball, should be well balanced
l\\'ll.ll the defending cllzlmpion, Cce, getting stern competi-
itioii from Grinncll and Monmouth ill the southern division.

In the llorthcln tllvi ion St. Olaf zmd Ripon le'e cor
lfui rites to win the d son title. The \iiniicrs in each
idirlsion will meet in a Lil'o-otlt-olltlil'cc playoff for the
league title May 18-19 on the dizlmond of the nothcrn di-
vision champ.

 

l The northern division includes Minnesota zllid Wisccn-
'n members of the Conference, while the southern diViSion
iis comprised of the Iowa and Illinois Conference members.

g In the southern division, which is of iinlncdlnle inter-
;est to Grinnell, Coe has only four lcttci’lneli returning from
llzlsi. year‘s championship squad. Coach Bill Fitch‘s only res
iturning pitcher is Mike Gibney. His other Veterans are
‘ a Tliiele, first; Ron Kozenicz‘dli, second; and Frazer
iWi’ig‘ht, outfield.

. Cornell has a severe talent problem which has caused its
lcoach, Paul Maashe, to quip, ”We're hoping for ram on
lthe eight days we have games scheduled."

‘ Knox, on the other hand, could surprise the Midwest
Conference this year. The Siwash squad, which finished in
in second-place tie ill the southern division last season,
boasts seven returning letter-men along with soph Souths
paw, Bob Peters; Peters should give added depth to the
[Silvaslh who already have Tom Bicc uncl Al Knight on the
lfii'ing' line. Also, catcher Bob Kucik will be in his third

'season as a regular.

Monmouth, which lost; its opening game to Coe, ltlso
is rated as a top challenger. Led by junior pitcher Gene
Dawson, who tossed two shut-cuts last season, the Scots
iwill go with seven other lettermen.

i
And for Gi'inncll everything is ”go." Couch Edd Bow-
ers inherits a squad from John Pfitscli (on leave in Pali-
amzl) that includes lust year’s number one pitcher, Dick
Mitllebusher; outfielder, Bob McIntyre, who hit .407 and
second sucker, Dale Furnish, who hit at a .374 clip.

' Versatile Cris Sprung is another that Bowers will
COlllli. heavily on. In the past, Sprung has caught, plziycd
the infield and pitched in relief, running up 2i 2-0 mark
last year Other returnees include captain and catcher,
‘Rogcr iller; shortstop, Al-t Peterson and outfielder
Bruce Bell.

Two sophomores should also play a big role in Grin-
'nell’s title hopes. One, Cal Collier, is a hllrler and fl st
baseman, while the other is Jim Jenks, zl third sucker.

Because of Grinnell’s balance and pitching, I’ll pick them
as the team to bent in the southern division rating Coe
second, Monmouth third, Knox fourth and Come“ last.

Animal Life

by Len Caloduey
(Sports Co»edittir)

With all the emph'asis placed on winning, it is n won-
der that no one has yet complained that the purpose of
the intramural program at Grinnell is being destroyed
For. as Mr. John C. Trucsdole (physical education), director-
of IM athletics says, “it is designed for all those boys not
in intercollegiate athletics who are physically able to par»
ticipate."

We do realize that each hall has a natural desire to
win, but this certainly does not arouse the fact that the
spirit of HTS is stiffled in the maJOi spring sport, softball.

In each of the other major sports, football, volleyball
and basketball, a simple method of free substitution is in

effect, enabling any hall to allow as many boys as they‘

wish to parti pate in each contest. Granted, this is more
difficult to arrange in a sport played like softball, but at
least and attempt at a solution should be made. Unfortunate-
ly, as it stands now, softball is virtually a teneinan sport.

John Husted, 1M chairman of Cowles, has devised a
sensible, limited substitution plan that could easily be in-
corporated into the softball rules. However, to hear some
of the other 1M chairmen talk, one would think that they
were managers of professional teams who would lose their
jobs if their team lost too many games, especially if the
losses were to the second string players of other hulls who
would be given the opportunity to participate that they
would otherwise not have under the present rules.

By Husted's plan, five or six athletes would be
designated as special substitutes “110 would be able to
repl a starter once. The starter could return to the
‘gnm‘e t a future time. this happening only once. The still
would have to play at least one full inning. When the
starter returned to the game, he would go back to his

ml spot in the batting under to prevent unfair
stacking of teams in late innings. Of course, additional
substitutes could replace other starters who could not re-
turn to the game as is the case now.

Only two objections were voiced to the pin The first
was it fear that scoring would become too complicated, but
this problem would be minimized because the new rule
“ould involve limited substitution.

The second obiection was that the plan 'did not follow
the normal rules of baseball. This logic is completely
invalid because there is no reason why we at Grinnell must
allow it rule ncccs y to the profs. ioniil sport to inter-
fere with our effort to make the 1M program what it
should be, open to all. .

Because it will broaden IM’s, Trucsdalc favors the
change in the softball rules, and hopes that a solution
. to the scoring problem will be worked out.
