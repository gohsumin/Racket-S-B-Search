department bear direct relation to and
will have a significant effect upon the
Ontire college community.

Recognition of tlie eminence, as well
as the imminence. of those effects has
aroused considerable studentrfaculty in<
wrest in the facts and issues involved in
these theatre developments. A decided
lack of clarity and consistency in the
Bommunication of said facts and issues.
however, has resulted in markedly Corr
Med impressions of the entire situation.

Controversies have arisen from the
contradictory natures of the following
reported facts: 1.) that Meyer did him-
self, or his own volition, resign, yet ex-
pressed, as well as firm conviction, an
admittedly unhappy reluctance to do so;
2.) that administrative officials respond-
ed with frank regret to their acceptance
oi Meyer’s resignation, yet had admitted-
ly neither invited nor expressly encours
aged him to continue as director of
theatre; 3.) that Meyer's withdrawal of
his application ior director — and also
his eventual resignation —- appear to
have been inseparably related to his oc-
cupation of an unavoidably awkward po-
sition as principal interviewer of all oth-
er candidates — and, therefore. of his
own competitors —« for the directorship
appointment.

It has since proven relatively impos-
lible for The Reporter to ascertain com-
plats explanations for, or to acquire sat-
isiactory Clarifications of these ques-

E oven faculty members to lea e

Eleven Grinnell faculty members will
be quitting their posts at the end oi
this year. They are Thomas H. Charl-
ton (anthropology), Kenyon Knopf (econ-
omics), Oliver Luther (Spanish), Richard
Meyer (theatre), Mario E. Ruiz (Sloane
15h), Thomas Somerville (speech and
theatre), David A. Sutherland (music),
Miss Edith A Sternield (arr), Bruce R.
Thomas (physics), and Marion G. Van-
fossen (sociology). Ned D o n a h o a
(speech and dream), now on leave of
absence, tentatively will not return to
Grinnell.

Bruce Thomas

Bruce Thomas, Assistant Professor of
Physics since September, 1965, is leav-
ing Grinnell after this semester to take
I teaching post at Carleton.

Thomas, whose primary interest is
elementary particles, hasn't been able
to do research here due to lack of
time and Grinnell's isolation. A! Carle<
too, he explained, his lighter classioad
(one class per trlmester) and the in-
terests represented in Carleton's physics
department will allow him more oppor-
tunity for independent work.

Thomas expressed no great dissafis
faction with Grinncll as compared to
Carleton. “The basic commitments of
the two schools are very similar and
they're facing the same problems -—-
problems of student culture, curriculum,
and educational philosophy," he ex.
plained.

Regarding the special problems con—
fronting undergraduate science curricula
and students, Thomas said, "The status
of a science major at a liberal arts
school is under review because the
amount of major-ﬁeld instruction needed

to compete with the universities fill!
the students' time.” He attributed tho
necessity for a heavy course load to
the rapid rate of scientific development.
Citing solid-state physics as an example,
he noted that fifteen years ago it was!
a relatively minor ﬁeld; now, a largo
percentage of physics research mane]
is channeled into solid-slate work,

A 1980 Grinnell graduate, Thomul
earned his doctorate at Comell Univer-
sit .

y David A. Sutherland

David A, Sutherland (music) hﬂl
resigned, due to a change in the dines
tion of his career which will requlm
post-graduate work. Presently is musl-
colngist, he plans to enter the fleld ol
ethnomusicology.

When asked to comment on student
life, Sutherland stated that although he
has experienced some student irresponsi-
bility and realizes that all institution
must act in a considerate manner to-
ward the society oi which it is a part,
he nevertheless takes what he under-
stands to be the liberal position on in:
question of open dorms and other issue:
vital to the student body.

Says Sutherland, “The more responsi-
bility is heaped on the student, tho
more responsible he will be."

Thomas Charlton

Thomas H. Charlton (sociology and
anthropology) has resigned his assistant
professorship at Grinnell to take q
similar position at the University of

at Grinnell, cited greater opportunity

Something missing
In curriculum planning . . .

Intense curriculum evaluation sessions took place over vacation
in committee meetings of the presidentially-seiected Faculty com-
mittee on Educational Policy and Curriculum. In a February re-

rt to the faculty, this committee promised a "tentative and per-
aps speculative paper” to be used otter vacation for “fonnal dea
parlment, division and individual faculty comment," Thus, the
giverandrtake of faculty over the issue of curriculum change ls at a
peak presently. Whom is this evaluation designed to benefit? is its
aim ll) make the faculty better satisfied with their teaching duties?
That would certainly be fine, but is that the primary aim? Will
new programs created by the study mostly serve President Leggett
as a sales tool in tundrsising? Or is the goal an educationally pr0<
ductive curriculum for the students who actually take the courses?

The curriculum commiitee has, of course, utilized some ad-
mlrable methods in attempting to glean student opinion. They re-
quested suggestions (receiving sadly little response) and they dis-
tributed extensive questionnaires to students and recent alums. The
questionnaires did elicit what some members of the committee
consider to be a good response for a form of such length. (370 re-
plied out of a student body numbering approximately 1,150. This
does not include alums.) Committee members The Reporter talked
to expressed the desire to also consult personally with students in
dividually or in groups. While the committee has formal channels
for the gathering of individual faculty and departmental opinion,
no such formal structure exists for similar communication and
feedback with students.

This situation has its origin in President Leggett’s misguided
concept of his appointed committee, He believes curriculum mat-
ters to be solely a taculty concern. When the committee was
formed, ideas about student representation on it or a parallel stu-
dent committee were thrown out. A strong senate curriculum com-
mittee might have stepped in and demanded recognition but the
student committee was lacking — in direction and in firm, con
tinuous leadership. The student body as a whole has little of which
to be proud in the way it has allowed the study of curriculum
changes to slip through its fingers.

That stage of the study is history now. Yet them il still n
place for student participation before open questions become set
recommendations — especially since the faculty committee seems
receptive. There are several possibilities: Students could be
included in curriculum meetings called by the iaculty of their
major field. Perhaps isculty members would wish to choose a tow
seniors in their department to attend these meetings regularly or
perhaps the meetings should be open. The SGA should resurrect
the concept of a parallel student committee to the faculty’s. The
faculty committee should put a rain on further deliberations until
they have made sure that a structure for Consultation with students
has been put in ettcct. Although student participation should be the
concern of everyone at Grinnell, the responsibility for its imple
mentation will, in this case, probably rest with SGA ~ thus with

New: appraisal

The future of the theatre departmenl

by Melinda Ward

Ed. Note: The recent theater department
shake-up has resulted in a debate over tho
merits of an academic as opposed to produc-
tion oriented education in the theater. Enters
ing this controversy is Mrr Porter Woods, who
comes horn Mtddlebury College, where he is
an Assistant Professor of English and As‘
mlate Director of the Wright Memorial
Theatrer woods received his n.3, from Brown
University in English Literature, his M.
from the University or Oregon in English L t-
erature, and his D.F.A. from the Yale School
of Drama in Playwrlting and Theatre History.
He has written several plays and is presently
working on a study of the Negro playwright
in America.

President Glenn Leggett said in an interview
with The Reporter that he hopes Woods will
strengthen the academic pan of the Theatre De-
partment. Leggett stated that Woods will prob-
ably teach courses which have not been regulan
iy offered before by the department — American
Theatre, Theatre History, and Modern Dramatic
Theory. Leggett anticipates that Woods will
teach two courses a semester and that the de-
partment will be able to manage three major
productions per year.

Several theatre majors were introduced to
Woods during his recent visit to Grinnell, and
have expressed enthusiasm about the addition of
an instructor primarily Concerned with the aca-
demic aspect of theatre. In discussions with Leg-
gett and Executive Committee Chairman Joseph
Wall (history) these some students have strongly
stressed and argued that. the extracurricular and
practical aspects of the theatre should not be
sacrificed for the sake of the academic portion.
The students maintained that practical work in
the theatre is necessary for a good campus
theatre climate, since it provides experience an
students interested in the theatre as an extra-
curricular activity and preproiessionai train~
ing for theatre majors.

Leggett said at. that time that ho “had no in-
tention of slacking oil on the production end of

theatre,” yet he offered no ideas as to who would
teach introductory courses and courses in acting
and directing.

It is the feeling or many theatre and non-
theatre majors alike that students are primarily
concerned with practical courses which provide
active enjoyment and professional training. It in
s common feeling that practical theatre gen-
erates excitement in the theatre department and
that it attracts new students to the Stage. It lb
alsD felt that courses such as American Theatre
and Major British Drama could be handled in
the American Studies and English programs, as
they have been in the past.

Leggett has expressed the view that a basic
background in dramatic literature and theatre
history is necessary for maintaining excellence
in campus productions. At the same time he has
expressed his enthusiastic opinion that theatre
productions during the 196667 season have been
of excellent quality. even though he has made it
apparent by his actions that he considers the
academics in the theatre department to be in-
ferior.

Leggett’s long range plans for the department
may be admirable but they nevertheless would
seem to present an immediate problem for both
theatre majors and Grinnell theatre audiences
who are accustomed to an extracurricular and
production-oriented approach to theatre.

It would seem that this problem might have
been avoided or at least lessened had those re-
sponsible ior hiring and organizing the departs
ment been more aware of the diversity of needs
of theatre in a small liberal arts college such as
Grinnell. Students must be concerned with the
immediate, but they are capable of understand
ing long range goals. Regardless oi Wuods’ capa-
bilities and promise, the 196153 theatre season
will be a difficult one for the department, due to
this shift of emphasis and to the particular
vacuum left by present Director Richard Meyer’s
departure. It is felt by many students that in pur-
suing a total turnover of theatre personnel Legs
gett acted without adequate insight or ioresight
and without suiiiciently broad evaluation oi
the theatre department and its role in Grinnell
Cohege..

\ Nous: search for form and variety

By Nancy McCannon

Space does not allow me time for a formal
detailed criticism on Nous; this is rather on
evaluation. The hardest thing in evaluating a stu-

dent publication is deciding on your criterion. it
is simply unfair to compare beginning works with
classics. A good student work is seldom a
classic. The fairest method of evaluating is para-
lleled by distinctions in children's drawings. There
are children whose sterilized and stiff Cartoon
drawings allow only repetition and children whose
wavering lines search for form and variety. In
other words the basic criterion for judging stu-
dent art it elast‘ ty. is there enough freedom
and imagination to allow for growth?

One thing promising about Nous is that it sug-
gests that tile Salinger influenced higilly realistic
personal autobiographical, “I was lonely on the
railroad track” school of student poetry is dying
out. This allows one to read Nous Witbnllt the
haunting suspicion that the same eighteen year
old wrote the whole thing. More seriously the death
of this highly artiﬁcial convention has opened
Nous to old variety and less stock devices and
views.

A iew poets fell by the way (but not as many
as could have been predicted) on a more basic
issue, the confusion oi philosophy with poetry.
If you have a political, philosophical comment,
write an essay. Poetry simply doesn't have the
length to be a solid argument and it has other
first principles. The difference between philosophy
and poetry is comparable to the difference be
tween a minister and a lover. The former has the
obligation to be right, the latter to be good. Or
as Gertrude Stein says, “Poetry is the loving and
leaving at nouns." From this perspective, caro-
lessness and timidity with words is adultery.

In Nous as a whole then is both great an-

evenness of quality (probably unavoidable) and
variety of form (very interesting). in form it
varies from poetry in all shapes, to woodcuts,
prints, and photos, to scholarly essays.

On the student essays Gregory Robinson’s ap»
pears to be the most imaginatively scholarly. Tbs
idea is well worth considering. Howard Davidson’s
essay, while not actually applying to Paradise
Lost, has a wild and wield logic that is iunny and
appealing, I reier Don Gregory to Raymund Bells
(Historical Studies Notes 1965), “The problem of
Western Society in the last two hundred years il
creating a balance between the will of the min-
ority and of the majority, between freedom and
equality.” In other words. neither equality nor
utility are to be taken as absolutes. Because you
can think of one example in which utility must
be Considered does not mean that there are not
countless examples in which equality is the prime
consideration. One is informed by the other. Per‘
haps Western society must be willing to sacrifice
one man under certain conditions, but how about
all of Red China or the whole Jewish population?
Utility is too simple, also. There are utilities and
utilities. Art is a lie but abstract models have
their own deception. Well written but I think you
divided by zero.

of the poetry, Eleni Sarant produced the most
finished piece. Nancy Loes‘ poems contain sun-
prises, Paul Jones’ and John Herr‘s are uneven
but promising.

The art is well selected. Lester Tobias' cover,
and the woodcuts by John Thornton and Lynn
Adams are all interesting. Jon Megibow's and
Carol Morgan’s prints are sophisticated and sen—
sitive. Henry Wilhelm’s photographs show amaz-
ing growth. They show sensitivity to texture. light.
chiaroscuro. They vary 1mm surrealistic, ro-
mantic landscape in his tint on do evocative,
almost Kleelike lows landscapes I personally
would buy Nous just fit the photographs.

Meyer was conducted in an effort to
lupplemeni the facts presented in the
news article concerning the theatre de-
velopment which is also being printed
(on page 3) in this edition,
REPORTER: what prompted your
resignation?

MYER: I don't see that I should go into
the long history of problems that have
surrounded the Grinneii theatre opera-
tion for a long time. The people who
know about them already do — or if
they don't, it's because they choose not
to. The precipitating event, which i
think is public information, was the de-
gision to hire another director rather
than a technical director,

Resonant Why did you decide to re-
sign from the faculty and the depart-
ment completely, rather than remain
on as technical director yourself?
MEYER: I don't think my refusal to re-
turn to a position 1 held ten years ago
is either stubborn or surprising. There
are few faculty members who would be
willing to do that, in any situation,

I know I could have taken advantage
of the well—earned tenure and waited for
the right thing to come along, but cau<
tlon began to cost too much. My pa—
tience, willingness to compromise, and
disposition had been spent. Any prolong-
ation of the situation would have been
drawing on the capital of selfarespect,
It would have been at the sacrifice of

integrity. It's amazing how you come to
value integrity by living in the apparent
absence of it.
REPORTER: HOW do you feel you could
best fulhll your career as an educator
in theatre?
MEYER! It all boils down to this: I am
an educational theatre director. I want
In deal with students and I want to di-
rect plays, ideally in a larger operation
that allows a little less of each so that
the quality of both won't suffer from
the simple arithmetic of time. I don’t
want to play politics, and 1 don’t want
to waste time playing personal press
agent in order to please the limited but
vocal group who do.
REPORTER: Where are you going?
MEYER: Away. Sometimes that’s B spa-
Ciiic direction.
REPORTER: What are your personal
reactions to leaving Grinnell?
MEYER: or course it’s not easy to
leave. I wouldn’t have been at Grinnell
Ior ten years if I hadn't cared for the
place, and no man uproots a family of
six lightly a or at least I don’t. I hate
to leave the college and, must of all, I
hate to leave these students, Contrary

bargains the school has ever bought.

Hughes and the legislators—

By Craig Allin

Governor Harold Hughes and six
prominent legislators descended on Grin~
neil yaterday tor the fourth State Legis-
lative Seminar.

The tripartite seminar consisted of
two panels and dinner remarks by the
Governor. The afternoon session was de-
voted 00 "Motor issues at the 1967 IOWA
General Assembly — The Legislamr'l
View."

Director at Program in Practical Po-
littcol Education Edwin Gilmour set the
tone for the seminar by suggesting that
the participants were present at can
slderablo expense to themselves and to
the legislature. It was apparent that
most enjoyed the vacation.

The first session witnessed thl are
pected emphases: Democrats for strong
administration and Republicans tor leg-
lslative process,

High points of the afternoon were the
persistent attempts oi Maurice Barin-
ger, Speaker at the Iowa House, who
was billed as "a 45 year old business-
man with A Master’s degree," to cast
doubt on his credentials. in response to
a point by Senator Frommelt Mr. Bar-
inger proffered, “Democracy is govern-
ment as close to the people as possible."
No one asked how the voter could be ef-
leciiva at the county level but Lieuten<
ant Governor Fulton accomplished the
same noble purpose with a vehement "I
say baloney!"

The dinner remarks oi Governor
Hughes possessed considerable more
dignity. He praised legislators at both
parties, He defended the student's right
to tree expression but called for contribu-
tlon rather than protest.

The evening session was a partisan
freeior-all. There was general agroe~
rnent on the need for more stat! and to
Search facilities for legislators. Tho Gov-
ernor's reason: “I think they’d be bets
ter iniormed and agree more.”

Senator Rigler argued that all the staff
in the world would not help as much as
electing Republicans. Nor was speaker
Baringer idle. When Senator Rigier
asked the Governor “Why don’t. you
admit your mistake and come back to
our party?", the Speaker was heard to
mutter “He couldn’t win the primary."

E Balsmen drop opener E

The Grinnell baseball team
if r o p p e d its non-conference
opener yesterday, losing to Wll—
liam Penn, 163. It was the first
game of the season for both

teams, and their lack of prac-
tice was obvious.

Coach Gene Kowel‘t Started
Greg been on the mound. Dean

went one and a halt innings,
giving up tour runs (only one
of them earned). Dave Schatz
took over the pitching duties,
and had three runs (none
earned) scored against hlm in
two and a half inningsr Bob
Geller pitched two scoreless in«
nlngs but was replaced by Dick
Schneider in the seventh.
Schneider let in two, and was

replaced by Lee Arherman in
the eighth. A few well placed
hits and errors brought seven
more runs across for the Penn-
men.

Grinnell’s scoring came in
the fifth and seventh innings.
In the fifth, Dave Luthy singled
to right, Ron Gatton grounded
out, and Greg Dean and Boh‘
Geller walked, filling the bases.
Schneider hit into what would
have been a double play, but
the throw to first after the force
at second was wide, and Luthy
and Dean scored. In the sev-
enth, a walk and two errors
brought Geller across.

The batsmen take on C0.
tomorrow for a doubleheader at
Cedar Rapids.

The Rev. James Bevel, a director of
King’s Southern Christian Leadership

Conference, is national director of tho
“Mobilization." Individuals sponsoring
the project indeed represent a wide
variety of views and concerns. Besides
Georgia Legislator Julian Bond (also at
the Des Moines conscription conference),
other sponsors are Dr. Benjamin Spock,
Playwright Arthur Miller, SNCC leader
Carmichael, SDS leader Paul Booth,
Yale Professor Staughton Lynd, writer
Paul Goodman, and poet Allen Ginsberg.

Dr. Martin Luther King and Mr. Bond
are scheduled speakers for the Saturday
mobilizationsi

Miss Miller stressed that the demon-
strations will be directed particularly
at the U. 5. government but that she
felt they would also renew the hope
of those who participate that something
can still be done to stop the war.
“People are discouraged now, but when
they see those thousands assembled in
similar expression it will reinforce their
commitment."

She added, though, that a continuance
of the war in months to come will
result in more militant forms of pros
test. “There is some talk of civil dis-
obedience — boycotts and mass burnings
of draft cards."

' Tonight Ex Loco Parentis, Grinnell’s
new coffee house, will open. Its role,
as Alan Hanawalt, one of the founders,
has stated, is to exist as an off-campus

and entertainment will be maintained so
that it will be whatever students want
it to be.

Poetry readings, art and photographic
exhibits, short plays and recorded mu-
sic are scheduled, as well as live music
trom various Grinnell bands. Expresso
coffee, cheese, pastries, teas and fruit
will be available, as well as a Paglia]

There will be a suggested contribution
for food but no admission price.

The coffee house will be open on

the beginning week: on Tuesday there
will be it relatively quiet atmosphere

Bond claims protest demonstrations
still means of influencing officials

By Krystyna Neumao

A combination of refined, cool man-
hers and militanoy, of leading partici-
pation within the us. governmental
system and protest tactics outside it
make Julian Bond a unique leader in
American peace and civil rights
struggles.

A few years back the handsome Mr.
Bond became one of the few Negroes
ever elected to public office in Georgia;l
also one of the youngest (ho is but a
few years out of college) Yet upon
election to the Georgia State Legisla-
ture he was characteristic y a sub«
ject of controversy when i tially de-
nied a seat by fellow legislators —
apparently due to his condemnation of
the U.S. position in Vietnam,

Affect Senators, Congressmen

Mr. Bond has since been seated and
today continues to be heard on basic
issues of freedom: the freedom of the
people of South Vietnam for selfrdeter-
minafion, that of Negro in America and
the freedom of Choice in military ser-
vice to one‘s country. '

Bond’s voice now resounds far out-
side the narrow confines of Georgia
politics. Last Saturday, after a confer-
ence at Bimini, The Bahamas, on a
new black political organization, Bond
spoke in Des Moines, at a conference
studying the question of compulsory
military conscription.

At the Des Moines meeting (held at
American Friends Service Committee
headquarters) this reporter asked Mr.
Bond about the upcoming “Mass Spring
Mobilization" at which he will mak-
a keynote address.

Asked about tho efficacy of another
demonstration, Bond said, “Some people
downgrade the effect of demonstrations,
but, although I don’t think we can reach
President Johnson, senators and cons
gressmen can be influenced."

Damage otiiciuls' Credibility

(Paul Booth, Students for a Democratic
Society leader, recently told war time
testers another indication of the of-
fectlveness of the antiwar movementlI
“We had damaged the credibility of
the official explanation to the point
that 40 percent of the white middle
class and working class folk of Dear-
born, Michr, when asked, said they
wanted out of the wart")

Bond also said that, regardless of
official U.S. actions, a large number
of Americans still feel the need to ex-
press their unwillingness to tolerate the
war.

Although basically a pacifist to whom
military means are repugnant, Bond's
position on ‘military conscription, Sat-
urday's conference topic, is that if this
nation must accept militarism then he
will discuss the military — but only as
a voluntary organization. Bond objects
to the present draft system because it
does not give young men freedom in
running their own lives. For this reason
he also objects to a universal system
of conscription even though it might
allow for alternative forms of national
service, including social service.

‘Not a Military Nation’

Bond’s adversary in the debate at the
conference, iowa State Director of Sea
Iective Service Colonel Glenn R. Bowles,
took the position that compulsory con-
scription is necessary because volun-
tary enlistments never fill military re-
quirements. Bond thought that if sni-
aries were raised in the armed forces
enough men would chose the military
as tlicy would any career.

Unlike Bond, there was no doubt in
Bowles‘ mind, of course, as to the
necessity of this nation using military
means. Bowles said such means are
necessary in order for the US. to

protect democracy and other, smaller
nations from aggression and communism.
Buwles added, however, that the U.S. is
definitely not a military nation -
even though it was pointed out during
discussion that the US. economy is
geared to military spending.

Not Powell‘s organization

Questioned about a conference in
Bimini, The Bahamas oi Negro leaders,
including ousted Harlem congressman
Adam Clayton Powell, which resulted
in the announcement of the birth of
a “black political power third force,"
Bond expressed regret that the press
had called it Powell’s organizationl‘
“It’s not his, it’s not anyone’s, It’s an
organization of elected Negro officials."

“The announcement didn’t come out
the way we planned — it’s also a mis-
take to assume its a third party. We
just started and no one has a clear
idea of what it will be.

Geared to State, National Levels

“it was formed for people who have
much in common, including similar
problems. We will have more influence
in the state legislatures if we are all
working together; some think — Cal-
ifornians, for instance — we can hav-
more effect on the party.

"The organization will function on
both a state and national level. In
Georgia, my state, the L3 Negroes
holding public office have already ioimd
it more effective to be working as a
unit. Then too, the 20 Negro official!
from Georgia, Texas and Tennessee have
started to meet together and found it
very beneficial."

did order the installation of emergency
exit hardware on certain outside Quad
doors.

Section 1.2 of the Iowa code requires
exits to be arranged to permit unob-
structed egress from all occupied builds
ings and prohibits the installation of
locks which prevent free escape.

Fred C, Hess, director of public to-
lations, noted that Soderquist had not
been alarmed by the condition of the
college buildings, but that several fea-
tures must be installed to comply with
the law. "We have not kept pace with
the times," Hess admittedl He claimed,
however, that Grinnell's fire safety
problem is not critical, noting that the
fire marshal has given the college un—
til September 1 to comply with regula-
tions.

Besides the Gates-Rawson Tower door
and panic bars in the Quad, the fol-
lowing safety featurcs are plannedil
fireproofing of certain doors, walls and
ceilings, extended and additional fire
escapes, installation of one-hour fire«
separation doors (doors that take an
hour to burn through). and improvement
of alarm systems.

6 students die in Cornell fire

A Cornell University residence hall,
believed to be fireproof, was the scene
of tragedy last Wednesday. Eights stu.
dents and one pmlessor died there in a
blaze termed “unbelievable” by the build.
or of the structure. Timothy McKibben,
son of William McKibben (classical
languages), was among the survivors.
