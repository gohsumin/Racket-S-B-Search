Registrar Reveals Grinnell Suffers
From Limited ‘Withdrawal’ Symptoms

In the dead of winter wild
rumors often circulate the
campus about the number of
students Who withdrew or flunked
out of Grinnell during the
Christmas recess. Here are the
statistics according to the
records of the Registrar.

A total of twenty-nine students
withdrew permanently from
Grinnell College after the first
semester. There were seventeen
voluntary withdrawals ( some of
which may be transfers to other
colleges) and twelve academic
dismissals. In addition, 16
students went on either academic
or personal leaves and‘twentyasix
enrolled in oif-campus ACM
programs. Five students com~
pleted their graduation
requirements atmid-year, 0n the
other side of the balance sheet,
twenty-nine students returned
from leaves. The total size of the
student body at the beginning of
the second semester was 1107, of
which 593 were men and 509 were
women. In addition there were
a few special students and a few
unclassified students.

According to Dale Terry,
Registrar and Director oi Adr
missions, about one-third of the
students who leave Grinnell for
any reason before they have
completed their requirements for
graduation normally leave at
midryear. Seventyone students
left after the first semester. Last
year a total of 176 students left
for all reasons. The number of
academic dismissals is higher
than usual for midyear. Three
or four is more typical. Terry
expressed confidence that there
would be fewer such dismissals
than usual after second semester
as a result of this.

Ten years ago the yearly with-
drawal rate was roughly fifteen
percent of the student body.
Between 1961 and 1966 with-
drawals were fairly steady,

Bowers Atquitted
In Assault Trial

The following is the statement
of Judge Lincoln concerning the
trial of the state vs, Edd Bowers:

It is the conclusion of this Court
based on sworn testimony that
a reasonable doubt exists as to
the alleged assault on the person
of Lawrence Frank at the Main
Lounge oi Grinnell College on
December 18, 1969 by the
defendant Edd Bowers.

Therefore the Court finds the
defendant Edd Bowers not guilty
and costs of the action be charged
to Poweshiek County State of
Iowa.

Dated this February 3, 1570.

around twelve per cent per year.
During the last two lull academic
years the withdrawal rate has
again been about fifteen per cent.
At Grinnell one per cent oi the
student body is roughly eleven
students.

Mr. Terry stated some reasons
for the rise in withdrawals during
the last two or three years. First,
the number and capacity of ACM
programs has increased. Second,
the College has relaxed its policy
on granting academic and per-
sonal leaves, He indicated that
there was an unusually high with
drawal rate in 1967-68 (15.7 per
cent) for a number of reasons.
The high withdrawal rate was
partly a fluke and partly an
expression of uncertainty about
the future of the college. The
junior class, which entered in
that year, shows a decided imr
balance in males and femalesglw
males, as females. The junior
class is smaller than the senior
class, which also reﬂects the
withdrawals in 1967-63.

“The great majority of trans»
tags from Grinnell occurs in
freshman and sophomore
women," said Terry. Students
have many reasons for trans-
ferring. Some dislike the social

Honorary Degrees
Voted; Changes in
Credit-Fail Program

Last Monday, the faculty held
their second meeting of this
semester. President Leggett
announced that the following four
men will be offered honorary
degrees at commencement this
spring: Horace Mann Bond, and
three Grinnell graduates:
Messrs. Stoessinger ’50, Mathews
‘20, and Rew ’07. The President
also noted that the current
average faculty-student ratio
was 1:10. In a conversation With
the 5&3, he lamented the fact
that a college the size of Grinnell
cannot afford to maintain for; long
this desirable state of affairs.

The faculty decided to make
several changes in the credit»fail
option program. A student is now
allowed to take courses in his
secondary field with the credit-
fail option. Also, courses in the
ACM Urban Studies Program
and the Colorado College Sum-
mer institute may be taken on
the creditrfail basis and can be
applied to major and secondary
fields,

atmosphere. Others wish to
obtain more vocational training.
Still others, “A" students in high
school, find the academic
competition more intense than
they want Others do not like
living in a small town.

Transferring students tend to
go to universities, which would
be less expensive and larger.
“But when students transfer to
small colleges,” {said
Terry,“they tend to go tu very
good small schools."

The college must get students
to replace those who have with—
drawn. Mr, Terry indicated that
it takes four applications to
replace one student. Since the
college does not get many
transfer students, it is difficult
to restore balance in the various
classes once it is lost, Mr. Terry
predicted that the college will
probably receive between 1350
and 1400 applications for ad-
mission this year. About four
hundred new students will be
admitted. Applications to
Grinnell have been increasing in
recent years, according to Terry,
even though at many schools the
number of applications seems to
be dropping somewhat. In- ad
dition, the percentage of students
who accept admission to the
college once it is offered has risen
considerably during the last five
years. in 1965 it was 42 per cent;
and this has increased by regular
jumps, to 60 per cent last year.
Terry indicated that in this
respect Grinnell compares quite
favorably with the other schools
in the nation.

'The Battle of Algiers':

Anatomy of in Revolution

by Alan G. Nasser
Instructor of Philosophy

,politics is the soul of

Tire Victory of the People‘s War!

During an interspace of
silence, the interviewer John
Swinton interrupted Karl Marx
with the question “What IS?” The
philosopher's reply was swift and
emphatic. Struggle.” If there is
substance to this Marxian social
metaphysic, 'then Gillo Pon-
tecorvo’s The Battle of Algiers
is a stunning depiction of the
ontology of revolution. We see.
in an unprecedented application
of cinema veritE to a recon-
structed historical event, the
heroic and dogged struggle of the
National Liberation Front in the
war for Algerian independence

primer for what is to happen in
American cities in the near
future?”

And Battle is not without its
moments of wry irony, When
French paratroopers enter the
city to smother the rebellion, it
is made clear that their com-
mander, colonel Mathieu, was a
hero of the Resistance "They
call us fascists," says Mathieu,
“forgetting that some oi us are
survivors of Dachau and
Buchenwald” a delicate
reminder that yesterday’s
liberals are all too oiten today's
oppressors.

The Battle of Algiers is, in a
number of ways, a paradoxical
film. For it absorbs you totally
and completely, yet it never
appeals to Hollywood’s stock
cinematic formula of absorption,
such as romantic acting
techniques, flashy editing and
cutting, and rapidly sentimental
dialogue. It will drain you
emotionally, perhaps as no other
film ‘has. You will see Grinnell’s
favorite formula film, The

Pawnhrpher presens an entirely
superficial treatment of a tragic
situation, and tricks you into

emotions with Hollywood's most
familiar techniques. Battle

Last Friday, February 6th, a statemerttwas placed
in our college post office box informing us that Henry
Wilhelm, Krystyna Neuman, et 31. were leaving the
staff of Pterodactyl 7 temporarily, they assure us.
Going into exile like Leon Trotsky before them, they

are leaving
revisionists.

the situation

in control of fascist

As Mr. Wilhelm, Miss Neuman, and their friends
carefully point out, the change in policy on the part

of the rest of the Pterodactyl staff

“ain’t our

revolution.” We are glad to See the revolution at last
showing its true colors. It seems that there never really
is very much room in a revolution for idealists afte;
power becomes a question. Those who work in the
name of any legitimately sanctioned freedom will be
crowded out by others with fewer scruples and more

ruthless methods.

Our editorial policy differs radically from that of
current and past Staff members of Pterodactyl; yet
we are disappointed by this turn of events. At least
Mr. Wilhelm, Miss Neuman, and their friends were
working for a principle or set of principles, however
different from our own, Bruce Nissen has said that
he and his friends are “working for a society that’s
above freedom of speech.” Presumably after Mr.
Nissen’s revolution has gone beyond his newspaper

into society at large, the ‘

‘culture and politics of the

majority” will be used to determine what other changes
must be made in the Bill of Rights, Perhaps his society
will be above other freedoms.

It is not too surprising, then, that Mr. Wilhelm refers
to Grinnell’s “anarchist-socialists" as “fascists,” and
we are amused to note one more instance in which
the politiciansof the far left have gone so far that they
are practically indistinguishable from their brothers

on the extreme right.

Students Try Experiment in New

Freshman Humanities Program
By Betsy Erickson

Grinnell's traditional freshman
humanities program is being
challenged by a new non-credit
experimental seminar led by Ric
MacDowell. The reading list
includes Camus‘ The Stranger,
Beckett’s Waiting for Godot.
Carson's Silent Spring, and
Jacobs’ Death and Life of Great
American Cities. ,

At the first course meeting,
held February 4th in the South
Lounge, MacDowell and ap-
proximately twenty participants
discussed their expectations for
the course. MacDowell feels that
many freshman come to Grinnell
excited about learning, and that
they quickly lose interest when
they don't feel challenged by
“classics" wllich they consider
irrelevant to their lives. Some of
(his enthusiasm could be retained
if they, in organized groups,
could read and discuss Works
related to today's social
problems.

Many students agreed with
MacDowell. One said she felt a
gap in her learning, and that she
did not know how to fill it, Others
stated that classes are imr
personal, and some instructors
do not appear to be interested

in their subjects. In general, they
thought they would get more
from group discussions of the
topics than from their own
readings.

MacDowell originally became
inlerested in the project While
doing research on freshman. He
thought that perhaps the second
semester humanities program
could be changed to include more
Works relevant to student's
lives. He first discussed this with
Dean Wall, then brought it before
the humanities committee. They
rejected his suggestions, so
MacDoWell decided to test his
ideas in an experimental
seminar.

The change in approach to
learning is as important here as
thc change in material offered.
Many humanities sections consist
mainly of lectures with little
student participation, whereas
MacDowell’s approach allows
much more freedom of
discussion. It is hoped that this
approach will be incorporated
into the regular humanities
program so that the
disillusionment many freshmen
find will not carry on to their
remaining college years.

Letters to the Editor . . .

OpenLetter:

After this semester’s first soil;
editorial 7 an editorial ill~
disposed toward effective student
participation in the school’s
decisionrmaklng process 7 I
have made every effort to get
the Steering Committee (Phil
Mcars, Bruce Nissen, Mick
Schalmann, and myself) to
respond to this editorial, since it
directly affects the work of our
committee, My proposal was to
call for a teach-m (which as I
believe would have been an
appropriate form of mass
communication). The following
were my reasons:

First, our committee, which is
supposed to work for “new
structures” that allow for more
effective student participation on
nearly all levels of decisronr
making, cannot obtain its
legitimacy by its sheer eXlstence
through election. Rather, we can
only obtain legitimacy from
continuous interaction and
mutual communication between
the student body and our com-
mittee. We must not be a
separatist elitist group.
Therefore, since the mentioned
editorial affected our work, we
should have taken the Op-
portunity of a teach-in during
wllich we could have talked about
the implications of the editorial
on our work, Since the editors'
and our views are contrary, I
regarded it as essential for our
future work to fllld out the
response of other students.

Second, and perhaps more
important, a teach-m would
contribute to the political
education of students. Many
students at the moment are
politically apathetic, There are
not many people that are con-
cerned about the political and
social implications of this
educational system. However, if
we do not realize these political
and social implications, We

cannot execute effective student
participation. A structure super-
imposed on apathetic students
would be impotent. This struc7
ture could never serve its vends
unless students realize its
political Slgnificance. Political
awareness is the prerequisite for
effective student participation.
The bourgeois. the politically
apathetic, has to be transformed
inlo the Ciloycll. the politically
aware. And in teach-ins, where
we can communicate with the
whole student body rather than
with some few committee
members, we could have talked
about the political relevance of
our education. It could have been
astart.

Since the other members of the
Steering Committee had contrary
views on this issue, however, and
since I regard this political
concern as the conditio sine qua
non for “workable new struc-
tures," i am forced to resign,

This resignation from the
Steering Committee is not a
resignation from my effort to
generate political awareness. As
long as this political awareness
remains only a potential, 1 cannot
be part of a group which attempts
to superimpose a structure on
students who do not fully realize
the political significance of this
structure,

Bourgeois or citoyent'. We all
will have to make a decision.
Political apathy, trying to stay
away from getting involved, is
a decision too,

TotheEditor:

Last week's editorial cons
coming the distribution by the
student Senate of the $50,000 plus
activities fee was slightly
misleading, to say the least. If
we inignt elaborate a hit, that
editorial may be placed in the
proper lighl.

The figures for total or
pcllditul'cs quoted in the article

were approximately correct, but
accurate Information on the
distribution of thoseifunds was
lacking. At the end of the last
year, the Finance Committee of
the Senate approved ex-
penditures of $54,775 for this
school year ($27,337.50. per
semester). Income for the first
semester was $26,649 ($23.50 from
each of 1138 students), and the
deficit of $738,550 was paid out of
the Senate’s emergency budgets
balancing fund, General Budget
and Reserve (GB&R). This
semester, due to attrition (we
have only 1080 students), the
budget will have to be Cut since
GB&Rcann0t make up the deflcit
of$2,007.50. ,

Concerning the allocation 'of
this $54,775, the readers will be
glad to learn that the Social
Coordinating Committee
receivcs $32,690 (about 60 per
cent of the total) for their con-
certs, movies, dances, etc. The
individual halls and the Initiative
Fund are allocated a total of
$7,725 (14 per cent); $2,150 (4 per
cent) goes for speakers and
special programs (such as the
Drug Symposium); Nous'
replacement, something called
Montage (7) gets $1,100 (2 per
cent); and Radio KDIC receives
$2,750 (5 per cent), The Senate
itself does have a working fund
This year the Senators allocated
themselves $2,860 (5 per Cent) of
which $2,200 goes for executive
and secretary salaries, This
leaves only $450 in the Senate's
account. The Senate also has at
its disposal about $1,000 which
was not spent from last year’s
budget; and, pending the for
mation of a Speakers Committee,
the Senate controls tlle Speakers
Fund

counted for on per cent of that

Now the son oi the gov»

and the son of the man who
aspires to be Governor of New
York In the latter case, it
transpires that two oi the eight
children have ”experimented”
with marijuana, A Congressman
informs me that. there is sudden
interest by the legislature in the
Koch Bill (which would set up
a presidential commission to
inquire scientiiically into the
eiiects oi the use at pot),
resulting iroin many
Congressmen’s having come to
know that their own sons and
daughters are taking pot. And,
oi course, the new crime bill,
which awaits action by the House
of Representatives. calls for
reducing the penalty tor smoking
pot , though by no means
elimiiiatiiigit.

How tempting it is to say
merely that pot should be
legalized That, for instance, Is
the recommendation of Mr.
Joseph Alsop, who comes back

it is easier for a minor to obtain

Those arguments are cogent,
but they pay iiisuiiicient ale
teniioii to the psychic dimension
oi the problem Here are three
examples.

A senior in college advises me
that a classmate in an adjacent
room, who in the ﬁrst two years
oi college liic participated ac-
tivcty in sports and journalism,
non smokes pot instead. 1 say
instead because the boy in
question smokes tour or iive
times a week, beginning shortly

certainly this particular one)
becomes thoroughly absorbed in
his euphoria, Alter while, he does
not readily comprehend the book
he is reading, which is in any
casca distraction: bettci- just the
pot, and the music. Now four or
live days in which you give over
to pot tour or live hours per day
oiyo‘ur time, means about twenty
hoiu-s per week in which you are
withdrawn from actual intellec»

of my friend that his friend has,

A WORD EDGEWISE

by John P. Roche

Several times in the course of
the last year this column has sugr
ested that Senator Fred Harris,
whatever his personal merits,
“as not the man to be Chairman
of the Democratic National
Committee Tllclirst tlmeI made
this observation, former Vice
President l-lubert l-lumphrey took
strong exception and deiended
Harris with his characteristic
enthusiasm. Subsequently, as
recent newspaper inter-views
with Humphrey indicate, Harris
appears to have lost the cone
fldcnee of Ills initial patron. The
disastrous failure of the Miami
Beach “Gala Performance and
Ball” on February 5, which had
been billed as the biggest iunde
raiser in history and ended up
as a iiasco, would suggest that
Harris’ days are numbered.

In a rational world run by
logicians this would undoubtedly
be the case. But politics, to the
despair ci logical purists,
operates on somewhat different
premises which, by the way,
are not lacking in cold logic oi
their own, though it is oiten
concealed behind a smoke screen
oi diversionary rhetoric Right
now, while all hands protess
loyalty to the Party and the
D,N.C ,lhe Democrats are busily
implementing the enclave
theory. Local organizations are
desperately trying to deiend
themselves against\growing
Republican power; whatever
money they raise is put in the
pot tor the 1970 elections in their
own bailiwicks.

As far as the D.N.C. is
concerned, the word is out, “Who
needs it?" In addition, extremely
powerful elements oi the
Democratic coalition are quite
happy to leave Harris as the
trustee in bankruptcy. Efforts to
unseat him have been discussed,
but the general ieeling among
critics is that until at least 1971

Harris is periectly qualitied to
be custodian of the $7 million debt
run up in 1968 Humphrey’s
generous gesture in suggesting
that the DN.C. should pick up
the tab in Eugene McCarthy’s
and Robert Kennedy's primary
expenscs was a major cause oi
disaiicction. As one Humphrey
stalwart put it, ”Whoever heard
oi putting the opposition on the
payrolli"

Not only does Harris have them
on the payroll, but in a burst oi
ecumenical zeal he appointed -
obviously with Humphrey’s
approval , a number oi the more
acerbic advocates of the “new
politics” to the Democratic
Advisory Council. This makes for
good clean fun - Ken Galbraith
is no mean entertainer, and
Gloria Stein does add a certain
decor - but it automatically
converts the D.A.C. into a
debating society. Serious
Democrats in 1970 can hardly
spend their time arguing whether
Senator Gale McGee’s defeat in
Wyoming (for supporting the war
in Vietnam) should be top
priority, They have no time to
spend for children’s games.

So the “Titanic” sails on, Fred
Harris at the helm, leaving
behind on the pier two vital
components iii any possible
Democratic majority: the loyal
Democrats from the South,
Southwest, and Border states
who are valiantly righting a two-
iront war against George
Wallace on one side and the
G.O,P. on the other, and the AFIr
CIO, which has taken a grim
reading or the iacts of political
lite and is preparing tor a siege.

From their vantage point.
these groups are fighting for
simple political survival. To
them the revolution that the
spokesmen oi the “new polities”
were heralding in 1968 has
already come , but from the
opposite direction, the right in-

is therelore not “Where do We

l‘eallzatlon of a moral and
pollilcal commitment: it is not
a romantic adventure Pontiac
corvo understands this
brilliantly. It is a lactlcal and
technical maneuver oi no little
derrlng~do that the director is
able to sustain an extraordinary
sense of documentary authcn»
ticity while employing some of
the most difficult lilm-making
techniques. For example, Pontea
corvn’s use of freezerframes to
handle time lapses in no way
detracts from the reality of the

But there is in evidence a far
more profound irony, and it
stems from the fact that this film
is being shown at Grinnell
College in the heartlands of the
U.S.A. while we pursue a dis—
astrous War in Southeast Asia.
The similarity of France‘s efforts
in Algeria to U.S. involvement
in Vietnam is striking. For
although Vietnam has never been
a legal colony of the U.S., as
Algeria was of France, virtually
every other point of comparison
is valid. in both cases we have
popular based colonial wars of
liberation waged against Western
capitalist powers, who, with the
cooperation of a locally despised
ruling elite, have tried to sup
press the liberation movement in
the name of anti-Communism. In

torture and to the creation of
concentration camps, euphemr
istically called centres dc
rcgronpcincnt by the French,
"strategic hamlets" by the
Americans. And in each case
racist motives are clearly in
evidence: recall the French
man’s traditional denigration
ol the Arab, comparable to our
“yellow peril," and Lyndon
Johnson's no\v
reference to Asians as “yellow
dwarfs Wlth pocket kniies.” in
both France and America, street
demonstrations against the war
resulted in unprecedented police
brutality, and draft resislers (in
France they had an ofﬁcial title:
Jeune Resistance) were forced
into hiding or out of the country.

Now it is evident, I think, to
all of us that as Americans we
bear the same responsibility for
the continuance of American in-
volvement in Vietnam as French
men did for their country’s atro-
cities in Algeria. What is equally
evident, but not nearly as widely
recognized, is that we of Grinnell
College, as American
academicians. are much closer
to the springs of brutal U.S. inter-
vention in Southeast Asia (and
elsewhere) man we care to
think. A brief examination of
bourgeois Social Science, as
taught by virtually every
American institution of higher
learning, will bear my contention
out.

Consider the cases of Political

Now this casts grave doubts upon

question the value of preserving

when the existing structure is

Senate Discusses Newspaper;
Possible Support for Thomas

Lately there has been a lot of
pressure put on the folks who run
the SRiB to answer student de-
mands that the editors and staff
try to conﬁne their political views
to the editorial page and leave
reporting. editing, and layout
free from the oppressive burdens
oi political bias. The college com-
munity desires that this paper
approach its coverage of events
and issues with complete political
objectivity.

In an attempt to establish an
objective distance between my
assignment and my political
prejudices (such a distance
would obviously facilitate a de-
tached View of the senate
meetings( I now submit a report
on a senate meeting which i did
not attend. Although sprinkled
With fact, this report is essential-
1y composed from rumor, mali-
cious gossip, and slanderous
character assasination.

Johanna Ward is finally a
senator.

Mick Schaalman reported from
the student-faculty ‘student
power’ negotiations. Mick said a
forthcoming statement would
“tell all," but he did announce
that progress has been made in
establishing plans for student in-
volvement in general education
reqm'i-ements and other aca»
demic affairs, Mick pointed out
that his committee was dealing
with only academjc issues, and
that other committees would
have to take it upon themselves
to work out plans for residence
reforms, social guidelines,
grapes in the jello, etc.

Mick asked that the senate fill
the three vacancies on the com-
mittee (Prawn, Stranger, and
Schwartz), and the senate was
delighted to oblige (Alan Cohen,
Jim Lew, and Frank Thomas.)

Jon Stein has received per
mission from Mrs, J, Hawk and
Mr. S, Chuck to sell food in the
Cafe del Faro from B-l2 on Friday
and Saturday night. The fare will
include tea. coffee, pastry. bagels

and lox (pronounced “‘lahks”).

Expansion of sales to Tuesdays
thru Thursday and a gala Sunday
brunch seem feasible for the
future,

Moved by his fellow students’
hunger for relevant reading
matter, Mike Penzner asked the
senate to give postable copies of
the minutes to house presidents.

Mike then asked the senate to
revoke the finance committee’s
ruling that no hall can get its
social funds if it has outstanding
damage fines, (The rationale for
this ruling is that the finance
committee does not want hails
to pay oii tines with social
money.) Mike, desiring to return
the power to his people, asserted
that a hall should be able to
determine how it wishes to spend
its money. Whirlwind debate on
halls and hall funds resulted in
the passing of a motion that no
hall funds could be spent without
a major vote of the hall, but a
motion to revoke the original ii-
nance committee ruling about
denying initiative funds to halls
with outstanding damage bills
was defeated.

Henry Wilhelm, Torn assured the
senate that they would not be the
major contributors to the paper
and, therefore, would not be re
Sponsible for legal hassles which
might come up.

Frugal Andy Loewi wanted to
know if Tom had returned the
senate money from his opus “,The
Second Battle of Chicago.” Tom

assurance that part of the money
had been returned, Debate

stead cione “biggy.”

Frank Thomas, in an unfortuns

that the senate give Tom “all the
money he wants.” Tom asked for
fifty thousand dollars, but Frank
only had one buck on him and
refused to give it to Tom bccause
he needed to play ping-pong alter
the meeting.

Someone asked Doug Klein,
mild-mannered student auditor,
if the student government had the
money to give to Tom in the event
that they vote to do so. Doug’s
reply was a firm, self-assured “I
don’tknmv."

revealed a sharp mind. For in
stance, concerning the lndians’
demands for government reim»
bursement for confiscated lands,
Papakee quipped, “If they paid
us, maybe we wouldn’t have to
be doing this (singing).” The
audience seemed to have great
respect tor Papakee and his
music, although they did not
personally identify with it.

Following the Papakecs was
Glen Ohrlin, superb yarn-spinner
and master of the art of un
derstatement. With a completely
straight face, Ohrlin amused
everyone with his tales and
cowboy ballads, while ac-
companying himseli with a
simple unsophisticated guitar
strum.

Bukka white, quite a
storyteller himself, also got a
warm reception. His strong,
hardrdriving, blues beat counter-
balanced some fine, delicate
guitar improvisation. Especially
impresswe was his use of a metal
cylinder on his left hand. which
achieved dobroseffects on his all
metal guitar.

Maybelle Carter, best known of
all the participants, did some
fairly good flatspioking and
doublethumbing on banjo and
guitar, but her singing technique
did not quite measure up to her
reputation. In addition, her
compulsion to apologize ex-
cessively made her seem very
unsure of herself and distracted

It is true ttiat one of the major

that the Senate has control of the

about $500 for tiie Marcll on

edge of the position paper and
the progress the steering com-
mittee had made in negotiating
with the taculty. AS tar as we
are able to ascertain, neither oi
the editors has ever attended a
women’s liberation meeting as
was demonstrated by the lack of
insight in your second editorial,
Your third editorial 7 and here
again we have never noticed your
iaces at a Senate meeting — is
also a credit to your irresponsible
journalism, To put it bluntly, you
don't know what you're talking
about, You stated in your
editorial “that there are no ap-
parent laws which regulate
Senate expenditures.” However,
every allocation oi the Senate,
as with any Senate action, is
subject to veto by a student
referendum. You go on to state
that “the Senate can do as it
pleases with our money," Need
we remind you that all Senators
are elected at large by the
student body. The editors of the
sea, which this year received a
larger Senate allocation than
ever before ($5,500.00), are
chosen (often for political
reasons) by a committee with
only direct student members.

Let us proceed to examine
some or your specific charges.
To begin with, the Pterudactyl
never received a penny irom the
present Senate. You suggest in
your editorial that the Senate
might “considerably reduce”
Social funds in order to subsidize
Pterodactyl. Should the
Senate decide to subsidize
any other newspaper, money
would be taken from general
budget and reserve and not the
social coordinating fund, which
this year also has a greater
allocation than ever before. The
Senate never allocated money for
a dog house, and the “few pear
ple" who went to the Washington
Moratorium were 80 strong.

Other “ransacking” activities
of the Senate include subsidizing

it highly successful and beneficial
Drug Symposium to which the
Senate gave $650, Supporting the
Grinnell area Moratorium ac-
tivities, and pledging another
soon to this spring’s conterence
on the American Working Class,
all of which would have been im-
possible to do without the
Senate'ssupport,

Clearly, the Senate’s use of
funds has been more responsible
than the editorial policy ot this

SCARLET 8 BLACK SPORTS

mmeeeeeee seaweeds; THE WEEKLY SPORT SPALE codenamerawarae fearsome

Lament of The Editor:

It is Characteristic of colum-
nists and commentators to spend
much of their time elaborating
the answers to asinine questions
of their own devising. This
perversity is especially promi-
nent at Grinnell, since most
pressing questions seem to gen-
erate bizarre pentacostal revi-
vals of the confrontative or cons
fessional sort on the one hand,
or a particularly ghastly form of
death by attrition known as the
ad hoc committee on the other.

The outcome of this, quite
apart from a plethora of disenr
questioned answers, is the under-
standable reluctance of anyone
to expose himself to this regu-
larly, much less weekly. Do any
of you have any idea of what it’s

like to ask a question here'! I
sent out a questionnaire iast

week: “What is the value of
sports?" In response to this I
received 17 signed confessions of
implication, 2 angry denials, a
complimentary subscription to
Christian Economics, advice to
consult the Shorter Oxlord
Greek-English Lexicon
(provided, of course, that I am
willing to accomodate myself to
the 'n‘uth) and 8 pounds 5V2
ounces of Monmouth College
press releases.

I also received a form letter
from the University of Iowa's
Athletic Director informing me
that it depended upon ability and
so forth, but that sports could be
worth up to $1,900 a year laundry
money, plus board, bed, and tui-
tion. This, of course, does not
include whatever endorsements,
Bar Mitzvah‘s, and such like
could be picked up on the side.
Nor did he fail to mention the
possibility of a small Cut of a
brass plaque (Richard Nixon
autogrjph model) given an ex-
ceptional year and a restirgence
of Democratic sentiment in Iowa.
These of course, are the im-
ponderables of chance that a
good sportsman must learn to
face bravely in this cause and
effect universe,

All of Which does criminally
conspire to bring me to within
seizing distance of the point of
all this. For it is my,pride (and
I say this unashamed) that a
Sportspage can be run on sports-
men’s principles, good, clean,
and decent. Just as it is the
American way to play to win, so,
failing this, it is the American
Way to field a team, play for a
stipulated length of time on the
proper sort of field, and follow
all sorts of splendid provisions
which, along with those of vicV
tory, are laid away in the Rule
Books.

Cause and Effect in the news-
paper game begins on Sunday
night, Each Sunday night there
is a staff meeting, in which the
staff meets in the 8&3 room to
sit on the typewriters and watch
Lloyd and Harry light their pipes.
I frequently cannot go to this

meeting due to unavoidable
circumstances such as my for-
getting it.

Then on Monday morning,
Lloyd sneaks up on me in the
Forum while I am wondering
why l ever bothered to get up.
He lights his pipe and asks how
the ol’ Sportspage looks this
week. Ilie to him cheerfully and
he goes off happy.

There are only two fundamen-
tal axioms necessary to this
craft:

Axiom One: Sports happens
on Friday and Saturday

Axiom Two: The college
information office has the
scores and a small stockpile of
jargon on Tuesday afternoons
for immediaterelease

AX. 2, Schol. 1: It might well
behoove the editor to be there
on Tuesday afternoon.

Thus I am freed to spend
Monday and Tuesday in whole-
some pursuits such as dancing
the Egyptian Polka and shooting
Polar Bears.

Until Wednesday, that is. On
Wednesday, Harry sneaks up to
tell me that he's got a photograph
of a basketball or something. He
wants to know if I have a story
for it.

So it’s Wednesday, and I need
a writer. A good way of getting
a writer is by means of what we
in the trade call Cajolery. Cajol-
ery is when you write an anony-
mous letter, threatening to place
a bomb in the gas tank of his
diseased 1959 Buick unless the
writer delivers a Sepage article
to the 8&3 office in a plain brown
wrapper by Thursday noon.

Thursday is layout day, when
it is incumbent upon everyone to
read the letters to the Editors
and walk around bawling “I Want
photos," “I want headlines.” and
“I want a special greasy proofs
reading pencil with no tooth-
marks on it,” and so forth. This
yields a layout, three nervous
breakdowns, and a warm feeling
of professional pride.

Then we put Lloyd and Harry
in the car, tell them that they
can‘t have their pipes back until
the papers are in the mailboxes,
and take a well~deserved rest.

Allof which goes to point up
the truth of what a Great Ameri-
can (Vince Lombardi. I think it

easternmost?

Undefeated Grinneii Swimmers Roll Over
How To Write The Weekly Article Carleton, St. Olaf' Face Knox This Week

Enjoying an enthusiastic full
house Friday and Saturday, the
swim team’s last home meets
were particularly excellent. Fri-
day’s effort was outstanding, as
we defeated with ease our
toughest competition so far this
season. Most of the team turned
in their year’s best times, and
the weekend provided for new
school record;

Friday’s Carletonmeet started
out Well with a victory in the
medley relay. Ron Brammer,
Bruce McKean, Jim Williams,
and Jim Carms teamed up to win
the vital seven points. Mike

Strong words, coming from one
of the Establishment‘s own

question is open,‘yet academe’s

What is especially noteworthy
about all this is the affinity of
our Social Science and our
foreign policy. Surely
U.S. postwar foreign policy is
accurately described as Counter-
revolutionary Interventionism.
The Truman, Eisenhower,
Kennedy, Johnson Doctrines
speak the message clearly, as do
our aggression in Greece,
Lebanon, Guatemala, Iran,
Brazil, Laos, the Dominican
Republic, Vietnam, etc.
Academic Social Science, as in—
tellectual votary of the status
quo. is not only ideological propa—
ganda, but counterrevolutionary
propaganda. Thus, if Social
Science provides a counterrevol-
utionary rationale for U.S. global
policies, and U.S. educational in-
stitutions are a crucial source of
official Social Science, our
colleges and universities are
umbilically tied to the barbarities
of U. 5. foreign policy, This is
not surprising, as imperialism’s
body politic has always required
a functioning brain. We in»
tellectuals are cells of that very
brain. What irony, then, that we
watch Battle of Algiers horriﬁed
and shaken by what we See, while
at the same time we are func-

Rollins broke the school and pool
record in the zoo; his 1:53 tied
the conference record in that
event (unofficial.)

Saturday against St. olaf Rollie
broke another school and pool
record, He beat last year's con
ference champ and the runner
up in that event by swimming
a 27.5 sec. on yo. freestyle. Jim
Williams turned in a 2:195 sec,
200 yd, backstroke for his best
of the year. Also turning in
season‘s best times were: Robert
Brown (500), John McBlain
(1000), Hal Dale (200 butterﬂy),
and Jim Carns (200 free). Don
Like won the diving both days
with little competition from
either school.

This week we face Knox at

Galesburg. It will be our toughest
meet so far, although the tough»
est of the year will be against
Cornell, Feb. 27, Cornell is the
defending Champion in swimr
ming, and whoever wins the
Grinnell-Cornell meet could very
well be this year's conference
champ. Cornell even promises
that a band is coming to cheer
its team on during the meet.
We need the support of anyone
who could make it to the meet.
There is the possibility of a bus
going if enough people are inter-
ested. Contact Kathy Abbott or
Jim Williams if you would like
to go Friday. Feb. 27. to see an
undefeated Grinnell team face,
last year‘s conference champs in
the best meet of the season.
