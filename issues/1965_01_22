Used Book Coop
Debuts Monday

A Student book coop will be
set up beginning Monday,
Feb. 25. The project, spon-
sored by an SGA committee
is set up as a service for the
campus.

Signe Hansen, chairman of
the committee said, “We felt
there was a need for a service
to provide students with reason-
able and consistent process as
well as a convenient, central lo-
cation for buying and selling
used books," in explaining the
purpose of the coop,

The coop will operate from
Monday until the beginning of
second semester in room 23 of
ARH from 2:30 until 4:00 p.m,
through Friday, If there is suf<
ficlent demand, it will also be
open on Saturdays and for a
week into the second semester.

It will handle books that will
be used for courses next semes-
ter, Miss Hansen explained.
However, she said, a bulletin
board will be provided for
books that are for sale but not
required for courses next se—
mester, The coop will handle
both paper back and hard back
books.

Books will be bought and sold
in three categories, depending
on the condition of the book.
All prices will be based on the
current College Book Store
prices for new books.

Books in excellent condition,
with little or no underlining
will be bought at 70 per cent
of the new price and sold at 85
per cent of the price.

Books in good condition, but
with underlining and writing
will be bought at 55 per cent of
the new price and sold at 70
per cent,

Books in poor condition, with
loose binding, or a consider-
able amount of marking in
them will be bought at 40 per
cent of the new price and sold
at 55 per cent.

Miss Hansen explained that
a certain amount of mark—up is
necessary in order to operate
the coop, and hopefully to con-
tinue it as a seli~supporting,
financially independent open
ation from semester to semes-
ter.

The coop is being run by a
committee, headed by Miss
Hansen, whose members are
volunteering their time. The
other members are Bill Mohr—
man, Paul Thurston, Sue John-
son and Nord Brue.

The operation Will be an over-
thercounter, closed stack busi—
ness, at least in this first se-
mester of its operation, Miss
Hansen said. There will be no
fac' 'ties available for book

Interim Begins Today,
Offers Informal Study

Opportunities for independent
study, group discussion, and
recreation for any number
have been provided for this
year’s interim session running
today through Feb. 7.

Independent study is left to
the student, but much of the
interim time has been set aside
for lectures relating to the in-
terests and needs of the class-
es.

Sophomores are offered a se-
ries of lectures to interrelate
various subjects they have tak-
en as preparation for Junior
Liberal Arts examinations. Pro-
fessor Joseph Schwab of the
University of Chicago will
speak on "What Do Scientists
Do?" next Wednesday, “What
Do Biologists Do?” on Thurs
day, and “What Do Personality
Theorists Say?" on Friday.
These lectures will be followed
by discussions. Richard Cer-
vene (art) and Richard Howe
(music) will talk about what
professional work an artist does
outside the classroom the
morning of Feb. 1. That after-
noon James Kissane (English)
and Raymond Betts (history)
will discuss the professional
work or the humanist. Tuesday,
Feb. 2, Miss Lathrop Beale
(sociology) and Harold Fletch-
er (political science) will talk
about the work of a social sci-
entist and Beryl Clotfelter
(physics) and Guillermo Men-
doza (biology) will explain the
work of natural scientists.

For freshmen, the program
includes two parts. Wayne C.
Booth, professor of Literary
Criticism at the University of
Chicago, will give a series of
lectures on “Modern Litera-
ture as Scripture.” Tuesday,
starts the lectures with ”The
Author as Prophet." “The
Novel of Spiritual Quest" will
be given Wednesday. Thurs-
day‘s lecture, the third and last
oi the group, will be on “What
Can I Make of Such Stuff?”
or, “What to Do Until the Meta
aphysician Comes."

The second part of the fresh-
man program requiring the
reading of the Aeneid will re
late directly to Humanities I
and prepare students for Hu-
manities II and Historical Stud-
ies 1. Monday Feb. 1, Al Jones
(history) and Morris Parslow
(French) will lead discussion;
Tuesday John Crossett (classi-
cal languages) and Edward
Foster (English) will speak,

Seniors have no scheduled
lectures so that they may do—
vote their time to iinal prepara-
tion for their comprehensive
major examinations. Juniors,

 

similarly, will prepare for
their Liberal Arts examina-
tions. Both comps and the JLA
will be given Jan. 3-4.

Economist Granted
Economic $17,000

Robert H. Haveman (econom-
ics) has been awarded a $17,-
000 Brookings Institution re-
search professorship for the
1965-66 academic year.

Haveman received the grant
tor a research project entitled
“An Analysis of the Differen-
tial Impact of Alternative Pub-
lic Expenditures on the Em<
ployment of Labor, Capital, and
Regional Resources."

Haveman will be on leave
from Grinnell during the year
and will begin research on the
project in the summer of 1965.
He will be headquartered in
Washington, D. C.

Primary purpose of Have-
man’s study is to evaluate the
extent to which alternative pub-
lic expenditures draw resources
from among those who would,
in the absence of the expendi-
ture, remain unemployed,

The basic data used in the
study will be project contract
and cost information available
from public records, From this
data, the total direct and indi-
rect demands generated by the
expenditure will be obtained.
With this information, the 101-
lowing questions will be inves-
tigated in three separate
stages:

1. To what extent do the al-
ternative expenditures draw
labor from categories (skills,
occupations) displaying high
levels or unemployment?

2. To what extent do the ex-
penditures require as inputs the
outputs of industry groupings
displaying substantial excess
capacity?

3. What is the impact of the
alternative expenditures by
type and location on the utiliza<
tion of regional resources?

Haveman, a member of tho
Grinnell faculty since 1962,
holds a 1958 B. A, degree from
Calvin College and a 1963 PI],
D, from Vanderbilt University.

We're Game

We were told by last year’s staff that it we wanted to
make any innovations on the 5&3, we had better make them
right away or we’d get sidetracked by the million details in-
volved in getting out a paper every week.

We liked a lot of things about the old paper. In fact, we
kept the old nameplate. But we have made several changes
and hope to make a few more before we’re through with our
independent study.

We have a couple iiew columnists, a cartoonist, an ex-
change editor, and an editor digging through old papers for
items that could Just as easily have taken place today.

We have fine new offices in the Forum; the inner office
has cork»board walls just like the Forum lobby, and the outer
offices have a view of the construction for the science build-
ing addition to the north.

We are using the new newsprint, which, if you compare it
discerningly with the paper used in last semester’s issues,
doesn't look quite so yellow. It will be in permanent use
except for a couple weeks around the beginning of March
while the printer waits for a new shipment.

We’ve put sports on the last two pages, because that’s
where the sports editor thinks sports should be.

We have a portable tape recorder with which we hope to
do much of our intei'Vlewmg this year. You know, like US.
News and World Report and Playboy.

We have an editorial this week, but we can‘t promise one
every week. We don’t think there will be an issue of impor-
tance every week, but when something juicy comes up we
want to take plenty of time on it.

For those of you who would like to know our policy,
we will consider being more irreverent, more responsible,
more intellectual, more interesting, more vital, more unbiased,
more thorough, more provocative. But all we can promise is
that we will be more game. ..

Shades of Gray
The liberal Art

By Carl Otis Gray

it seems that nowadays the hig thing is the “how
to“ book. Helen Curley Brown, Norman Vincent
Peale, Dale Carnegie, Charles Atlas and a score of
others have set down on paper the various rules and
instructions tor making everything tram muscles to
men. Far from being on the outside at such a iast
growing enterprise, i think that Negroes should meet
the challenge of the sixties and come out with their
own “how to” book.

Although the table of Contents of such a book
would ﬁll more space than is available in this col-
umn, i'd like to brieily give a summation of one
chaptn- that; might be included. Chapter xxw—
The College Negro, it is one of the lengthy chap-
ters but of great interest to all young people at
color from Cambridge to Oxford (American ver-
sions).

"Being a Negro on campus is simply not enough,"
says What Every Young Negro Should Know. “You
must be a liberal Negro." This means many dutiful
hours of practice and patience for this great goal
cannot be achieved in one reading. “The liberal Ne«
gro is truly a thing to be admired. and in ten days
you can achieve admiration at your triends.
the adoration or your parents, and complete mas-
tery or human nature — or your money back."

First, the problem is to establish your speciﬁc
pose; there are three approaches: 1) Angry Young
Man—hate your society, protest against it, start a
young socialist league; 2) Le petit Buurgems Noir
— accept your society, become part of it 7 as

you're a Negro or not—make sure you stay on the

well, everybody counts on you to keep abreast of
the latest tunes and steps so that they can watch you
and then go to their rooms and practice in secret
until they've perfected it. Next, be curious about
things that you've never come into contact with
before—fried chicken, watermelon, Dixie Peach, and
even other Negroes! Read Ebony; chauvinism,

“Follow me. it's linals, man, but maybe we can

"Groovy.”

So we’re off, taking me shortcut across the
show through the gap between the sctence huilding
and the women’s gym. I’ve got last week’s copy
of Time under my arm and I'm making quick ret-

We're approaching the lights oi The Forum, and
we can hear the music from the jukebox through

haven't locked the doors lately, and second. they
haven’t turned the jukebox down yet.

very pretty; maybe she’d like to dance. But my
friend has spotted a girl with ratted hair, sitting

your hair?" He's shouting as he moves toward her
unaware of the people staring at him. They lnll‘O-‘

It's time for me to slip away, looking like I've

about the girl With the rotted hair. She can‘t be a
student, and I thought the Forum legion discouraged
outsiders. She must be somebody’s daughter.

“Toyl’dnd, toyland/wonderlul little girl and boy-

you visited toyland recently? 1 have an eight year
old brother for whom I wished to buy a present,
so during the vacation i found myself walking

“Why, hello there young college man," said a

“Well, yes,” i said rattler dumbiy, feeling quite

Three Sophomores to Participate

In Congressional

lIlhree sophomores, all of
them active in politics at both
"the Campus and county levels,
have been selected to partici-
pate in Grinnell College’s 1965
congressional internship pro—
gram.

The three, who will spend
this summer in Washington,
D. c., working with U. 5. con-
gressmen, are Stephen Kent,
$lephen Shender, and George
iWittgraf.

Sponsored by the college’s

ogram in Practical Political
‘ ducation, the internship pro<
ram is now in its sixth yearr

ast interns have worked with
senators, congressmen, and
pressure groups.

Each student will work with
n congressman for two months
beginning in early June and
will receive $700. They may
also have a chance to continue
their congressional work for a
“uni month after the ‘intern-
Ihip period is completed.

Kent has asked to work with
Rep. John Erlenborn, a Repub-
lican Iron-l Illinois‘ 14th (‘1 -
trict. A member of the Grin-

 

lnlern Program

nell College Young Republican

Club for two years, Kent now
serves as its treasurer, and

Esperanto Features
Vocalist Yorbrougli

Folk music will once again
ring out in the Forum when
Martin Yarbrough entertains
informally on the Esperanto
label on Saturday, January 30,
in the South Lounge. The Chi<
cago folk singer, graduate of
Old Town’s “Mother Blues,"
will present two varied per-
formances at 9:30 and ”iii

Yarbrough will appear under
the auspices of Grinnell’s Es-
peranto series, inaugurated last
year to provide professional
and semi-professional enter-
tainment with an emphasis on
variety.

Responsible for Esperanto’s
organization, the 19-member
student F or u in Committee
stresses its informality and
freedom from dating obliga-
tions. “Enthusiasm is high on
the part of the committee for
they see Esperanto as a way
to offer a wide assortment of
performers to the campus with
in the scope of their budget,"
noted Palmer Hartl, social co-
ordinator.

By remaining sensitive to
student opinion and suggesr
tions, the Committee hopes to
season Esperanto and to con-
tinue to bring off-campus en-
tertainment to the college com
munity.

Esperanto performances will
be scheduled about once a
month. Informal entertainment
by Grinnell students under this
program is a distinct possibil-

 

ity in the near future.

Slide Lecture on IVS Tells Students
Aid Needed for Underdeveloped Lands

By Anne Farrer

As most Grinnellians are
probably fully aware, when at-
tending a lecture in student has
to gain understanding of the
topic under consideration by
flexing his imagination more
than by observing physically
active evidence. Not so last
January 12 during a discussion
of foreign service and practi-
cal people to people programs
which was held in the Viewing
room. During the course of
events, one integral part of
which was viewing slides, the
slide feeding mechanism of the
projector went on the blink and
for all practical purposes any
further slide showing was prfit.
Did anyone give up? Did any
lose heart? Certainly not. Two
strong and ablerbodied former
Peace Corpsmen came to the
rescue and keeping in the spirit
of their parent organization and
really showing their stuff, de-
vised a way to manually feed
the slides and proceeded to do
it, So on with the lecture:

Leading the proceedings was
Msgr. Edward O'Rourke of Des
Moines, president of the board
of directors of International
Voluntary Services. He dis-
cussed the organization, which
was founded in 1953 and Was a
forerunner of the Peace Corps,
and its purpose to “develop hur
man resources.” IVS now has
several hundred volunteers in
the field in twelve underdevel-
oped countries, giving technical
assistance and working to bring
the people together to work
out their problems. Real sucA
cess for an IVSrer is achieved
if he can work himself out of
a job—if he can so stimulate

 

the natives to take over his
activity and continue on with
their own development.

The concept behind IVS is the
same as that behind the Peace
Corps: after World War II the
US was quite successful with
its rehabilitation program for
warrdevastated countries, but
found that trying to apply the
same policies to countries
which haven't attained the
same advanced level as those
countries of Western Europe is
a bit ridiculous: What was
needed is a practical program
of economic, technical, and
practical aid. IVS recruits and
sends out people to meet this
need—vigorous, personable, in—
telligent volunteers who ident-
ify with, live with, and help the
people of raw underdeveloped
countries They are ”agents of
change”—by their work they
are changing the image of
America abroad, the concept of
foreign aid, and themselves
personally. It is in this latter
respect that Msgr. O’Rourke
believes that the abilities and.
experience of volunteers—1V5,
Peace Corps or whatever—can
be most fully Utilized. Their
services need not end with their
work in a foreign country, for
when returning to the States
they can form a reserve of
leadership which could be val-
uable in many areas, from civ-
il rights to urban renewall

Msgr. O'Rourke’s talk was
followed by Ann Wright, Grin-
net] ’62 and IVS in Viet Nam,
and Tom Kenwortby, Peace
Corps in Colombia, discussing
their respective programs and

lCEP Internships
For Week in 0.6.

One-week political internships in
Washington, no, in a year which
promises to be an exciting one in
the nation‘s capital are now open
to 16 Iowa college students through
the Iowa Center for Education in
Politics (ICEP).

Applications for the awards,
which are equivalent to travel ex-
penses for the trip to Washington,

hosts — three members of the
Iowa congressional delegation—at-
tend sessions of Congress and com—
mittee hearings, visit national po-
litical party headquarters, and
meet Congressional, party and gov-
ernmental leaders and officials.
The Democratic and Republican

experiences. An interesting
point brought up by Miss Wright
was that of the relationship be-
tween the Communist guerrillas
and IVS Volunteers in Viet
Nam. There is an unwritten
agreement that the Red ver
hicles that IVSrers travel in are
left alone' by the Viet Cong.
in comparing the two agencies
the idea was advanced that the
larger, more publicized, gov'
ernment sponsored Peace Corps
may be becoming a sacred cow,

Whereas the IVS with its small- ~

er, private organization might
decrease its effectlveness if it
expanded too much. At any
rate both programs, each per-
forming a service—to the mar
derdeveloped countries and the
U. s.—are striving toward the
same end, with the Peace
Corps figuratively taking the
high road and [VS the low.

The committee has asked that
only students who have books
to sell some on the first day.

Students who bring hooks to
sell will be given a numbered
receipt showing the name of
the book, the student, and the
amount that will be paid for the
book.

When the book is sold the stu-
dent will be sent a notice to
come and pick up his money.
It the book is not sold by the
time that the coop closes for
the semester, the student will
be sent a notice to pick up his
book.

The coop will start operating
on a small loan, of about $20.00
from the Student Government
Association, but the loan will
be repaid with no interest when
the coop closes for the semes-
ter. The rest of the margin,
which the coop hopes to make,
will be deposited in an inde-
pendent fund for use when it
sets up its operation for the
first semester of the 1965-66
school year.

Phil Johnson, SGA President.
said that the administration of
the college is cooperative with
the project and has provided
the room for it to set up its
operation.

Amendments to SGA Constitution Explained

Ed. note: The following is an
explanation of What SGA hopes
will be accomplished by initiat-
ing several constitutional amend
ments. The article was written
by Dan Bucks, a member of the
committee which drew up the
amendments.

Student government has often
been a irustrating experience for
those who have served on one of
the many student boards or com-
mittees. Hopefully, though, a ma-
jor source of that frustration -—
the cumbersome checksand-bal-
ance system on which the present
SGA is based — would be allevi-
ated by proposed amendments to
the SGA constitution, which were
recently given a nearly unanimous
vote of approval by the Student
Senate

Ideas ror changing the present
government were iirst discussed
earlier this term at the encamp-
ment. This discussion of reorgani-
zation was continued by a com-
mittee formed by the Executive
Cabinet. All of the meetings of this

 

group were open to students. and

carton!

several took advantage of the op-
portunity to voice their views on
student government. The new pro
posals were a product of the spe-
cial committee.
The major theme of the proposed
amendments is centralization and
simplification. Under the plan,
executive and legislative functions
would no longer be separated.
That much maligned body, the
Student Senate, would be replaced
by a smaller group, the Advisory
Council, comprised of one repre-
sentative per hall, the AWS Board
President, the CotHP President,
and the SGA President, who would
serve as chairman of the organi-
zation. At present, there are 41
Senators. The new body would
have 21 members. In practice, the
smaller size would allow the group
to function in a committee-like at-
mosphere, in contrast to the pres-
ent Senate meetings often ham»
pered hy its size, which necessi-
tates formal parliamentary meth-
ods. Opinion articulation and de-
cision»making will be aided by the
less formal meetings.

Actually, the Advisory Council

would be comparable to an an.
larged version of the present
Executive Cabinet. Currently, the
Student Senate usually has formal
proposals submitted to it which it
can either approve or disapprove.
This action is then subject to veto
by the Executive Cabinet. The Ad
visory Council, it is hoped, would
play a greater part in shaping
new proposals than what the
Senate has been able to play.
Moreover, since the Executive
Cabinet would be included as vut—
ing and speaking members of the
Council, the Cabinet vem would be
eliminated for the constitution.

As chairman of the Advisory
Council, the SGA President would
assume the duties of the Speaker
of the Senate. This change would
eliminate the disruption and (load
lock of student government that
has occurred in previous years be
cause of conflict" between the
Speaker and the SGA President.

Another major innovation would
glve the Coil-[P and AWS Board,

record to four wins and one defeat in conference play. I
hasten to add a word of caution, however, to those avid
iollowers of the Hawkeyes to “keep their heads." I have
been trying for three years to determine the point where
the Iowa fan’s rationale terminates' and fanatacism com-
mences, and I believe it is when the team goes one game
above the .500 mark with at least two-thirds of the season
left.

Even an outsider can’t help but admire new Coach Ralph
Miller, however, for the job he has done at Iowa City in less
than a year. He immediately took one step in the right direc-
tion when he wound up with only two of his first six players
irom Iowa (two are froln Illinois, one from New Jersey and
one from Michigan]. The reasoning here is obvious; the compe-
tition in the Big Ten is stiff and basketball talent sufficient
to compete is lacking in the Iowa high school ranks. The only
way in which Iowa can be a consistent Winner is by importing
players from basketball-rich states such as Illinois and In-
diana.

I am not here to discuss the merits of out-of-state re-
cruiting, or the possibilities for Iowa‘s basketball future but,
rather, to dispel those dreams of a Big Ten championship
this year. Let us look at the record so far. They have won
four Big Ten games: two over Michigan State, one over Wis-
consin, and one over Indiana. There was nothing unusual
about the first three victories except the score of the second
Michigan State game. In the first half of that game Iowa shot
a rousing 54% while State was hitting at less than a 25% clip.
The Indiana game was truly an upset since it was on Indiana’s
home court. Again, however, their opponents had a cold night
as Indiana had bagged only 20 points at halftime.

In short, although this is a good team, it will take
quite a bit more proof before most outsiders will predict any~
thing above a fifth place finish for this Iowa outfit. To those
cries of, “Bring on U.C.L.A.” and “Bring on Michigan," they
will get their chance on January 29 and February 8. Let’s
discuss it again after those games.

Eugene Thompson asked the house
presidents to see that the dis-
placed oif—campus residents of
INS Park St. get north campus
rooms that are in line with their
class Standing.

Under this plan, freshmen liv-
ing alone in doubles could be
asked to take a different room if
his room were requested by 1019
residents. Other necessary rear-
rangements would also be con-
sidered.

The 1019 men will return to north
campus at their convenience dur‘
ing the interim Session.
Thompson also relayed a mes-
sage from Forum Director Mrs.
Jewell Hawk. He noted that Mrs.
Hawk has been concerned over
the “general sluppiness" of Forum-
goers, especially in the use of
cigarettes. Thompson said that
more ashtrays will be made avail-
able shortly. *
Thompson commented on stu-
dent courts, saying that the mag-
istrates don't seem to have the
same view of their job as do stu-
dent government officials. l-le al-
so commented, “I don't under-
stand it, but the student judges
seem to like their jobs."

Thompson said he holds hope
that the present court setup will
give way [0 more informal court
sessions. He concluded that no
matter what the setup, there will
always be some cases that just
can't be handled by student courts
and that in the end, “We may have
to depend on good will.”

In other business, Pete Read,

an analysis of CofHP election pro-

from the CofHP‘s Buildings and
Grounds comminee, a) a meeting
of the CDIHP with the Faculty
Committee on Student Affairs, and
4) a revision of the student hand-

Tankers to Resume
Season Against Coe

Grinnell College's swimmers will
open a four-meet home stand by
hosting the cue Kohawks at 1:30
pm. tomorrow in the college pool.

The meet is the first in nearly a
month and a half for Coach lrv
Simone's Pioneers. They have
shown marked improvement dur-
ing practice sessions during that
span and simone feels they are
ready both physically and mental-
ly for the fast-paced, rugged sche-
dule ahead.

The development of added depth
has been one of the features of the
long break from action and Simone
feels he has 10 men capable of
finishing high in the points in their
events. They are:

Lettermen —- Roger Abendroth,
diving; Tony Horton, backstroke
and sprints; John Kraai, breast-
stroke and individual medley;
Ralph Pray, distance; and Howard
Schein, sprints.

Sophomores Ken Adelrnan,
butterlly; Richard Lance diving
and sprints; Ray L a n g h a m,
sprints: Bill Lontz. sprints and
breaststroke; and Charles Schnell,
distance.

Grinnell will take a H) dual meet
mark into the cue engagement. The
Pioneers topped Augustana 5340
with Pray winning both distance
events and Adelman and Horton
capturing their specialties, the 200-
yard butterfly and zoo-yard hack»
stroke. The AOO-yard medley tour-
same of Horton, Kraai, Adelman,
and Schein also came in ﬁrst.

The medley crew also tapped the
field at the Knox Relays, setting a
new meet record.

Born in Rodeo, Cant, in 1910,
Gomez broke into organized
baseball in 1928 with Salt Lake
City of the Utah—Idaho League.

He won 13 and lost 11 with
San Francisco of the Pacific
League in 1929 and was sold

Hoping to Cure Second Half Slump,
Cagers Scheduled for Practice Only

A recent scoring drought
triggered by second half slumps
will be the main problem
Coach John Pfitsch Will attempt
to correct during Grinnell’s 3—
week semester test and interim
study break.

’The Pioneer cagers, who are
idle until meeting Augustana
(lll.) on Jan. 30 in a non-con-
ference game, will practice
only about one hour a day dur-
ing the break. Offense will be
the main order of the practice
sessions because of a disastrous
road trip to Minnesota last

weekend that resulted in 19-
and 20»polnt setbacks.

Boasting an 84.5-point aver-
age before the trip, the Pio-
neers saw their point produc-
tion plunge in an 83764 loss to
St. Olaf and an 88-63 defeat to
Carleton.

Successfully slowing down
Grinnell’s pressing, run and
gun game, the Oles and Carls
limited the Piitschmen to 69
and 75 shots. Only once before
had the Scarlet and Black been
held to less than 80 shots.

A second half slump was the
chief villain in each outing.
Ahead only 33732 at the inter—
mission, St. Olaf surged to its
easy win on 67 per cent firing
in the final 20 minutes. At Carl-
eton, the Pioneers could shoot
only 25 per cent after trailing
but 4039 at the midway point.

“Lack of offensive poise,"
Was the way Pfitsch described
it. The sophomore and junior
dominated Pioneers were un—
able to regroup forces and turn
the tide of battle when the vet
eran Oies and Carls began pull-
ing away, he explained.

 

Despite giving up 171 points
in the two outings, Pfitsch felt
Grinnell’s defense was respeCt-
able.

”But, we have got to develop
more offensive poise," he reit-
erated.

Now 3-5 for the campaign
and 273 in the Midwest Confer<
ence, the Pioneers have out<
scored opponents 642-638 and
boast five men in double fig-
ures.

Guard Jeff Frantz is the top
pointmaker with 163 for a 21.0
average. 46- and 37-point
splurges in two games figure
prominently in his total.

Frantz also tops the team in
the rebounding department with
66. Bunched closely behind
Frantz in scoring are center
Jim Rhodes. 93 points and an
11.6 average; guard Elliott
Hibbs 91 points and. an 11.4
average; forward Tom Hill,
89 points and an 11.! average;
and forward - center Clyde
Smith, 81 points and a 10.1 av-
erage.

Forward Ted Risser has
notched 63 markers for a 7.9
average.

Rhodes and Smith rank close
to Frantz in rebounding with
GI) and 57, respectively.

uate study in business compiled
