N0 GRADES
AT ANTIOCH

YELLOW SPRINGS, Ohio
(CPS) — The faculty of Antioch
College has voted to abolish
grades, and replace them with
a “credit/no credit” system of
evaluating students’ work

At present Antioch has an
A—B~C—D-F grading scale. The
new system, which was ap-
proved hy the faculty May 7,
requires faculty to give fairly
detailed reports on the progresl
of students in addition to as
signing them “credit or no
credit” for courses.

The new plan was the result
of a two-year study by the edu<
cational policy committee,
which was headed by Mrs. Ruth
Churchill, director of testing at
Antioch.

According to Mrs. Churchill,
the details of the new evaluation
system are still being worked
out: by her committee. She says.
though, that faculty will be able
to give comments on students.
and also note their progress in
the following six areas: skills
and techniques, substantive
learning, creative thinking. in-
dependent thinklng. quantity of
work and responsibility.

Editorial . . .

TRADITIONS

We, the undersigned members of the Grinnell College class of
1968, will not wear caps and gowns to any of the ceremonies re-
lated to graduation for one or more of the following reasons:

1. In the tradition of liberal education we will not accept tradi-
tional actions without rational justification. No reason has been
advanced as to why this dress is necessary.

2. We consider institutional pomp meaningless.

ii. We object to enforced uniform dress.

4. We object to the exclusion of student voice in the decision
of this issue as implied by late notification.

5. $3.75

6. We object to bookstore monopoly. .

7. We consider such dress uncomfortable. inappropriate to the
Iowa climate, and restrictive.

Now that you’ve seen the petition, let's talk about it. Permit
me to take the points out of order.

Point 7 seems to have an immediate solution. Wear shoes.
rocks or stockings, the gown, and nothing else. It's really very
comfortable, and not exactly restrictive either. As far as appro-
priateness to the climate, if somebody has found garments suitable
for wear in tornadoes, let him step forward.

To those people who objected to gi ng ,_ 75 to Smilin’ Sam’s
ovil monopoly i say why not entertain competitive bids? We had
competitive commencement announcements — why didn’t you or
ganize and undersell the bookstore? Dr rent your cup and gown
elsewhere?

Point one: oh, contradiction of contndictionsl How can you
call upon the TRADITION of liberal education to explain nonac-
ceptanco of TRADITIONAL actions? If you still feel compelled by
this point, I would suggest n short session with Mr. crossett. I
ihinlr you will find that although you might be justified in not
wearing a cap and gown, you won’t easily find justification for
doing much else.

I can find no provisions for enforcing uniform dress. Did you?
By student voice, i presume you are speaking of the collective
student. I’m sure that individual students still do have a voice in
what they wear simply by not wearing the cap and gown.

And, by the way, if you consider institutional pomp meaning-
less, why are you going to commencement anyway? Let's just
piclr up our degrees afterward.

Rut here's the real scoop on commencement. Just like every-
thing else at Grinnell, it’s not for the students. It's a fascist ma«
nipulative plat to get money from alumni and friends of the Col-

lege. You see all those caps and gowns disguise us, and remind the
alums of what they looked like, and stirs memories and things
and they cross Glenn’s palm with silver. Now, I risk you, is this
bad?

Since this protest is being staged by graduating seniors, sev-
eral assumptions must be made. We candidates for the BA. have
been here up to four years — we‘ve stuck it out, To stick it out,
you must fall into one of these categories: I-you couldn’t get out;
2-you are a masochist; 3»you liked it.

To the iirst, i say wait five minutes and it will all go away,
like a nightmare. To the second, I say enjoy, you perverts. To the
third 1 make my plea.

If you liked it, there's n good chance you would want your
younger brothers and sisters, or your children, to come here.
They can't it the college doesn’t get coin. Because if it doesn't
get coin, it will ily nwny train the world. So . . . wear your cups
and gowns, turn on the alumn, get that cold cash rolling iii.

If you feel the need to communicate to our President your
sincere concerns about our old folks’ home, I’m sure a discreet
button, or perhaps a few choice words as he welcomes you to the
world of the alum,‘ will do magmilcentiy.‘

MONEY AND INK

Yes, this is on salt. No, Neil didn’t use up all the money. Yes,
he thought he had.

Seems that Steve (Business Manager) Wal'sh let the mock
convention people borrow his adding machine, and he was totaling
bills in his head. Turns out he counted a bill for over $300 twice,
and in the final accounting, he found we had some loot left.

Meanwhile. Neil had already planned to leave before com-
mencement, and the new editor hasn’t been named yet, so here I
and again.

I wish I had had more time to work on this issue, and a staff
to assist me. But finals week is a bad time to start anything. ex<
cept maybe studying.

I would like to know where Bill Gray put his column because
I Couldn't ﬁnd it. I wish J. R had come through wit-ii what prom-
ised to be a very good feature.

Great thanks go out to Roger (he’s everywhere, he’s every-
where) McMullin, Information Service News Director, for his
service in directing me to infomation and news. And iivo skins
are due the multifaceted Mike Schwartz for his caricatures.

I'd like to say more, but I have to hurry over to commence-
merit. I’m first in line, and as Mr. Mendoza said, “you can make
ll 01‘ break it."

I’m going to try to make it. If I don’t, keep it to yourself. I’m
an alumnus now.‘

NOTES FROM THE
OlROlllJlR FILE

A few recent sessions in the Des Moines Airport have convinced
me that something must be done to protect students flying standby
from being bumped off waiting lists by men ﬂying military stand-
by.

After iili, isn’t that favoring the right-wing-military-industrial—
complex? It seems to me that student activists ought to be given
the same privileges as military men.

of course, the same restrictions would apply to the activists.
They would have to be in uniform.

since activist uniforms are rather easy to come by, our new
ﬂying elite would be required to produce orders requiring them to
travel (a note from S.D.S. headquarters would do).

I’m sure that this move would put a little spice into the his
line business, although we might have to get a Supreme Court rul<
big prohibiting the airlines from releasing the contents or the
orders.

LEGGETT ANSWERS
CAP AND GOWN PROTESTORS

[is several of you know, and as most of you may know,
Wednesday noon 1 was given ii statement, signed by some 63
members of the graduating class, to the effect that they “will not
wear caps and gowns to any of the ceremonies related to gradlk
ntion for one or more of the following reasons:" The reasons, or
objections, are essentially that the wearing of cap and gown is
meaningless, expensive, uncomfortable, and undemocratic. As
far as the College is concerned, these objections — which may or
may not be true — are n matler of individual judgment and value.
Certainly, except for the remarks of the invited commencement
speaker, the graduation ceremony is a ritual, traditional pomp
and circumstance; and participation in it is not a condition or
whether or not h graduating senior gets his diploma.

Accordingly, any graduating senior who finds the ceremony
meaningless or offensive or inconvenient Should exercise his privi-
lege not to participate in it, but rather attend as a spectator or not
attend at all; and then obtain ills diploma alter the ceremony
from the College Marshal, Professor Mendoza. The solution seems
very simple to me. Believing that everyone knew that Commence-
ment was a ritual chielly designed for tile parents and friends or
graduating seniors, I am puzzled only by the question of why
these matters cannot be approached with a sense of humor and
a good natured attempt at understanding.

PREXY OBITS
OVER FOUR-
LETTER WORDS

TALLAHASSE, Fla. (CPS)<
Florida State University Presl-
deiit John Champion resigned
this week in the wake of a cen~
sorship dispum over the use of
four letter words in the campus
literary magazine, but the board
of regents has refused to accept
the resignation.

Champion resigned after the
arts and sciences faculty, rep<
resenting the largest college in
the university, held a special
meeting to discuss the admin-
istration’s censorship or student
publications. The faculty tabled
by a vote oi 175-165 a motion to
censure the president and de-
mand his resignation if lie would
not reverse his decision to cen-
sor an article written for the
Legend, the literary magazine.

The president announced his
resignation only 30 minutes at-
ter the faculty voile. “In view of

this sentiment, i hereby tender
my resignation, effective im.
mediately," he said, His state
ment also said, “it is evident
that I no longer enjoy the con-
fidence of a major segment of
this university faculty.”

The Florida board of regents,
however, held an emergency
meeting and refused to accept
Champion’s resignation, Cham-
pion has not responded to the
board’s action, but many ob-
servers think he will make his
resignation stick. Others say
he can be persuaded to stay.

Three of Champion’s assist-
ants resigned along with him.
They were the director or uni-
versity relations and two spe-
cial assistants to the president.

According to rules set by the
board of regents, Champion is
responsible for all student pub-
lications. He had announced his
decision the day before the sp6<
cial faculty nicedng not to let
a controversial short story en-
titled “Pig Knife," appear in the
literary magazine. The short
story is about two uneducated
Negroes who use a variety of
iour letter words, on a limited
basis, in their conversation.

Champion labeled the article
“filthy and obscene." The board
of student publications earlier
had cleared the article for publi-
cation because of its literary
Value. The board held that the
four letter words added to ma
mood and tone of the story.

Hundreds of students have pro-
tested against the censorship.
Before Champion announced his
final decision, the students held
a 24—hour-a-day vigil in iront ot
the administration building to
await his announcement. After
Champion‘s resignation, Acting
President Laurence Chalmers
appointed a student-faculty com-
mittee tn study the publications
regulations set by the Regents
and make proposals for revi-
sions. The students called a
moratorium on their protest to
await the committee’s report,
which is due next week.

Kurtz Calls For Social Awareness

This is a letter of greeting to
colleagues and students, espe-
cially to all those we should
have written and have not, and
to those we haven't written re-
cently enough. i realized today
that your semester is virtually
over and that I would like to
communicate with you beiore
it was all over.

This year in Liberia has gone
well for us, The students and I
could be happier with the re-
sults at my teaching; i believe,
though, utat teaching the so.
cial sciences in the developing
countries is a valuable enter<
prise. l have. done some re-
search and am preparing tor

pological activity 1 am looking
forward to Mrs. Kurtz has
been working in the Registrar's
Oiiice this year, but will be
teaching next year. The chil-
dren, Gordon and Jeremy, are
thriving tor the most part.

As always, there is no short-
age oi appalling things in our
world. Some of you have read
or heard about our Christmas
letter, telling ot the awiul pov-
erty of Liberia, Though the
tone of that letter was person-
al, the intention of it was to
point out the folly of our gov-
ernment‘s actions in Vietnam,
when the world so profoundly
cried ier other kinds of efforts
And now, with the candidacies
oi McCarthy and of Kennedy
for the Democrats, the with-
drawal of Johnson, the begin-
nings of peace—talks: now,
when there is again a ray of
hope, let us express some re—
lated thoughts, from the per.
spective of this remote location.

I am appalled at the human
poverty in the developing
countries of parts of Africa;
but I am equally or more ap-
palled at the poverty ot hu-
mane thought and action in the
developed countries. 1 have a
continuing hope that certain
ideals of democratic human-
ism, tolerance, accommodation,
respect for others and their
views. and the necessity of hu-
man rights tor all men, might
prevail in a modernizing world
of potentially universal afflu-
ence. America. though, has
given me little cause to main-
tain that hope. I have seen.
from the perspective of Airica,
my country, excessively proud,
intolerant, and narrowly single-
minded, standing as the World's
greatest threat to world peace.
The real iaults possessed by Ho
and the Viet Cong have ap-
peared insignificant to us, to
the Vietnamese, and to the
world, when compared with
our war eifort. Yet we engaged
In this effort in the name of all
those humanistic principles
which we valued, adding hypoc-
risy and untruth to our errors
of execution. And it is not yet
clear to me with what spirit we
are planning to approach the
peace table.

I have long felt that there
were teasihle peace proposals
— reasonable alternatives to
war; that the only way we
could gain honor was to cease
the war; and that there were
countless other subjects more
worthy of our commitments,

for example, zo million Ameri-
can Negroes, our natural erla
vironment, our cities. the pov-
ertysstricken majority of the
world, the United Nations, all
of which we have neglected
shameiully, Yet, i have not de-
spaired of my country. although
I often despaired totally oi the
present leadership. And I con-
tinue to despair of those deci-
sion making elites, making bad
decision alter bad decision, who
are operating more and more
freely outside the weakening
controls of democratic institu-
tions. Even it you argue that
our involvement in Vietnam is
less an “arrogance oi power"
than the malfunctioning oi a
decision~making process, you
must agree that either imputed
cause a the real arrogance and
the clear maliunction — cannot
be etiectively corrected with
the present political and ad-
ministrative personnel. Even
with Johnson stepping down,
we must insure a real change
in leadership. By a move to-
ward peace in one area, we do
not thereby alter the country's
stated position on waging the
war in the iirst place. Our
toreign aid poiicy, our interna-
tional stance, our entire exter-
nal View must be removed, If
we did so, maybe we could
then do more than simply play
with making over our society
internally,

Dissent on the question or
our war is completely le
mate and urgently desirable,
Even it peace negotiations
break down now, we should re«
sist the war as strongly as we
can; we should support strong-
ly those political candidates
who hold out some hope of in-
troducing a humanistic and
realistic perspective on the
Vietnam conﬂict and the peace
negotiations, as well as on our
position in the world at large
(which includes China). I am
not sure what more can he
done than to work for the man
who can promise, not merely a
way out or Vietnam, but a new
way of looking at the world At

"I believe the so-called re-
volutionaries on college cam-
poses are small in number. A!
the same time, a far larger
number of students are dis-
enchanted with society and with
education in a very diiiei-ent
way, This latter group is willing
to work for a change within the

become triends and advocates
or social transiormation where-
ever our society demands it.
Should the war continue, 1
would be unable to decide how
tar i could advocate or advise
you to refuse to tight in it. l
think, however, that there
should certainly be multiple
bases for conscientious objec-
tioll in our society.

Finally, those of you who are
already in the intellectual tra-
dition and those or you who
will go into it should consider
whether the scholarly commu-
nity really should have opted
out of the political arena in
the United States. Theodore
Roszak has written an article
called “The Complacencies of
the Academy": “(To the philos-
ophers oi the eighteenth cen—
tury enlightenment) the intel-
lectual was one who intervened
in society for the deiense of
civilized values wherever they
were threatened; one who clar-
iiied reality so that his fellow
citizens could reason toward
the solution of their problems,"
And he goes on to note that the
level oi political dialogue might
be dominated by more than
slogans, cynicism, and “engi-
neered consensus" if intellec-
tuals were established as con-
tinuous and expected partners
to major civic controversy, in-
stead of as lonely, occasional,
and unexpected dissidents, to
he laughed out of court by
Philislines.

Social structurally, of course,
it is much more difficult to do
this in modem industrial so-
ciety than it was during the
Enlightenment; it is difficult
to be creatively dissident with
in a bureaucracy of the dimen-
sions required by industrial so-
ciety. Such an observation
should stand as a challenge to
us and not as an excuse for
despair; a challenge. that is,
to the creative and innovative
among the young leaders to
work out new means, appro-
priate to modern society, for
entering into political dialogue,
of transcending the bureaucra-
cies. There is a unique chance
in the present era to conscious-
ly experiment with the most
effective means of entering in-
to civic controversy. Perhaps
new forms will evolve which
will recall or preserve the
ideals of 18th century intellec-
tnai life — or perhaps the ideal
life of the intellectual at any
time. The evolutionary process
is probably already at work;
it may he that I simply do not
know what the eiiective groups
and movements are. Whatever
the case. i urge that you be«
come a part of them and, as
intellectual leaders of such
groups, help to shape them into
instruments which can effec-
tively defend humanistic values
whenever and wherever they
are threatened.

The right to speak out freely
on questions is a right that
must never be taken for grant-
ed. It must be cherished, de-
fended, and lovingly nourished
by its continuous exercises Best
wishes to all of you from Ll-
heria.

"CHANGE IN THE MAKING"— BRILLIANT COMEDY

ANIMAL
BEHAVIOUR

Tho notorious Mr. Gait, or
Ray, or whatever, hasn't been
captured yet, but the Asso-
ciated Press noted a few day:
ago that, supposedly before he
fled Memphis, he supposedly
made a long-distance telephone
call to the lngall’s Shipyards
in Pascagoula, Miss. The Beloit
College Roundtable — in a May
9 followup on the 5&B’s expose
or President Leggett's nprll
trip to Longfellow House, a
posh, discriminatory hotel-mo—
tel in Pascagoula — noted that
Longfellow House is owned by

be lngall's Shipyards, which is
division of Litton Industries.

TODAY lN HISTORY: it
was just eight months ago to-
day that President Leggelt told
an open senate meeting in
ARH that he advocated “a con-

ting more upperclass students
to live oil-campus in either pri—
vate homes or apartments...
the option for upperclassmen
who do not choose to abide by
college social regulations to
find oil-campus housing and
abide by whatever regulations
meir landlords or the Commu-
nity or Grinnell imposes.” Jun-
iors next year will doubtless
remember that bit or presi-

smrr FILM CRITIC

Among recent films, “Bonnie
and Clyde" is probably the
most imaginative in its use at
the medium, “The Graduate"
is surely the most sensitive ex-

plorntlon oi the spiritual
agonies oi young people mov-
ing from college into a iraudu-
lent world. “Change in the
Making,” a lowrbudget, inde-
pendently produced sleeper I
happened to see last week,
may be the best recent exam-
ple irom the film genre which
spoofs college liie, though per-
haps not as funny as the Marx
Brothers’ classic “Horse Feath-
ers.”

The college, of course, is a
s or all, coeducational liberal
arts college in the middle west.
The form is imaginative: 't is
a pseudodocumentary — the
sort of thing one can imagine
some slightly desperate college
actually using for promotional
purposes, All of the cliches are
there.

ln the beginning, the camera
moves from a pastoral land-
scape to a long study of the
tall, handsome Athlete in bi!

letter jacket and his leggy
Beauty Queen girl friend, hand
in hand, returning down the
railroad tracks to their cam-
pus, having been God knows
where.

During the Course of the film,
we are given to understand
that such a place is populated
chietly by kindly preceptors
over 80, and by other Beauty
Queens; that the autumn ritual
of football playing and Queen
crowning is still taken serious-
ly by a considerable number
of students; that learning con-
sists very largely of manipu-
lating a r n a n e paraphernalia
which have been devised by
electronics engineering with
s t r o n g propensities towards
witchcrait; that the sylvan set-
ting or such a place somehow
has a steadying effect on the
twitchy nervous systems of
young people engaged in the
inchoale rite of passage our
culture prescribes; and other
nonsense.

Most of the actors are ob-
viously amateurs, but, true to
the tradition of the old movies
in which Walter Winchell play-
ed Walter Winchell, Peter
Hackes plays Peter Hackes. it
is a brilliant Stroke; the husky-
voiced Mr. Hackes has made
his name reporting about
spacecraft, and the space age’s
cliches about liberal learning,
broadcast over the mass media.
are surely a different matter
from earlier pietier communi-
cated in more primitive ways.
Hackes utters them with a sol-
emn pomposity which gives
ballast to the comic strategy
of the film

For a climax to the film, the
writers have invented a hilari-
ous sequence in which practic-
cally all of the great ones of

the intellectual community con-
verge on this remote spot,
heatedly discuss weighty mat-
ters for two or three days, ass
cept their rewards —- honorary
degrees — and depart. “These
were the three most important
days in the college’s history,"
we hear Hackes say sententb
ously. (The Lord help us all,
there might be college people
nowadays who actually believe
this; or there might be col-
leges that are so poverty-strick-
en intellectually, that this
might be true or them.)

All or this, naturally, is In
technicolor; the low»budget pro-
ducers knew better than to
skimp here. (Think how incom-
plete the joke would have been,
in black and white.) Best of
all. however, is the almost in-
penetraole dead pan which
masks this presentation

Almost impenetrable. Per-
haps the film is slightly ilawed
in that the mask is allowed
sometimes to slip, to make very
clear to the drowsy viewer that
he is watching a parody, and
not the real thing. in one of
the great comic scenes, some
students are shown looking at
a painting; but at ahout the
moment when one might ex-
pect them to have deciphered
its mysteries, two men, appar-
ently from the ﬁnance com-
pany, come along and haul the
painting away. During the loot
ball scene, while Hackes’s
voice is telling us about the
"excited tans,” the camera is
showing us six mini—skirted
cheerleaders irentically trying
to arouse the fans, while from
the stands comes —— absolute
lilence.

The most subtle joke of the
tilm, perhaps, shows an incred-
ibly beautiful coed, in I pose

ture of introspection, whllo
Hackes's voice simulates the
run of her meditations; just all
the is beginning to ask herself
- you guessed it: “Who Am
I?”.— the camera contrives to
blur the perfect lines oi her
nose into a bulbous blob.

Perhaps some or the humor
is too occult: probably only the
relatively small circle oi people
who follow the talents of Ann
Kirschner and Dru McCon-
aughy know from tho twinkle
with which they sing the sac-
charine lyrics or “The Happy
Song" that they aren’t buying
its Hubert Humphrey Pollyan-
naism; the camera, however,
illustrates the lyrics literally,
complete with a happy little
squirrel in a happy old elm
tree.

The boldest stroke oi the dls
rector was to photograph this
film on location at Glinnell Cole
lege, in Iowa, and then to ao<
tually call the college “Grin-
nell.” I don’t know enough
about the law oi libel and slanv
der to assess the degree of his
liability, though i can imagine
an irate alumnus, having spent
money in ﬁve iigures and en-
ergy in millions oi ergs in on
der to win a degree from this
college, suing the producers
for making that degree an obs
ject of ridicule. They’re repom
edly good students out there
however, and Will probably}
take this film in the spirit at
Iun In which it was made 01
perhaps, remembering Nous
Dame, the producers hope for
the publicity that a law suit
can bring, tor minors along the
Rialto have it that none of th!
big distributors have bought
this splendid motion picture.
The more’s the pity.

licer in the Foreign Service.

President Leggett will preside
over the commencement cere-
monies, assisted by Robert N.
Noyce, chairman of the Board
of Trustees, and James H.
Stauss, provost and dean oi the
college.

"Grinnell Processionals," an
original composition by Paul
M. Zonn (music), will be given
its premiere performance at the
commencement program. The
piece, which was commissioned
by the college, is arranged tor
woodwind, brass, and percus-
sion.

The 1953 recipient oi the
Newcomb Cleveland Prize oi
the American Association {or
the Advancement ot Science,
Dr. Commoner has been an
active investigator oi lunda-
mental problems on the physio-
chemical basis oi biological
processes. His laboratory has
conducted pioneer studies on
iree radicals in biological sysr
hems and on the mechanisms by
which viruses are duplicated in
the cell. He has also proposed

a radical new view on the
chemical basis of inheritance.

A member of the board of
directors of the American As<
socialion tor the Advancement
of Science, Dr. Commoner also
serves on the organization’s
Committee On Council Affairs
and was chairman of the Coma
mittee on Science in the Pro-
motion of Human Welfare in
1960-66.

He is a iounder oi the St.
Louis Committee ior Nuclear
lniormation and served as its
president in 196565.

Dr. Commoner is also co-
chairman of the Scientists' In-
stitute tor Public Iniormaiion,
a member oi the board oi gov-
ernors ot the American Institute

ber oi the National Tuberculo<
sis Association Air Conservation
Commission, and a member of
the advisory board of Sciatica
Year.

l-lis deep interest in the in-
teraction between science and
social problems is enumerated
in “Science and Survival,” a
book published in 1966. The
book documents the serious
threats to human survival that
results from modern technologi-
cal changes, and the resultant
responsibilities of scientists and
citizens.

Dr. Commoner holds a B.A.
degree trom Columbia Univer-
Iity and M.A. and PhD. degrees

SHARE TOILET
WITH 6.12 GIRLS?

by the Sims
Do—lt-Yoursell Editor

The most obvious problem tac-
lng Buildings and Grounds when
they prepare North Campus
hall for women will be the bath-
room situation. Those urinals
have got to go.

And go they will — this sum-
mer. In an exclusive interview
with the $813, E3111 head Dale
Hawn said that the urinals will
be taken alt the walls, and the
two-inch pipes plugged "All
the girls Will see is a metal
plate covering the wall where
the pipes were," explained
Hawn.

But now comes the crucial
question — will there be enough
toilets? According to Mr. Hawii,
an institutional iacility that does
not have “peak times or usage”
requires one milet ior every
iiitcen women (An oitice build-
ing where coltee breaks or
lunch breaks are taken by all
women at the same time would
need more, but a college dorm,

where women are eating and
sleeping on more irregular
schedules does not have petal-r
times).

it is comiorting to know that
this 15-1 limit is not even up
preached. At the worst, there
will be 7.12 women per toilet.
This number seems more than
reasonable to Mr. l-laWn, and
to Mr. Pomerenk, the Director
of Residences

But — Dean Low wants more
toilets! She wants a toilet for
every tour girls. Well, aside
from being unnecessary, this
added plumbing would be cost-
ly.

For reasons that cannot be
adequately discussed in a iaml»
ly newspaper such as this, a
two-lnch urinal pipe cannot op-
erate a toilet. So, explained Mr.
Hawn, the walls would have to
he ripped open, tour inch pipes
installed, and the walls closed.
This would Come to about $3,500
per toilet.

And you thought the reception
center hurt . . .

ST. JOHN’S UNIVERSITY SLIPS.BM}K

JAMAICA, N. Y. (CPS) —
St. John’s University, which
shook the educational world
when it fired 31 teachers in
1955 in a dispute over the laCul-
ty’s role in policy-making, has
quietly regained its accredita-
tion.

The Middle States Associa-
tion oi College and Secondary
Schools has “vacated" an order
requiring the Catholic univer-
sity to show cause why its
accreditation should not be lift-
ed. The association said St.
John's “is an improved educa-
tional institution” and also cited
the “appointment at a distin-
guished lay educator." Dr.
Henry Mills, as provost as rea-
sons tor liiting the order.

The Very Rev. JDSBph T.
Cahlll, St. John's president,
said, “We are naturally very
gratiiied that the show cause
order has been vacated."

Groups representing college
proiessors were not so pleased,
however. Betram H. Davis,
general secretary of the Amer-
ican Association oi University
Prolessoi-s, said, “It is disap-
pointing to learn that the Mid-
dle States AssoClatlon has taken

this action heiore St. John's
regulations and policies were
iound to be in full conformity
with accepted standards or
academic ireedom and tenure.

lsrael Kugler, president 01
the United Federation of Col-
lege Teachers (UFCT), the
union winch represents 18 oi
the 31 tired teachers Said his
organization was extremely
displeased" at the (120.10“. He
also outlined some of the issues
which he felt should have been
resolved belore the order was
liited. Among “i“:

—The admi stration has re-
iused to allow the UFCT, a local

unit of the American Federation
oi Teachers (AFT), exist as an
organization on the campus.

rThe approximately 100
teachers who struck against St
John’s for Six months after the
31 proiessors were tired should
have been automatically rein-
stated when Lhe case was turned
over to an arbitration group. A
few of the 100 have been rein—
stated but most have taken ap-
pointments at other univer-
sities.

>Tlie arbitration procedure.
which is expected to begin later
this month, is secret, the teacha
ers had to iorego all rights to
sue ior libel and slander, and
they are not allowed to be re-
presented by the union.

oi the 31 who were originally
fired, two have been rellired
by the university, ll have taken

positions elsewhere, 13 have
agreed to arbitration and iive
are still planning to sue the
university. Kiigler said the suit
was intended to bring out into
the open the alleged lack or
academic freedom at St. John's.

The 31 were bred ior union
activity and other shorts to
gain a greater voice in the run-
ning oi the university.

lolt as St, Olaf dethroned two-
