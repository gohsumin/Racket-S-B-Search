Speakers, Speakers . . .

A liai'l'ic—lt editor in Gl'innell’s Information Service 1' -
cently estimated that at least 140 guest speakers will be
ten campus this yeal? For a small college this figure is
staggering,

We believe that this number is excessive, that quantity
doesn't mean quality, that tile overwhelming totill dis-
courages attendance at any of the programs.

Gl'ilincll’s year long “Seminar on Order and Person
:iity," the Program in Practical Political Education, the

Student Symposium, the International Relations Club, and,

several other campus organizations are responsible for
bringing the multitude of speakers here.

Unfortunately, many of the speakers who have come
llere thus or were not l'ewoliting' to listen to, and quite
1.3 'bly milny who are yet to come will be equally poor.

The Svmposium, for example, failed to obtain known

Next year we suggest that campus in lizations as

number of speakers and by an increase in the quality of
the who do come, campus interest would increase sub-
scantially.

Encampment: Promote 'Image

By Ellen Pearce l

Gi-iniiclls reputation
should be an area of concern he 1
cause it detelmines the qualityl
of iaculty that it draws. the
quality of students it attracts,
and the future of its graduates

The following is a summary ,
of the Encampment report by
the Committee on the Grinnell
Image, and all or its ideas and
implications should he considr
ered in the iollowing context.
“We decided that it was nec- ,
essary to put ourselves into
an historical context or chang-
ing niorcs. Thus, in areas re-
lating to the progress in aca-
demic freedom at Grinncll,
where there is deﬁnite criteria
by which to judge, giant
strides can be made without
fear of alienating our ‘Publics.’
However, in marginal or ques- ,
tionable areas, such as social
liberalization, there was some
disagreement over the relative
expedience oi proceeding care
tully, to maintain our reputar
tion versus a continuous striv-
ing to maintain a program
consistent with our liberal and
progressive ideas and philosA
opliy."

The image was deﬁned by:
such synonyms as reﬂection, r-ep-.
rescntation and reputation, andl
the “Public's” tormation ot ourl
image was deﬁned as hearsayi
or. by, and about students, par-‘
ents, friends, alumni; the college
itself; its sports, awards. grants.

publications; and national rat-
ings and surveys.

Grinnell’s status as a private
ly endowed institution also was
thought to give the school a
“great deal more independence"
but at the same time “a more
diversiﬁed public to serve and
satisfy,"

In

l

considering Gl‘innell’s l

reputation in Iowa, the com. '

mittee presented a picture of
a school with an “eastern na—
vor" oi progressivencss set in
a conservative inidwest atmos-
phere resulting in “an extreme

institution that is socially lax.n 1‘

The committee reported the
alumni recliags as ”over-
hear-d lntellectually, w i t h o u t
enough emphasis on char-actor
building " This then concerns ad,
missions standards and empha—
sis on academic achievement on
campus.

Our

“parental public" is a
little worried about murals oli‘
campus, feeling that too much‘
social freedom may exist,”

Thc students retlccted three
areas of concern. The ﬁrst was
the view that the Grrnncll cams.
pus is unreal and isolated. The
problem rests in creating a sense
or community conducive to in-
tellectual pursuits and charactcl‘i

Two weeks ago In this column
we reported the failure of Ihc‘

comes easy. Postmaster Burnett

publication frequency until thc‘
paper is otiiciolly changed back.‘
Thus, in theory we can look
forward to two Carletonians
every week.

The Carletonian‘s editorial ex-
