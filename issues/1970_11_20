and at least six others pre-
sent but not veting. (There
are 128 faculty members el—
igible to vote at meetings.)
The effect of the faculty’s
action on presently enrolled
students is not yet certain; but
moSt likely all students, with
the possible exception of sen~
iors, will be able to choose
which set ofrequirements they
would like to complete. In ad
dition, it is unlikely that any
courses next semester will
be required. (Yes, freshmen,
that probably means that you
won’t have to take second 55,
mester humanities.)

Andy Loewi, SGA president,
opened the meeting withan ef-
fective speech on the “grave

crisis" he perceives at Grin-
nell. He said that many freshr
men were considering leaving
because the education being
offered was not meaningful to
them. He quoted from a book
that tailed curriculum debate
by faculties a “great indoor
sport" with little meaning for
students. He urged the imme
diate adoption of the Wall-
Jones- Clotfelter proposal, but
with tutorials for the first
semester only. It was later
agreed that that issue could
be resolved at a later date.

Trustees Hear Gripes, Suggestions

by Jim Alt

The Grinnell Board of Trus-
tees met on campus last Sat-
urday and Sunday to handle
routine business and to meet
with administrators, faculty,
and student leaders. Two of
their meetings were informal
gatherings open to the student
body at large.

Chairman Lawrence Keeney
convened the first closedmee-
ting in Burling viewing room
at 1:45 Saturday afternoon.
The executive council of the
faculty, executive cabinet of
SGA, President Leggett and
other administrators attended
in addition to about 20 trust-
ees.

After the invocation, a num-
ber of routine votes were ta—
ken. Appointments of Gardner

SGA PRESIDENT Andy

Dutton, George Drake, and
Theodore Lovejoy as trustees
were formalized, as was the
promotion of Velma Hiser
(communications) to full pro-
fessor and granting of tenure
to Louis Zirkle (art). The [r’
ustees also approved granting
an honorary degree to Nor~
man Borlaug, recent Nobel
peace prize recipient.

President Leggett next pre
sented a report on the
college's year to date. He
spoke of the overcrowding in
housing this year and noted
that the formula used to esti‘
mate enrollment had proven
inaccurate. He observed,
“The students were reason-
ably good-natured about it,"
but that “this is really more
than we canhandle consistent
ly without doing something

fundamental about housing."

Leggett outlined the [Owl'r
gown movement and toldabout
Community Day. Speaking of
the first meeting, he commen-
ted, "It did clear the air ...”
He told the trustees that the
public newspaper account of
the meeting was less than fa-
vorable, saying that "It was
written in a rather sneering
tone . . . which was more or
less the point of the whole
article." He said that, on the
whole, community‘reaction to
the [OWl'rgOWn meetings was
good.

Leggett also mentioned the
class agents' return to cam~
pus in September, saying that
"In some ways itwas the most
successful meeting of alumni
I've ever seen on a campus."
He described Guru Steve's
recent visit to campus, and
said thatthe Women's Lib con-
ference lastweekendwas "ra-
ther spectacularlywell organs
ized."

The president touched onaih’
letics, and said that the foot
ball team "ms much more
successful than anyone thought
it would be." He noted that
average attendance was up to
1500.

Leggett spoke on Dean Wall’s
new book on Andrew Carne-
gie, calling its favorable re-
ception "in some senses the
most sensational news of the
fall." He read a review from
the current New Yorker and
commented that Wall may be
considered for certain liter-
ary awards. Wall was absent
from the meeting, watching
his son's last football game
at Cornell.

Leggett then remarked on the
academic reorganization plan
which he has been drafting. He
said that he feels the present
faculty organization is not as
efficient as it might be and
that the executive council is
overworked. He added, "I’ve
been thinking for the pastyear
that some way has to be found
to bring students into the de-
cision~ making process."

He is presently talking with
faculty and SGA executives
and plans to bring general fa-
culty members and students

(continued to page 2)

the tutorial program onanonr
required experimental basis
for one year before deciding
whether to require it for all
freshmen.

He mentioned two major un-
resolved questions about tut~
orials which prevented him
from supporting the program
without a trial period. They
were that he doesn't lmow
precisely what tutorials are,
and he doesn’t lcnow whether
they are feasible. Dean Jos-
eph Wall had said at an earls
ier meeting that 31 or 32 fac-
ulty members had indicated a
willingness to teach tutorials.
Kleinschmidt contended that
that was not a sufficient pool
from which to draw a staff of
about 35 tutors. (Wall later
replied that he anticlpatedthat
many more would volunteer
for the program.)

William C. Oelke, professor
of chemistry; Irwin Goldberg,
professor of sociology; Luth-
er E. Erickson, professor of
chemistry; and Gene G. Wub-
bels, assistant professor of
chemistry, all spoke in favor
of the Kleinschmidt proposal.

Alan R. Jones, professor of
history, arose to speak with
out havlng decided whether to
support the proposal. Event-

ually, he convinced himself to.

oppose it, saying, “All of hi-

igher education is full of une

answered questions; to wait
for answers is to donothing."

Beryl E. Clotfelter also con-
vinced him self during the cou-
rse of thediscussiontooppose
the proposal because he felt
that the proper information on
tutorials could not be gained
unless the program were re
quired. Robert D. Grey, as-
sistant professor of political
science, seconded Clotfelter's
sentiments; and Howard R.
Burkle, professor of philos—
ophy and religious studies.
also spoke against Kleinsch-
midt's proposal.

Robert F. Voertman,profese
sor of economics, Goldberg,
Joseph D. Danforth, profes-
sor of chemistry, and Greg-
ory Guroff, assistant profes-
sor of history, all spokeabout
the meaninglessness of the
debate; Danforth and Guroff
both promised to support ei-
ther the Kleinschmidt or the
Wall proposal if the faculty
would end the debate.

Goldberg summed up many
persons’ feelings when he
said, "It is obvious, regard- .
less of our vote, that the fac
ulty is reluctantly movingfor-
ward to something. They will
be voting to end the debate;
not because of any great com-
mitment to tutorials." Guroff
expressed the hope that the
faculty would get on to some
really important topic--such
as the curriculum as a whole
"upon ending these 11 weeks
of debate.

Black Cultural Weekend Starts
Today: "Time Of Communion”

by Lawrence Wright

Black Cultural Weekend is
dedicated to those lifestyles
that are unique to Black peer
ple. It is dedicated to the en
volvement of Black people in
Black people or, to say itphi‘
losophically, it is dedicated
to our ever greater selfrreae
lization of our situation in the
world today. We as a people
live in a time so mad that one
of the primary decisions on
which this country selectedits
President was that he keep us
in our place. Such dedication
to anti-humanistic policies
will some day doom this pla~
net to its destruction.

We Black people herebypro~
claim this weekend, Novem-
ber 20. 21, 22, to thoseforces
within us that expand our hu-
manistic tendencies and make
us the people we feel we need
to be in this insane world. It
is our primary purpose that
this not only be a time ofcom-
munion, but also a time ofre—
dedication to those principles
which will make our Grinnell
educations relevant to our own
natural environments. So in
essense we are dealing with
our own life styles and the
forces that mold them. And
beyond this we intend to deal
with the nature of structures
which can be erected to deal
with them from our own de-
fined perspective.

Our program will be started
Friday night at 8:00, with a
lecture in the South Lounge of
the Forum by Robert L. Wilv
liams. Williams is the Direcr
tor of the Black Studies Pro~
gram, at Washington Univer
sity. He is a professor ofpsy-
chology at this institution a]-
so. He is noted for his num-
erous contributions to psyche
ologiml literature. He has
dealt extensively with the El-
ack psychological mechanism
and is a proponent of a new
approach to the psychological
problems of Black people. He

will be on mmpus two days and
will participate in an inter-
racial workshop Saturday,
also to be held in the South

Lounge.

The next thing on the agenda
for Black cultural weekend is
an informal discussion, Bl-
ackeWhite workshops. This
situation will be structured
by our next speaker and Prof.
Williams. Leonard Perkins,
who is Dean of Student Ser-
vices at Purdue University,
has a degree in modern lan~
guages, but has practiml ex»
perience in dealingwithinters
racial conflict by his direc-
torship of the Purdue-based
upward bound program for
several years before his ape

$175 Jump

In Tuition

A Grinnell education will
cost each student $175 more
next year, Dean Waldo Walk-
er has announced. The com-
prehen ’ve fee will be $3,700
for tuition, room and board,
compared to last year's
$3,525.

The increase includes $30 for
full board at SAGA, $10 in
room fees, and $135 in tuition
charges. The total will prob-
ably make Grinnell the third
most expensive of the 12 ACM
schools, although the increase
is less than the average $196
expected for ACM schools.
The tuition increase comes
in spite of a stringent auster:
ity program resulting in a
serious reduction of the cola
lege's operating budget for
next year. Expenditures per
student are about $5,200 this
year and are expected to be
$5,000 next year, reflecting
a drop in the overall budget
of at leaSt $200,000. Student ’
contributions to this total will
rise from 67% to 74% under

the new budget.

into the discussions. He said,
"I believe that by the mid—
winter meeting of the Trust
ees I will have something to
present that will represent a
consensus of faculty and stu-
dent feeling." He added that
he hopes to have the plan in
effect by September of 1971.

Because of Wall's absence,
Beryl Clotfelter postponedhis
report on the faculty’s prog-
ress in curricular reform.
Leggett, trying to be tactfulin
speaking of the faculty's re-
luctance to act, said, “This is
a year that the faculty is as-
sorting its right to think other-
wise . . . At this point, there
hasn't really been anaffirma-
tive vote taken on anything.”

Following Leggett's com—
ments, Dean Waldo Walker
spoke about financial and phye
sisal plant plans. He noted that
the college has beguna "slight
austerity program” and that
faculty, students, andadmin~
istrators have reacted “ad~
mirably." He hoped that this
year’s budget would come cl»
ose to the balance point.

Walker then outlined propo-
sed relocation of administra-
tive offices. Due to the libs
rary's expansion ofmaterials,
the Dean of Students’ offices
are to be moved to thepresent
Reception Center on SouthCa—
mpus. The remaining admin»
istrative offices will be in the
White House, presently used
for student housing. Because
of this change and because of
already cramped student hou-
sing, Walker said that he is
considering converting at
least two collegeeowned fac-
ulty houses to student use.

When a trustee asked what
reaction thefaculty mighthave
to this plan, Walker replied,
“The market for faculty me.
mbers is now a buyers' mar-
ket. We now don't have [OPIO’
vide these services to get ia‘
culty. You have to be humani-
uarian, but also a hard-eyed
analyst." He also said that it
is desirable to have adminis-
trative offices as close to
campus as possible, rather
than downtown.

Che trustee asked where a
new administrative building
would ideally be located, if
funds were available. Leggett,
in one of his better replies of
the weekend, said, "Ideally,
an administration building woe
uld be over on Barber Plaza
"on stiltsl"

Vice President for Business
Don Lambie presented a brief
review of the college's cash
resources. A discussion of
funderai'sing plans followed,
during which Leggett reveals
ed that “We've sent copies of
Wall's Carnegie book to the
Carnegie and Richard Mellon
Foundations, after ascertain-
ing that Mellon and Andrew
Carnegie were good friends."

A pointed discussion follow-
ed on increases over planned
building costs for the PE com-
plex and other buildings. The
conclusion reached was that
building costs have, indeed,
risen.

SGA President Andy Loewi,
who arrived late after driving

"THERE WAS no stopping us

back from an alumni meeting
in Chicago Friday, then spoke
at length. His comments in-
cluded:

"I think that we've witnessed
on this campus,andnationally,
a phenomenon that is difficult
to analyze . . . Students have
been turning inward. Few stu-
dents participate in elections
or campus activities (and) fe-
wer are getting into and
emics."

Loewi postulated that such
student reactions are due in
part to the national mood, but
that on Grinnell campus many
changes could be made to re-
involve students. He said that
students coming from progre-
ssive high schools are placed
in Grinnell's highly tradition-
al programs and "are quickly
turned of ."

Speaking of the faculty's work
on curricular revision, Loewi
said, “Last week, a very in-
novative proposal (first sem-
ester freshman tutorials) was
sort of disastrously undermie
ned . . . Frankly, the faculty
has been slow in dealing with
the problem and hasn‘t been
aware of the crisis in the stu»
dent body." later in the mee~
ting, Clotfelter countered this
statement, telling the Board,
“It hasn't been as entirely
one-sided as Andy has made
it sound . . . A lot of faculty
are in favor of tutorials."

‘ Loewi also mentioned pr’og-
ress made towardstudentpar-
ticipation in decision making
in some spheres. He added,
"But in the academic sphere
we really haven't gotten to
first base." He said that he
was “initially quite impress
sed” with Leggett’s academic
reorganization suggestions,
but cautioned that any changes
'0 improvements will not Be
immediate.

Board members then quest»
ioned Loewi, Bill Thomas,
Greg Vranicar, and Mary Br-
ooner. Most of their questions
centered around tutorials, re—
quirements, student evalua-
tion of teachers, group inde-
pendents, and composition of
the faculty.

The afternoon meeting fine
ished with reports by Chris
Nelson and Mary G. Jones on
alumni activities, and by Bill
Deminoff on internal and exe
ternal college communica-
tions and relations.

Saturday evening

Saturday evening at 8the Tre
ustees met informally with
students in Younkers Lounge.
At 8:45 Loewi caught every
one's attention, starting "We
have a list of nonenegotiable
demands . . ." After the Lau<
ghter died down, board mem-

bership and fundrraisingwere
discussed by the group of tr-
ustees and about 50 students.

One student asked just what
the Board's role is. A trustee
replied, "Picking the Presi-
dent is maybe the most im,
portant thing," towhich Legge
ett wryly added: "And getting
rid of himl"

Loewi explained theproposal
that one senior be elected by
his class to serve a [W0*y66r
board term after graduation.
He said that such a member
"could provide part of the in
put on priority decisions”and
that his perspective as a re
c'ent‘student could be benefie
cial to the Board.

The Trustees 'seemedrecep»
tive to having younger meme
hers on the Board, but ObJéC‘
tions were raised about hav-
ing new board members elec-
ted byandperhaps responsible
to a specific constiuency. Tre
ustee Warren Buffett, two-
year member of the Board,
noted that in the short [WO’
year term proposed the board
member couldhardly learn the
financial and legal intricacies
involved.

Many trustees also felt that
someone speakingto the Board
from outside, as Loewi had
done that afternoon, was in a
position of greater strength.
As one trustee said, “Andy,
we sure wouldn’t listen to
another board member talk
for an hour!"

Euffett brought up lack of
financial support from alumni,
saying that only 15% of Grin-
nell graduates contribute at
all, He compared this with Ivy
League schools where the ava
erage is 50 to 60%. Various
reasons for Grinnell's prob
lem were suggested, as were
possible solutions. More such
discussions are likely to fol-
low in the months ahead.

At 9:50 the meeting broke up
into small groups again, where
discussions continued for
some time.

Sunday

Sunday morning at 9:00 the
committee on trustees (a sel-
ection committee) and the ins
vestment committee met in
closed session. Trustees not
on those committees met with
the executive cabinet of SGA
and Deans Klmbo, MacDOV‘k
ell, and Wall to discuss the
revised judicial council pro-
posal which will go to student
referendum shortly.

Greg Vranicar outlined the
proposal, saying that it “tries
to give the judicial councils
more credibility in the eyes
of the students." He notedthat
the all~campus council would
have three students and two

hculty members, eliminating
problems of deadlock votes
under the old 3‘3 system. He
pointed out that open hearings
of the all- campus council are
to be limited to 72 "observ-
ers", which he said “might
eliminate the circusatmosphr
ere sometimes seen.”

Trustee Maxwell Herriot, a
Milwaukee attomey,askedser
vera] wells considered quests
ions andmade suggestions wh-
ich may result in slight chan-
ges in the proposal before it
goes to a student v0te. Other
truStees asked about the small
number of cases heard, espe
cially by the hallcouncils. Lo-
ewi drew a laughwith his esti*
mation of student feeling: "If
you take someone to the judi~
cial council, you’re a fink!"

Discussion then turned to th-
ree areas outside the judicial
council’s jurisdiction: acadee
mic dishonesty, drug cases,
and the “disruption clause"
recently incorporated into the
trustees' by-laws.

After Wall described proce*
dures for cases of academic
cheating and Kimbo discussed
organization and progress of
the recentlykestablished drug
hearing board, the group ex—
amined the new disruption C1,
ause. Under the clause, the
president may take emer-
gency action which is later
subject to review by a board
composed of three faculty
members appointed by the ch-
airman of the faculty.

Loewi and Vranicar quest-
ioned the “vague” definitions
of emergency and the wisdom
of having only faculty membe
ers review actions the presir
dent might take under such
conditions.

Loewi suggested including
students on the review board,
saying, "In an emergencysit-
uation, I could hardly expect
the faculty to be any more im-
partial than students." He nos
ted that faculty members mir
ght also have specific inter-
ests to protect in such a site
uation.

The trustees present agreed
that, if the students can come
up with a more satisfactory
version of the disruption cl-
ause, they will be willing to
consider it.

The meeting broke up at ll
and the board held a closed
general meeting to hear rev
commendations from the two

committees which had been
meeting. A trustee present
reported that Wall, speaking
on curricular revision, pre-
dicted that some form of wt
orial proposal will be passed.

The Board metprivately with
Leggett from 2 to 3, after whe
ich they met informally with
students in the Forum South
Lounge, Loewi suggested that
there be no formal group dis-
cussion, and small groups of
students gathered with each
trustee there. An estimated
50 to 70 trustees,administrae
tors, and students were pre*
sent.

Andy Loewi, commenting on
the weekend with the Trust
ees, said: "I was again 'im-
pressed with the trustees as
people and their willingness to
talk withstudents. A number of
trustees even asked that they
be housed in dorms when they
return this spring.

"The trustees will be an ime
portant source of decisions
in the next few years, espec-
ially on priorities. The Stud’
ents should have no trouble
expressing theirviews to them
in the future

expressed time and again across the Grinnell campus.

Some have compared the stmosphere on campus to the fifties
(you'll be happy to know thata Universityof Hartford couple set
a record for the longest kiss, anda Minnesota fraternity set a
distance record for beer keg rolling), and another student said
that the campus reminds him of an oldtage hOl'HE"af[6r an
active life of protest and involvement, we're sitting back be
cause we‘ve demonstrated that our effort is futile,

The list of what students aren't doing this semester is end
lessr-they're not campaigning, demonstrating, protesting, oc-
cupying buildings, presenting demands in short, nothing poli-
tical. This year's social atmosphere also seems much worse
than last year‘s; people seem more withdrawn, less friendly,
less active, less happy. The obvious answer to all this lack of
activity is that students have resorted to their books as good
students should, but there are few who seriously contend that
such is the case here.

Many national commentators say that Nixonhas preempted the
war as an issue, causingthe drop‘offinstudent political action.
Even if one accepts thatexcuse,why the complete lack of inter
est in local campus issues? There wasa brief flurry of protest
over grades, but that quickly died out; proposals for course
evaluation have lain idle; proposals for group independents
have not gained really vocal support. The faculty has not set
the best example of excitement in dealingwithacademic reform;
the eleven weeks of debate on the requirements issue may have
effectively preempted discussion of other academic issues.

Many have other reasons for blaming the faculty for the
campusrwide apathy. Loewi told the trusteeSthathe feels many
students are turned off by their classes betause they do not
appeal to student interests. He and many others are encourage
ing a revamping of the curriculum to raise student interest and
involvement in their courses--group independents, Studentr
initiated courses might be some of the routes to those goals.
Robert F. Voertman, professor in economics, is interested in
adapting pedagogy to take better advantage of students inter-
ests and class sizes. I hope there will be more discussion of
these issues, both on campus and in the ShE.

The problems with campus social life appear to be very real,
and I’m told that many freshmen have been particularly beset
with problems in this area. Probably one of the major causes
of this problem is thatweare ina transitionary period in social
mores. Many guys appear to be afraid to ask girls out for fear
of being considered male chauvinists, but no alternative dating
style has been worked out. Consequently, many students are
sitting home weekends, since they don't seem to have overcome
the embarrassment of being dateless on a Saturday night.
Answers to this problem are also solicited' -especially' from a
few of the Womens Lib people on campus.

Others would place the blame for the declining social life on
the social Coordinator's office, drugs and the drug culture. or
the hall system. I’d like to spenda few sentences on that last
subject. It seems fairly obvious that the new hall system has
many serious defects. Halls used to be the center of campus
lifewespecially the social life. Now the halls->1 believe Loose
is currently the only exception--are considered primarily
places to sleep and take showers. A first approach might be to
increase the number of coed halls-slast year's room draw
proved fairly conclusively that there is a tremendous demand
for the coed halls. ijortunities should be created for group
room draws and project floors. More emphasis should be
placed on dorm activities-discussion groups, informal meet-
ings with profs, parties, informal activities.

Q16 last paragraph—please bear with me. It continues to
amaze me that there is such a lack of informal intellectual
activity on campusﬁthe good ol' bull session. Also the failure
of Free University to attract more interest surprises me. It
seems like the lounges should be used for some semirplanned,
informal discussion groups almost every evening of the week.

I understand that SGA has sponsored some informal dinners
in an effort to spark some movement to overcome the apathy;
and Ric MacDowell appears to be interested in the problem as
well. The Grinnell Experience you save may be your own.

Orchestra
Will Play

Three Works

The Grinnell College Orth
estra will be presenting its
second concert at 8p.m. Wed-
nesday in Roberts Theater.
David Wooldridge will conduct
the following three works: Ow
erture to a Roman Carnival
by Berlioz, Mozart's Piano
Concerto in Bb K 595 (Rich
ard Howe, soloist), and Tch-
aikowsky‘s Symphony #5 in
E minor.

He chose the music largely
to give the orchestra an op-
portunity to perfect various
areas of their technique: the
Eerlioz for tone quality in the
first part and brilliance in the
second; the Mozart to develop
subtlety and refinement ofde-
tail (he made it clear that
"although Mozart has a repu-
tation of being easy, he is not.
I want the orchestra to see
that his music is worth doing
well"); and the Tchaikowsky
as a change, and “to test the
orchestra's stamina."

Academic Counseling Studied

by Marilyn McKenna

(second in a series concern-
ing developments in various
areas of counseling at Grin-
nell)

What one word character?
zes the academic advising
system at Grinnell directed
by Mr. Raymond Obermiller
and Mr. Charles Sellers? Fle-
xibility. The two men work
together and with all the other
counseling resources to shape
a ﬂexible program capable of
meeting the varied needs of
Grinnell students as individ-
uals. Realizing that academic
problems are often just symp-
toms of more complex diffi-
culties, the academic advis-
ors do not attempt to narrow-
ly define their concern toaca-
demic problems alone, but
with a student’s total exper-
ience at Grinnell. Because the
necessity is seen for continur
ing evaluation and improve-
ment of the program, espec-
ially with the decrease or
complete abolition of acade-
mic requirements, proposals
are now under consideration
which may significantly affect
the quality of academicadvis-
ing in the future.

his fifth year at Grinnell as

Greg Butcher, the Perry
White of Grinnell journalism,
called me in this week to dis-
cuss my contribution to this
issue of the Oldest College
Newspaper West of the Mis-
issippi River, that is to say,
the Scarlet and Black. He
asked me to write a penetrar
ting analysis of the social sitr
uation (if any) at Grinnell,and
of the contribution (if any) of
the Social Coordinator to such
a situation.

I toiled long and tediously,
and even attempted to dosome
basic, hardrcore journalism
by checking on some facts.
I found that there is l) a sort
of underground social life at
Grinnell College, such as Mike
Daley'c oldies parties, 2) an
awful lot of social coordinat-

3) Enoch Smoky is not somuch
talented as it (he) (she) is loud
(How much can we be paying
them to allow them to afford
such a massive amount of
sound equipment?) and 4) it
is pretty difficult to write a
straight column without mis-
representing something or
someone. I do have a modest
example here, both of tedious
labor and probable misreprer
sentation.

The performance of Enoch
Smoky here Saturday night
came as something ofa sur~
prise to a number of Grinnell
College students since they
were under the impression
that the social activities pro—
vided around here consisted
of foetball games, Florence
behind the grill at the Forum,
and faculty and Student Sen-

ate meetings. ’l‘hus evidence
that some of the $47 each one
of us contributes to the social
fund was being used for some-
thing tangible like a ”rock
dance" mme as a shock.
This semester has been den
finitely lacking in the good,
clean, healthy entertainment
we have enjoyed in the past.
Che could argue the relative
merits of the performances
of a Cecil Taylor or the Pin
sant Brothers (where are they
now when we need them?), but
at leaSt they were here for
our consumption. I was struck
by the fact that KDIC is re-
broadcaSting a number ofcon-
certs of very high quality, all
of which took place lastyear -

involved in the effort to im,
prove the faculty-advising
system, which he considers
central to academic advising
as a whole. He feels that the
first weeks of the freshmen
year are crucial in theadjust-
rnent of the student and that
the faculty advisor shouldbe
an initial source of informa»
tion during that period. How-
ever, he encourages to seek
out help from other resour-
ces available such as profs
essors, Other counselors,etc.
in order to get many opinions
to consider when making a
decision.

CHARLES SE LLE RS

A change took place in the
facultyradvising system this
year as new faculty were uti-
lized as faculty advisors for
the first time, reducing the
advisee load for all advisers
from 10-15 each to 678 each.
Hopefully, this will facilitate
a greater amount of help on
an individual basis.

There are severalideas cur-
rently under consideration to
change the faculty~advising
system in the future, but all
hinge on the action taken con-
cerning the Freshmen Tutor-
ial program. Under the Tutr
orial program, the advisor
would not be in the field of
interest indicatedby freshmen
on the pre-registration form
filled out in the summer as
is the case now. Instead, the
advisor would be the instruc-
tor of the required Tutorial
group which would be made up
of 10712 freshmen students.
This would possibly help the
advisor maintains closercon-
tact with the student than un*
der the current system where
an advisor often does not have
the student for class.

It has been proposed that the
faculty advisor be assisted by
an upperclass studentwho woA
uld also be responsible for
aiding the freshmen advisees
who were assignedtothatpalr’
ticular advisor. This would
provide a more specific form
of help in academicareas than
is currently provided by the
SA. program.

Mr. Kintner has proposeda
program in which a student
could meet together with his
professors, advisor, and pos-
sibly the Committee on Aci'
demic Sanding to discuss pro-
blems or plans for the future.
This type of meeting could be
held by request of the stud»
ent, a professor, or the fac-
ulty advisor. This had been
done in isolated insmnces al-
ready but could be useful on a
much wider scale in assisting
a student in evaluatinghisaca-
demic program as a whole.

Academic advising is cer-
tainly not confined to freshman
year, but is a continuing pro-
gram. Efforts are now being
made to provide students with
a wider variety ofinformation
concerning graduate schools
and job opportunities. At re
quest, Mr. Obermiller distri-
butes strong interest tests to
students and canprovide many
other forms of career guid-
ance as well.

Mr. Sellers, at Grinnell
since 1966 and Registrar since
the summer of 1970, specif-
ically handles questions con?
cerning leaves of absence,
dropping courses, and related
questions as well as general
academic advising while also
serving as counselor to for?

For-ronging Discussions Spark Wl Conference
Dixon: US Women’s Lib Scared

MILITANT Women's LiberationiSt Marlene Dixon, on
campus last weekend for the WL Conference, spoke
about the WL movement and the Quebec separatist
movement. (Photo by Marty Sachs)

FeministsStute Their Position

Saturday the WL Conference
continued with the workshops
listed in last week‘s 5&8. Ap-
proximately half the huge
workshop attendance was from
Grinnell. Outside participants
included a surprising number
of married adult women inad-
dition to the expected college
students. While some work-
shops admitted men, most did
not in order to encourage free
exchange. Women were able
to ask questions and exchange
opinions about such subjects
as day (are centers, lesbian»
ism, and communal living.
Discussions were led by soc~
iologist Barbara Chesin,
Shannon, the Iowa City WLF,
and the Feminists.

Judging from participant re-
sponse, the workshop ”Mari
riage and Sexual Intercou-
rse," led by the New York
based Feminists, was prob
ably the most interesting and
controversial. It exposed a
split between old style liberal
and radical WL groups on the
subject of whether or howwm
men should relate to men. The
Feminists began by stating
their position as the first gre
cup in the country to demand
the abolition of marriage.
They saw it as an institution
which benefits men entirely
at Women's expense. While the
Feminists did not rule out
forever all malerfemale rec
lationships, they declared:
"For right now we're more
interested in women relating
to women. For the present,
relationships with men can be
very destructive. They take up
a lot of time and energy, if
nothing else." The Feminist
aim is not "telling women
how to achieve a happy life,
but telling them to struggle
to achieve freedom.”

The Feminists raised them-
teresting question: ”Why sh—

ould it ever be a good thing to
have a relationship between
two people (marriage) that
cannot be broken except by
permission of the state?"
They also demanded that men
and women share equally in
the job of rearing children.
In the second half of the work-
shop, participants fired their
questions and approval or (1115’
agreement at the Feminists.
A Digger dinner of stew and
bread in Gardner Lounge and
informal discussions filled
Saturday evening.

Sunday morning a large grr
oup considered ”WL: A Basis
for Radical Social Change."
A representative from Gle
men explained What she be-
lieved wives and daughters of
military men could do to im-
prove living conditions for en-
listed men and their families.
She said: 'Wlost people aren‘t
afraid to fight if there‘s a
chance of winning. And if you
know how to organize against
the army, you can win in sig
nificant areas. Like officers
can be courtrmarshalled for
mistreating men, so somebo-
dy should see thatthisis done.
Struggles that WL leads are
not just for women but can
benefit all people. A struggle
against the army is a perfect
illustration of this."

NeXt Bonnie Tinker, an Am-
erican student familiar with
the Mexican student move-
ment, discussed Latin Amer-
loan attitudes towardWL. Ti ,
ker said that Latin women dis-.
trust WL because they see it

as ”a frivolous plaything for

the wealthy American gringa.
They don't see how it relates
to their struggles for landand
food. WL has to find a way to
turn on to the very realstrug—
gle in which these people are
engaged." A participant ex-
pressed concern that taking

Last weekend Grinnell Col*
lege was host to a Women’s
Liberation Conference that
drew participants from WL
groups and private individuals
all over the Mid\vest.The Fri-
day night session, "A Defini-
tion of Women's Liberation,"
opened to men and women and
filled Roberts. Marlene Dixon
and Shannon formed a panel
moderated by a Grinnell WLF
members. Shannon, from the
Twin Oaks, Virginia, experir
mental community, began dis
cussion by explaining how that
community tries to overcome
stereo~typed sex roles. Then
Marlene Dixon presented her
provocative views, which set
the tone for the rest of the
evening.

Dixon, a sociologist now at
McGlll University in Monte
real, expressed serious dis-
satisfaction with WL in this
country. She said: "I don’t
think the movement's about
liberation . . . [used to think
the female capacity for emr
pathy was so great that it we
balked to women about their
own oppression, they would . . .
reach across class and race
lines to work for liberation of
all people." However, because
WL ismade up ofmiddlevclass
women, it has too much at
stake in the seams quo towork
for significant social im-
provement." Addressing the
college women in the audience,
Dixon charged, "You don't

WL to Latin America was a
form of “cultural imperial-
ism." Tinker agreed mat cul-
tural differences and North
American afﬂuence make the
situation sensitive: “it's very
hard for a North American to
go to Latin America and not
be an exploiter."

Before breaking into smaller
units for more specific cons
versation, opinions were ex-
changed about the general suc-
cess of the Conference. Most
women agreed that it gave
them “an overwhelming feel-
ing of sisterhood." Differen—
ces in philosophy and tactics
were apparent, and no abso-
lute answers were found. Still,
it was encouraging to note the
large number of uncommitted
women who came to the Con-
ference to listen and learn.
At least the Conference suc-
ceeded in provoking thought on
several important questions
that WL faces.

Dixon Claims

While attending the WL C0“,
ference, Marlene Dixon also
addressed the general college
community about the situation
in Quebec. At a Sunday after
noon gathering in Younker Lo-
unge, she presented the back-
ground for recent terrorist
and separatist activities. Di»
xon stressed the importance
of viewing Quebec as a colony
exploited by both Anglor Can-
adian and American investors.
”There is," she said, ”A kind
of racism in Canada that Am-
ericans are not accustomed
to » the cultural racism his-
torically practiced by the An
glor Canadians against the
French Canadians."

For many years the Catholic
Church was used to control
the people of Quebec. This

want to risk your classprivilr
eges to translate academic
thoughts into useful actions
. . . To ask only forthe repeal
of abortion laws, for birth con-
trol, etc., is not to serve the
poor and the black. They need
more ~ like nationalizedmedi~
cine or the end of the AMA.”

The panel opened for quest-
ions, directedchieflyat Dixon.
She was asked to clarify her
statement that exploitation of
women was inherent to capit-
alism. Greatly condensed, her
reply is that when factories
took away women’s economic
importance in suchhome tasks
as weaving or canning food,
capitalism made middle- class
women into mere ornaments.
Meanwhile, poor women were
economically exploited either
as factory workers or as
housewives in city slums. Di—
xon argued that such oppres-
sion is as much part of capit-
alism as, for example, the
permanent choice between in~

flation andunemployment. lie»
fusing to tag scapegoats, she
said, ”The white male supre-
mists in Washington are im—
pelled by the insanity of the
system. There’s nothing they
can do within it. But is there
anything that says you have to
have capitalism , anything
written on a stone by the hand
of God?”

Asked to name remedies for
what she called “the inhumanr
ity of the U.S. industrial cess-
pool,” Dixon suggested, “You
have to deal with specific is-
sues in the community. Der
mand loml control of hospit-
als and support laboring wen
men. Support young people who
build communes that protest
this anti-human envirour
ment."

A dynamic speaker, Dixon's

, remarks introduced the major

theme of the conference -
WL's responsibility tosociety
and exactly what forms that
responsibility should take.

Men’s lib Reiects Stereotypes

by Bill Knecht

"Men are leading only half
a life," was the tone of last
Saturday’s Men‘s Lib meeting
at 1:00 in Gannaway House.

“Men have the capacity to
act in passive and intimate
ways," went the general ad-
mixture of thought, "although
they are generally taught by
our society to adopt aggres-
sive and egocentric modes of
behavior."

Saturday’s discussion cent-
ered on the differing roles of
men and women in the White
Anglo-Saxon society. It was
generally agreed that both
sexes had capacities for a
broad spectrum of behaviors
and emotions, although our
society tended to push males
to one side and females to
the other.

Males were Viewed as being
naught to assume aggressive,
dominant, egocentric, indeper
ndent roles, and to view the
World as a battleground with
fierce competition for the best
jobs, the most power, and the
best women. At the other ex-
treme, women were viewedas
being proselytized to be sub
missive, unquestioning, emo-
tional, and seductive ~ to
strive to become ripe fruits
waiting to be picked by hand
some princess.

Neither the "ripefruit" cone
cept nor the “handsome pri-
nce" theory seemed accept~
able to the Men’s Lib'ers.

They thought it time to dispel
these notions and to begin
viewing both sexes as 'equai
members of the human race.

Although they lcnew that men
would have to relinquish their
monopoly on power to effect
sexual equality, most of those
present agreed that this wasa
reasonable price to pay for
each sex’s development of the
”other half" of its human po-
tential.

Men's Lib is not a new ph-
enomenon at Grinnell. Two
other attempts have been made
in recent years to found sim-
ilar organizations. Bothfailed
due to lack ofinterestand fail‘
ore of heads to "come toger
ther", due to differing poli-
tical objectives.

As it stands today, Men's
Lib has the potential to be a
going concern. Its members
include some of the mostpro-
minent people on campus.
They do not pretend, however,
to push for campusrwide pube
licity ornotoriety. Character-
isticaliy, meeting times are
spread by word of mouth, po-
tential members being invited
to sit in on a rap session and
relate their personal exper-
iences to the others.

Men’s Lib is neither rhetors
ical nor political. It is per-
sonal. lt pretends no goals
other than those of the self-
fulfillment of individual dis
cussion and enlightenment. As
such, it will never beat mass-
participation endeavor, but it
will be a going concern.

Cultural Racism Exists In Canada

control took the form of ch-
urch schools. Eventually bet-
ter endowed government sch-
ools in the rest of Canada left
French students behind in the
competition for higher educa-
tion and technical jobs. In re
cent years, complaints from
the people caused the Quebec
province government to open
technical schools and make
colleges more accessible to
the French. According to Dix»
on, this liberal pacifloation
proved to be a "dragon."
Students were prepared for
professional openings that did
n0t exist in Quebec, and their
education helped them under"
stand the causes for the pro-
Vince’s economic problems.
A student movement developr
ed. At the same time uneme

ployment, inﬂation, andgrow-
ing welfare rolls drove labor
to militant strikes. Because
the frustrated students were
the children of striking WOI‘k’
ers, the two movements unir
ted as student- labor move-
ments rarely do.
Emphasizing the importance
of American investment in
Quebec, Dixon noted that five
years ago a U.S. Department
of Defense study found Quee
bec to be one of severalareas
in the world where U.S. counr
ter-lns urgency tactics were
needed. Thus, Dixon argued
that U.S. interests saw theme
selves threatened even before
the actual separatist move-
ment started.

THE. SCARLET AND BLACK

WWWSWWW 7W

by Laurle Hultberg

Following three standinge
room-only performances in
Arena Theater, the theater
department’s experimental
production of "Snow White"
took to the road for eight
additional performances in
the Grinnelerewburg eler
mentary schools. The cast
received a warm welcome fr-
cm the students.

The young audiences aetivee
1y participated in each per-
formance, replying to a char-
acter's question by shouting
in unison or by individually
sharing their comments. Such
an insrance occurred when the
wicked witch, portrayed by
Vickie Lofquist, said, “Snow
White, more pretty than I?
What shall I do?" The imme
diate reply from one childwas,
"Commit suicide."

Other children had choice
pieces of advice to give the
cast. A certain boy tried to
convince Snow White (Jamie
Rosenblatt) not to eat the poir
soned apple. But in spite of
his better judgment,SnowWh-
ite bit into the apple and died.
When Doc, a dwarf played by
Karen Auerbach, announced
the death of Snow White, the
boy said, "I told you so."

The high level of enthusiasm
possessed by the cast helped
bring the imaginary setting to
life, and create an active at-
mosphere between the cast
and audience. The wicked q“,
een played her part so well
that one child tried to annir
hilate her during recess by
throwing a rock at her. Nor
did anyone want to play with
the wicked queen’s mirror,
Deborah Sanden. who was left
to play all alone on the sw;
ings.

The mood of the play, how-
ever, was not only created by
the characters. The dancers,
Elizabeth Copeland, Marilyn
Musser and Maria Perotto,
intervene within the action to
tie the plot together. The mue
sicians, Jim Spell and Greg
Gaines, with their original
score, guitar, and electric
organ also added to the spirit
of the play. Jim Spell’s intro—
ductory songs, die theme song,
and tunes denoting individual
characters excited the young
audience.

The children’s emotionalrer
sponse to the play could be
seen after each performance
as they rushed to dance with
the handsome prince, charaCe
terized by Richard Smith: the
King, played by Ronald Ai; or
Snow White. Other children
showed their enthusiasm by
running for pencils and papa

ers so they could get theautoa
graphs of each of the dwarfs
-- Doc, Sleepy Sneezy, Happy,

Bashful, Dopey and Grumpy,
played by Karen Auerbach,
Jane Friedson, Phyllis Gan-
ser, Jule Kagan, Deni Deut-
sch, Jack Gay and Greg
Gaines, respectively -- and
other members of the cast.
Other reactions to the play
were reﬂected in drawings by
the children. Such works of
art included Snow White, the
Handsome Prince and his
sword, the wicked Queen and
her mirror, the seven dwarfs,
and Jim Spell's guitar. In
short, the response was very
enthusiastic.

Public and college response
has been so good that the cast
of Snow White, under the dira
ection of Don Boros, will per-
form once more in Arena The
eater at 8 RM. Monday.

eign students.)He emphasiz-
es the importance of main—
taining a program flexible err
ough to meet the changing
needs of the Grinnell student
body. The declaration of an
independent major by seven
students at Grinnell is an ex-
ample of the changing needs.
This option has been stated in
the Grinnell catalogue for at
least fifteen years, but no one
had taken the opportunityuntil
this year. It will more im-
portant than ever, in this type
of program that the academic
advisor act as a real coordin-
ator between the various de-
partments involved in the stu*
dent’s major.

Mr. Obermiller pointed out

will never be a simple cure-

"A Vision And A Prayer

The Hallie Flanagan Davis
Theatre, fondly known as the
Arena Theatre, opened its
doors Thursday night to a
previously unproduced pair of
one acts. The two one-act
plays, united under the one
title of "A Vision andAPray‘
er", were adapted by junior
David Hechier from two of
Anton Chekhov's short stor-
ies: ”()1 the Way" and “A
_ Story Without an End”.
The first exclusively student
produced program ofthesem'
- ester, it is directed by senior
‘Larry Grimm as a theatre
independent. Grimm has cho-
sen to work with an unprodu-
ced student's adaptations be-
cause he wishes to capture
the impact of Chekhov‘s short
stories on the stage and to
offer the audience an alterna-
tive perspective of Chekhov.
, Hechler feels he was able to
gain invaluable experience in
writing as well as benefiting
from an association with the
art of drama. Both Grimmand
Hechler are experiencing
their first productions here

The infamous "Bill 63,"whc
ich provided for the use of
English in Quebec schools,
triggered the separatist drive
when Parliament passed it
over heavy French protest.
Seeing that Anglor Canada of-
fered only “assimilation and
exploitation," as Dixon said,
the French formed a separa-
tist-socialist party that re
ceived 26% of the province
vote in its first election. Al—
armed, several liberals joins
ed the party and tried to kill
the separation issue. DisgusV
ted students then left to form
the Front du Liberation de
Quebec.

The Front devised a manir
festo which Dixon said ”talks
the people's language. It deals

with specifics, not rhetoric.
And the university people and
workers agree with the grief
Vances and demands of the
manifesto . that’s the beauti-
ful thing - even though they
don‘t always buy the violent
tactics of the FLQ.”

About the Front’s murder of
IAPorte, Dixon said, "The
FLQ made a horrible mis-
take. It really believed the
Anglo-Canadian government
would exchange prisoners, but
the government decided la-
Porte was not important enr
ough. It preferred making the
FLQ look like monsters."Al~
so, LaPorte's murderpermitr
ted the government to invoke
the War Measures Act, sus—
pending the Constitution and
Bill of Rights. Dixon contend-

ed that the Act’ is being used
speciﬁcally to kill the separ—
atist movement.

"You see," Dixon explained,
"if Quebec goes separate, in—
dustry may benationalizedand
Amerlmn and Anglo-Canad-
ians will be driven out. Even
if Quebec doesn't nationalize,
it will certainly vote in social
democracy. The increasedta-
xes to pay forpublicmedicine,
etc. will be hard on private
corporations." Quebec's de~
parture would set a bad ex-
ample for other dissatisfied
provinces in the federation.
Returning to the American
government's interest in Que-
bec, Dixon declared, ”An in‘
dependent socialist Quebec:
would directly threaten Ame
erioan control of the contin-
ent . . . like a Chiba across
the Vermont border."

The Quebecseparatistmove-
ment is threatened from two
quarters and mnnot survive
without the support of some
Americans. And for Dixon the
most sobering discovery to
come out of the Canadian cri—
sis was: "If neo-ﬁascist tac-
tics . like the War Measures
Act - can be used in Canada,
they can be used anywhere._"

Tie Closes Soccer Season

The soccer types completed
their first season under Coach
Keith Fisher and undernewlyr
established varsity status by
tying Drake University at l- l.
The final game of the 1970
campaign featured many ofthe
aspects that made this a frus'
trating season for Keith and
the team‘rfailure to capital-
ize on breaks and an inability
to score while generally con-
trolling midfield and playing
aggressive defense. This last
game was enjoyable however,
as the team played well des—
pite blowing snow and (BU-def
gree temperatures and a poor
set of directions which got
most of the team to the game
45 minutes late.

The game was barely a min-
ute old when a Drake attacker
«(in a gold stocking mp) broke
through the asyet—unorgan-
ized Grinnell defense to put
one in. it looked like another
long afternoon for the Scarlet
and Black, but Dave Coron
scored the first goal of his
Grinnell career within a cour
pie of minutes of Drake’s,
tying the score for the rest of
the afternoon as it turned out.
The Grinnell defense quickly
got it together and shut out the
Drake attack effectively.

Howard Reid played goal for
the Pioneers, and turned in an
outstanding performance des-
pite adverse conditions and
limited experience. He deserr

ves much» of the credit for the
Grinnell showing in this yme,
as he made many fine saves
against experienced Drake
attackers.

The soccer team closed at
37472, which was not as good
a showing as was hoped for
when the team assembled in
September. The loss of Steve
Hirshorn hurt, as did a gen-
eral letdown which appeared
midway through the season.

In any case, the team lost or
tied its last five games after
a fast start. Keith can look
forward to next season and
the return of his scoringstars
Tom Lincoln and Steve Kore

of Hirshorn. Saturday's game
was the last for seniors Bruce

Dix, Howard Reid, Craig Gorr

Knox Shaves Grinnell

Grinneil’s Pioneers contin-
ued their losing skein at Knox
in the final game of the sea-
son. Both teams,going into the
game, had identical league
records of 4-3 and were tied
for fourth place, but Knox
walked away the better, 28’25.

Grinnell drew firstblood ona
19 yard field goal by Twinkle
toes Roy Lewis, but from then
on, the game was dominated
by Knox, as they struck for
TDs in each of the four quart
ters. Mike Eslick broke for
77 yards and a touchdown in
the first quarter, and Kelly
Cahoon scored from 13 yards
out in the second quarter to
leave Knox on top 14—3 at the
half.

in the third quarter, Bob
Boiler scored on a one yard
drive, and early in the final
frame, John Hubner plunged
over, also from the one. Thus
Knox led 28-3 in the fourth
quarter before Grinnell could
get started.

The Pioneers never fully
gve up, however, despite the
met that theballgame hadbeen
rendered meaningless by their
previous two losses. Grinnell
finally got an offense going
following Hubner’s score, as
they drove 56 yards with Wa-

Pope: Students Must Save "As

To: Students of Grinnell
From: Dick Pipe, IM Director
Re: Article by the C. Kid

First let me say this is not
the article that I had written
after reading the article on
lM’s. My initial impression
was that of dire wrath, but
that has since been dispelled
through conversation with the
anonymous writer. [had read
the article gettingthe impres-
sion that it was a personalat-
tack upon the directors of the
[M program, as I think others
also assumed.

But upon the conversation of
tonight I realized that thearti~
cle was not intended to be so,
but was rather intended to help
us and to get other Students to
help us in the restructuring
program of lM’s, a task wh-
ich has met much difficulty
and won’t get off the ground
unless the students sodemand
it. The 1M program this year
has been far from satisfac—
tory, in fact it has been one
of the bleakest on record,
save for some Sterling per‘
formances in the past couple
of years. This has been the
result of the restructuring of
the old hall system, and the
shift in interests of the stu-
dent body from the archaic
"win for the old hall” spirit.

I’m not saying this isn’t good,
but too many people feel they
must win no matter how they
do it, and this detracts from
the enjoyment that should be
derived. it has also led to
many people not wanting to
participate, as they have no
desire to be stomped on by

Jollie Rollie and the rest of
the gang of Clark, but would
rather go out and have fun
and enjoy themselves. Butthis
again is not the basis of the
problem confronting IM’s.

The crisis can be solved by
adequate and upsto-date lear
dership. Craig and myself
seem to be willing to give it,
but the powers that be balk
from the chore. It is no secs
ret that the system needs ov~
erhauling. We need a system
base on interest groups as
was suggested in the article,
not one based on the hall sys*
tem. There is not enough ins
terest within most halls to
conduct a worthwhile 1M pro
gram:

'ihis idea is not new. Idis~
cussed it this summer with
the powers, but the idea was
cast aside. Perhaps this was
my fault for not emphasizing
its emphasis, perhaps the bi-
ame should lie with thepowers
for wanting to stick with a
crumbling empire. That mat-
tors not. What matters is that
something needs to get done.
it needs to be done rather
soon before the program disr
appears entirely. Our hands
are tied. We must deal with
our superiors, and thatseems
to be out of date.

People complain of no offis
cials for volleyball. With the
monetary situation of the coir
lege, we can’t afford to pay
people to officiate. A member
of North suggested that we
might give PE majors for of-
ficiating so that there will be
an incentive involved. One

power said it isn’t a “carry-

over” sport so we can’t do it.
I'm not saying it deserves a
major; i do think it involves
enough for a minor, but they
will only give, and this has
not been approved, one team
sport towards the team sport
requirement. This was not
enough incentive for anyone

to volunteer.
If you have a complaint or

suggestion, come to Craig or
myself with it. We know what
is happening with theprogram
and can accommodate the sug-
gestion. Otherwise your sug-
gestion or complaint becomes
part of a verbal attack upon
us as to why we're not doing
our job. They aren’t proces-
sed to assess the value of
them. They are used as wea-
pons. Come to us. We can
help and are willing to. We
want to see theprog—ram work.
We want to change it so itwiil
work. But with our hands tied,
we become part of the upper
echelon who directs and
doesn't listen. Think about the
program, not about who is
writing this and why he might
seem bitter.

Perhaps the C. Kid is right.
By remaining anonymouspeo-
ple will think about what he
says, and won't try to ration-
alize it by lmowing who wrote
it. The program is for the
students, and it needs help. it
is up to the students to save it.

shington ”Baby Bull" Alston
, going over from the two. The
pass for the two point conver—
sion failed. Followinga fumr
ble recovery, the Baby Bull
scored from Knox’s 16, then
ran for two points. A poor
punt set up Grinnell’s final
score as the Pioneers took
over on Knox’s 44. Gorgeous
Gary Johnson hit Henry ”the

Flash” Corona with a 16 yard
scoring Strike, and " ack"
Robinson ran for the twopoint
conversion to run the count
to 28—25, Knox. However, th-
ere were just 16 seconds left
in the game, and Knox killed
the clock.

The game was, thus, a case
of too little, too late. Grinnell
proved in the fourth quarter
they could score, yet they did
so too late to mean anything.
The Pioneers just didn't get
aroused over this meaningless
game until the fourth quarter.

An important factor is that
Grinnell had to play without
two starters, Jim Pirolli and
Randy Sarver. Both suffered
ankle injuries againstSt. Olaf.
All in all, however, the season
wasn't a total loss, as the
team stayed at .500 and per
formed as the experts predics
ted they would.

IM Revolution

(yawn) and North is in third,
(Tra-la). But what is this?
West Norris Hall seems to be
trying to create a revolution
in the ranks of the 1M stand—
ings. It has the audacity to tie
North for third position in the
V-Ball league! Excuse me for
getting so carried away, but I
was almost under the impresa
sion that their were only three
winning teams in the league.
Right On West. Smith Hall is
also a winning team witha ll- 7
record, that ties them withthe

The upset ofthe weekwas last
Monday night, when the men of
Haines overtook the Cla rkHall
‘A' volleyball team 21 in
games. The sorry part of the
story is that Haines did n0t
have enough hall members for
a ‘B’ team and lost the series
4‘2 games.

The only concern I received
as to my last week's article
on the 1M system came from
an [M head. So in response he
has addressed himself to the
claims and suggestions that l
have made. Any response to
his article would be welcomed
by myself and the sports staff.
