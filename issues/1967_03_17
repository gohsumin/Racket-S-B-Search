Senate: last meeting under Kent

Senate approves AWS

Constitution changes

By Richard Schneirov

Wednesday night the Senate gave its
approval to changes in the Aws Con<
stltution and heard the final reports
or the Executive Cabinet and the
chairman of the Finance Committee,
The meeting marked the end or the
elected terms of all senators and the
members or the executive cabinets

in the only major legislation of the
evening the Senate approved the tol-
iowing three changes in the AWS Con~
stitution: (l) Withdrawal of the AWS
from the Intercollegiate Association of
Women’s Students; (2) elimination ot
the social budget committee and clar-
itication of the role of Quad Social
Chairman; (3) incorporation of the
offices of Decorations Chairman, Music
Chairman, and Kitchenette Chairman in-
to a new hall social council.

Speaker at the Senate, Bond Faul-
well, in his iinal report, both praised
the Senate and criticized it. He lauded
the work oi the committees in general,
but criticized senators for their “lack
0i initiative.”

Faulwell also gave his Views on the
role ot the Senate:

“1 do not think that the Senate as
un official body has any responsibility
or right to act on such national and
international issues as the Vietnam
draft. I think it is up to each student
as an individual to express his own
opinion rather than [or the Senate to
attempt to express a collective opinion
tor him, in the iirst place, there are
more than enough problems on this
campus to keep the Senate occupiedr
Secondly, senators are elected on the
basis of campus and not national or

mittee Chuck Wall delivered the com-
mittee‘s year end report consisting of
evaluations and recommendations. The
Finance Committee includes Senators
Phil Bertenthal, Roger Koenker, Jane

Wall reported that “we started the
year with $776.14 and made expendi-
tures and received income such that the
balance as the new administration takes
office will be $858.29. The major ex-
penditure irom GB&R (General Budget
and Reserve) aside from the cost of the
convention and the campaign which
came to 5323, is the $270 for damages
incurred on North Campus.”

New dorm focus for
question of residence

By Susan Fogg

Building proposals tor a new women's
dormitory are becoming the focal point
tor student leaders’ growing desire to
reevaluate the concept of Grinnell as a
residential College. The View as ex-
pressed by Lynda Thoman (AWS board
member elect) is not an objection to the
new dormitory, but rather the protest,
why a women’s dorm?

Karen Lauterbach (AWS Board Presi-
dent) leels that betore the proposal {or
the dorm is finalized, alternative forms
or housing should be considered, espe-
cially in light oi the recent innovation or
apartments tor women. This might in-
clude buying old houses in town tor off»
campus dwellings, as Melinda Ward
suggested. or building cooperative liv-
ing units for students. This latter plan
presents difficulties of finance and could
create unwelcome pressure on students
who do not enjoy community dwelling

By numerical maiorify —

There is really only one sense in which a new court system
could be considered a “community court.” To date, no one on cam-
pus has dared to deal with it in this - its most honest and most
desirable sense. According to the definition of community, the stu-
dent community is the viable community at Grinnell. Fortunately
students and faculty live much or their lives in common. But it is
the students who actually live together, sharing basic living experi-
ences with each other. Some might prefer it otherwise but this
is the reality on our campus. it is not that we should separate aca-
demic and social but that we do not share to the same degree with
all members or the community.

Then why are students — those most familiar and most con-
cerned with this real community — not permitted to order the
community themselves? Apparently there is a great teat among
their elders in the administration that things would fall apart if
students had their way. Former Presidents Gates and Bowen both
placed much iaith in students’ ability to govern their own lives. As
tar back as 1887. the Gtinnell College president (Gates) was say-
ing, "It is ten thousand times better that the young people should
learn to govern themselves, than that they should be governed in
any best way whatsoever."

The iaculty discussed the proposals about a new court system
at their meeting last Monday but they railed to even approach can
sensus. The laculty obviously have their own doubts about the pro
posals, especially about being caught as middlemen between the
administration and students. Certainly the abolition of the Faculty
Committee on Student Atlairs is a step in the right direction but
these new proposals should not be the ﬁnal word ~ and they might
be if students support them in the upcoming referendum.

in trying to improve upon our present oourt structure we run
the danger of reverting to a system whereby students will actually
have less control of their welfare than previously. Perhaps it will
be more constructive it students, faculty and administration hear
court cases and make policy together, but the iaculty and adminis~
tration need not be represented in equal ratio to students. Let us not
target who has — in areas of student concern ——numerical majority.

The new look—

Well, we finally got our name change _ at least on a “trial"
basis. We apologize tor the long delay. If you remember, a couple
of weeks ago we announced that we were planning to change the
name. But, then, choosing a new name, getting it passed for trial
publication by the Committee on Student Publications and putting
it into actual design all require timeconsuming deliberation.

Early in this deliberation we had viewed other college news-
papers to note the tone set by their names. We came across me
Bmwn Daily Herald, The Commentator and the Antioch Record -
all straightiorward in approach. But other colleges use —— what our
type-designer calls — the banner. Some examples or college news-
paper names styled like banners are the Brown and White, and, an
ever so trenchant one, The Crimson Arrow. We thought some more
about our own Scarlet and Black and, well . . r we asked for sug»
gestions tor a new name.

We were looking for a name that would be short and sell-de-
lcriptive. We considered names that had Similar connotations like
”journal,” “weekly” or “news,” but “reporter” won over the others
on several counts. “Reporter,” besides being less common than the
others, has broad connotations. For instance, although we take the
view that the Grinnell College newspaper should be, at best, a
journal, future editors may take different tacts. “Reporter" could
describe them all. The Grinnell Reporter represents a break from
the cumbersome ilags oi yesterday. We think, all in all, the new
ﬂags set a more mature and intellectual tone for the paper.

The paper’s “new look" is furthered by several other changes.
A switch from the narrow ﬁve column width to four columns on
the front and other key pages will foster easier reading. The col~
umns are wider and so are the white spaces in between. (We did
not change the column width on every page because or some set
advertisement widths.) Also note that the sports page has been
jumped to the inside of the paper.

We welcome your comments about our changes and hope that
you will consider them improvements as we do.

Grinnell student writes —-

Student Life in Belgium

Ed. Nolc:
.loii Klove, a political science major, is a
member of Grinnell'i class at last. he writes
of his year abroad at a college in Bruges,
Belgium, and of his daily lite there “with
the hope that I will have served undergrad»
uates in planning their oil-campus study."

i chose to come to Bruges and the College
d'Europo to get the opportunity to learn more
about Belgium, this Small and loﬂoiten neglect-
ed country. I have round it a nation of deep
cleavages: those of religion, class and language.

The iringe political parties are calling tor the
dissolution of Belgium and the annexation of their
respective areas to Holland and France. it is
worthy to note, also, how the linguistic pendu»
lum swings back and forth, first threatening the
Flemish and now the Walloons.

At present, the pendulum is pointing south —
with the coal regions of Liege coming into eclipse
and the growth or industry making a booming
city of Antwerpen. Further evidence of the fear
felt by the Walloons can be seen lrom an article
appearing in their weekly magazine: “Le Ciel~
estece Flemande?“

But, aside from the knowledge that i have
gained about this country in which i am studying,
which alone has made my program a success. 1
have also beneiited from my courses and item
the international atmosphere or the college heck.
I have been exposed to dliierent polnw or View,
hr example. in seminars conducted by Europeans
on Viet Nam, or those about the reunification of
Germany and the problems of south Tyrolia.

The College d’Europe, tountled in Bruges in 1952,
was designed to train post-graduates for positions
in the diplomatic corps of their respective coun-
tries or for posts in various international organ-
izations. Over 51% of the graduates of the col.
lege have taken jobs with the Common Market at
some time following their studies at Bmges. This
is due primarily to the proximity of Brussels
and a strong alumni organization, l’Anclen, which
operates from that city.

Bruges itself is in the Flemish-administered
portion oi Belgium. but the college recognizes
Only French and English in its classes. All can-
didates for admission must speak and read both
languages and be able to write one of them well
enough idr papers and reports.

Students are recruited on a competitive basis
by examination, which is held in their home
Countries, with criteria established in that coun-
try. Many of the students are here on scholar-
ships, which are also directed irarn the ioreign
ministry of their country. Because of the unique
European orientation of the College, there are
only two noneEuwpeans in the student body: a
Congolese and myself. The rest come from Scan-
danavia, all countries of Western Europe, Greece.
Poland and East Germany.

The ages of the students vary. but the average
is 25, The range runs trom a Greek lawyer, 32,
it) myself, 22. Some of the students are already
employed elsewhere: tor example, a Norwegian
journalist is here to do some stories on Norwegian
embassy life in the Benelux countries and on
Belgian agriculture and a Polish protessor is
hereto get a closer view of the “decadent West."

Daily Life
On Monday nitemoon, at Mb 30 (2:30), the

weekend officially ends. Students have returne

from a weekend in Paris at the Picasso exhibition
or from a promenade along the Belgian seacoast,
only 15 kilometers irnrn Bruges. Walking along
the beach in mid-winter is a Belgian custom
which many of the students have adopted. The
beaches are as packed in winter as in summer:
the only diiierence being you don‘t go in the wa-
ter and you bundle up against the harsh Channel
Winds.

It is on Monday afternoon that I meet a sem-
inar conducted by an American prolessor from
the University of Massachusetts. The custom has
been to have a visiting American on the iaculty
oi the college each year. I am taking two courses
under him: “Defense Problems of the West" and
a course on NATO: its structure, purpose and
political problems. However, on this particular
Monday, class lasted four hours and became a
joint seminar with a lecture given by a NATO
official in Paris and an American General at
SHAPE in Fontainbleu.

Following the talks, a reception was held {or
the visitors at the Maison des Etudiants, our dor-
mitory, which is a few kilometers from the
“Dyver” (our name for the classroom section oi
the college corresponding to ARH). it is a
pleasant walk over small bridges, under which
a maze oi canals z' zag through the city. once
at the Maison, aperttifs consumed, guests hav-
ing departed, the bell for dinner is rung.

Quite unlike Grinnell and its cafeteria-style,
the students at Bruges are spoiled by being
served dining room style — with not so much to
do as fetch one’s own glass of Wine. The Maison
was once me Grand Hotel at Bruges turned over
by the city for use by the students as a dormitory.
Everyone has his own room and both boys and
girls live together. Indeed, a discussion of “open
dorms” would be quite alien here,

Alter dinner, which is ﬁnished at about 8:30
pm, the students begin retiring to their rooms
for study or to the lounge for catching up on the
latest news irom the newspapeis of their home
countries. Lite between 8:30 p.111. and ll:0li pm.
is very quiet, at which time the sound of type<
writers is perhaps the most penetrating of
noises. But, by 11:30 pm, one begins to heat the
sounds oi the Beach Boys, or the Trogs on “Radio
London” (a pirate radio station operating 21/z
miles oil the British coast, which comes in loud
and clear in Belgium).

The college is returning to liie again, as one
hears students descending the spiral staircases
tor the "Roi d‘espagne,” a small bistro nearby
which serves as our Version of the Forum. it is
run by an old Belgian and her dog, the latter or
which makes an inspection at everyone who en-
ters — and sometimes proves to be quite selec-
tive about those who may come in to enjoy his
mistress hospitality. The old lady herself has a
soil-touch and has been known to extend indeﬁnite
credit to the students. Free rounds are also not
entirely rare.

For those who have not. left the college, there
are always rooms where dancing takes place. in
others, one can hear bridge-bidding in German
(oi all the nationalities the Germans remain the
most addicted to the game) or the groans of the
Danish. as they lose their last Belgian trancs in
a heated game of poker.

 

To the Editor:

tellers . . .

To the Editor:

i feel called upon to point
out some cloudy thinking which
has in the past characterized
various sections of the college
community. The administration
is ahnost universally suscept-
lble to it, the faculty tails vic~
tirn on occasions, and even the
student body becomes contused
from time to time — now is
such a time.

There is, I think, a basic dit-
fercnce between liberalism
and irresponsibility. The two
terms are tar from synon-
ymous. A lack of irresponsibili»
ty does not even imply a lack of
liberalism. And yet we tend
so oiten to overlook this fact.

I’m referring here speciﬁcally
to Mr. Shender'a lrticln about,
the Com? election (March 10
seal. I'm especially surprised
that a student of Mr. Shender's
intelligence and experience
should tell into such an obvious
error.

The sooner all of the mem—
bers of the college community
learn to make this distinction,
the sooner we will be able to
make some progress on some of
the reforms which the commu-
nity so sorely needs.

Perhaps I should make one
final point clear; 1 am neither
attacking Lemaire nor tlelend-
ing Mr. Fllgeltaub, l merely
want to try to clear up this
confusion and Mr. Shender's
article offered an opportunity
to do just that.

Blcinshard promotes 'usefulness of thought’

By Paul Jones

Dr. Brand Blanshard, Sterling Pm-
ilessor Emeritus and twice chairman of
the philosophy department at Yale Uni-
versity, just wasn't cut out to be a
practical man. This, he said during his
visit here this week, was his basic
reason [or taking up philosophy as a
lite-work.

But this does not mean that Blan<
shard ieels philosophy is impractical.
,When asked about the role oi the philos-

opher in contemporary society. he said,
“There is too much emphasis on feeling
and impulse in American society, too
much emphasis on doing things on the

spur of the moment; there is too little
emphasis on quiet reilectinn, on giving
evidence of direction by reflective
thought." He remarked that even tho
pragmatists, “though i don‘t like them
too much, Still, believe in the usefulnesl
oi thought." The role or the philosopher.
then, is “to deemphasize indulgence ln
emotion, and to answer the questions
raised by the plain man in modern
society."

Blanshard went on to say that the
philosopher is a iundamental part or
the intellectual community. But “I would
prefer to see competent professors at
philosophy in every department. Unless
the course is one dealing only with
iacts and methods, a knowledge or phi-
losophy is needed to answer the questions
brought up in every classroom. The
ultimate college, it it ever is started.
should be one of all philosophers."

when questioned about the relevance
and s u c c e s s of modern philosophy
(especially linguistic analysis and com<
monusage analysis), Dr. Elanshard
said, "On the whole, this type ni phi<
losophy is running up a blind alley,
i think it’s merely a passing iad in
philosophy. 1 don't think this method
can answer the questions or the com.
mon man that need to be answered."

Dr. Blanshard concluded by saying
that he was extremely impressed by the
intellectual community at Grinnell;
“Out of 117 colleges that I have visited
in the last couple ot years, I thillk
that Grinnell stands out in iront of most
ofthem.”

Dr. Elanshard’s visit marks the third
in the series oi visiting philosophers at
Grinnell. Professor John Compton oi
Vanderbilt who was here two weeks ago
remarked then that it there is anyone
left in America who can be classed
on the plane at the systematic philos-
ophers at the beginning of the century,
such as James, Russell, Moors, and
Santayana, that man would be Brand
Blansllard.

Double Jeopardy 0an

By Suzanne Gelber

At the present time it is the policy at
the College to impose institutional pen-
alties on students who have violated lo.
cal civil law, even when the Violator!
have already been subject to municipal
discipline and when the civil offense 1!
not a violation of college rules.

The practice oi imposing such institu-
tional retrial for civil offenses was
severely censured by the Committee on
Faculty Responsibility tor the Aca-
demic Freedom at Students of tits
American Association oi University Pro-
fessors, (AAUP) in its statement of De-
cember, 1965, on the Academic Freedom
of Students

in light ut the justihcetions the Col-
lege protters in deienso at “double jeo
pardy" a La. the college’s responsibili-
ty to the town of Grinneli and the right
or the college to temporarily suspend
or dismiss any student Whose conduct
or academic standing is regarded as
"undesirable” — it is obvious that the
AAUP statement has been largely lg-
nored.

On three separate counts elaborated
by the AAUP committee. the college
may stand justly accused oi anachronis-
tic autocracy, with respect to the “dou-
blo jeopardy" policy. First, the section
0! the AAUP statement which discusses
the oft-campus freedom of students
makes speciﬁc reierence to the conflict
between institutional authority and civil
penalties:

Students who violate the law may
incur penalties prescribed by civil
authorities, but institutional authority
should never be used merely to dupli-
cats the iunctiun or general laws.

Catch - 22

as an academic community are dis-
tinct from those of the general com-
munity should the special authority at
the institution be used."

To be more specific. recurring college
imposition of a fine on a student who
has already been fined in the municipal
court for using false identification to ob4
tain liquor is not only a clear example oi
duplication or function. but an instance
where the academic community cannot
logically exercise special authority
based on a distinction of interests. In
such an instance, the College falls prey
to the authoritarianism which is an irr
herent danger in any powerful institus
tion.

in fact, invoking “double jeopardy” in
cases which involve no violation of cul-
lege rules places the institution in a po-
sition unduly subordinate to community
pressure. As the AAUP statement etu-
phasizes with regard to the exercise oi
inslltulional authority, “Institutional ao-
tlon should be independent at community
pressure." The college, then, has the ro<
sponsibllity to function as an autonom-
ous institution wimin the community. II
this not the ”idea of the university?”
It seems that Grinnell has confused the
notion 0t its “Social responsibility” to all
extent which belies what should be Lila
“separate but equal" status or the edu-
cational institution in nil its affairs.

A third Objection to the “double jeo-
pardy” policy rests on the total inado.
quacy and autocracy oi Grinnell’s own
calchsall, “Catch-22”, to quote both “13
handbook and the catalog-

“The college reserves the right to

require the temporary suspension or

the permanent dismissal oi any stu-
denl whose conduct or academic
standing it regards as undesirable,

Without assigning a deiinite reason.

the college and its olficers Shall be

under no liability whatsoever for

the expulsion of unsatisfactory stu-

dents."
N0 statement in the handbook Dr cata-
log contains evon indirect reierence to
the extent or the college’s authority in
disciplining Civil violations. What, Orin
may justly ask, is “undesirable con-
duct;" who is an “unsatisiactory stu-
dent?" Does a petty cwil violation autor
matically assign a student to the “un-
desirable” category? Where has the col-
legc established its right to exact Ii<
nancial penalties for civil violations?

One can do no better than to quot.
once more from the AAUP statement:

Offenses should be as clearly de-

tined as possible, and such vague

phrases as “undesirable conduct" or

“conduct injurious to the best in-

terests of the institution" Should be

avoided. Conceptions oi misconduct
particular to the institution need
clear and explicit definition.

While we are in the process oi estab
lishing a community court. it is essen-
tial to object to such inequities in the
jurisdictional system as the “double
jeopardy' policy and the solemn
hypocrisy of “Catch-22 " It is not:
enough, however, merely to register dis-
satisfaction. Student protest is all too
oiten “sound and tiny, srgntiying noth-
lng,"

We must insist upon a clear and ex-
plicrt definition not only of the rules
which govern this community, but the
philosophical precepts upon which they
are based. in the event that such explica-
tion is sidestepped by those who are
ostensibly in authority, as in the ques-
tion of the justiﬁcation ot academic
penalties for social violation. we must
develop, practice and adjust our own
dellnitions of conduct.

of faculty, administration and
students began to work more
carefully with plans, we realized
the idea to be both unfeasible
and unworkable in the current
situation. We therefore aban-
doned the concept in reference
to the Judicial Council. We ex-
cluded administrative represent-
ation on the council for the
same reason we excluded stu-
dent government officials: we
were trying to Create a body
which could work as impartial
ly and objectively as possible
with student disciplinary prob-
lems; a group without an insti-
tution or constituency to be
responsible to, or to “repre-
sent.”

2) A second major concern
of ours in constructing the pro-
posal 7 besides trying to create
an atmosphere of objectivitye
was the tragmented, “enclave”
nature ot our campus: men stu-
dents, women students, facility,
administration. We suggested
the establishment of a com-
mittce of faculty. students and
administration to recommend

and evaluate policies for the
campus (perhaps primarily con»
cerned with student lite). This
we feel to be the proper place
for the discussion of campus
and student concerns, joining
the main elements of the resi~
dential campus — the faculty,
students, and administration7
in these discussions, This would
be the place for those concern-
ed with voicing particular in-
terests to attempt to formulate
common decisions regarding
those interests.

3) Faculty members were
suggested for both the judicial
council and the policy evaluat-
ing committee tor several rea~
sons, not merely or solely to
act as a “buffer" between the
sometimes conflictive views of
students and the administra-
tion. The school has made
significant progress this year
in working out some of the dif
ferences in opinion held by the
various element ot the campus.
However, ive still have can»
siderabie way to go in coming
to common understandings
about student life in the gene
eral and specific case. The
faculty is an element of this
campus and should be a part at
fig; creauonruf this understand-

regarting student lif .
While the facility member:
should not be seen as neces—
sarily “representing” the facili-
ty (any more than the student
Judicial Council members
should be expected to “repre-
sent" student views). their in
dwidual opinions and concerns
should be included in the at-
tempt to arrive at a generally
acceptable way of living.

I believe the proposal to be
a reasonable way of addressing
ourselves to the various prob»
lems of student life. and of ar-
riving at some general agree-
ments regarding life at Grin»
nell.

The Grinnoll REPORTER

Crosseff questioned
To the Editor:

it seems to me upon reading
Mr. John Crossett's article in
last week’s 5&1: entitled “Cum-
inunity Court" that he did not
present the tacts. but rather
had several misconceptions
about the council, its nature,
and its purpose which should
be careiully considered.

First is his application of the
term “community court.” The
originators or the ideas of the
proposed court system revita-
lizhlion have not used that term
since the proposul’s intancy,
simply because of the reason
mentioned in Mr. Crossett’s
article — the phvsical impas~
sibiiity of such a group. They
have used the term “judicial
council” since the time of that
realization # a name that is
unquestionably suitable to its
purpose and nature.

This brings me to the secs
ond misunderstanding in the
article which is bound up in
the purpose for creating a nciv
system of jurisdiction and polls
cy evaluation. l question Mr.
Crassett‘s statement, “ I would
argue that there has been no
lack of communication but
rather a lack of intellcgent in-
terpretation." Communication,
or the lack of it. is a problem
basic to all of our interactions.
The judicial council is a means
of combining the present stu~
dcnt courts with the present
FCSA. The aiudicative and
policy evaluation iunctions
would then be separated into
the judicial council and the
policy evaluation council. in
such a combination. both the
court and the evaluating coun-
cil would (in theory) bring to.
gether the opinions ot the fa-
culty and those of the students
and the administration into two
bodies, constructed to eliminate
an overlap of functions and at
the same time represent the
opinions of what today amounts
to the three “factions" on cam-
pus. In these united councils,
all the members can much more
easily communicate and inter-
act with one another than in
the present system, and can
make decisions based on their
joint opinion.

in taking the niartyi"s posi-
tion as a faculty member, in.
Crossctt was confused. again in
the factual basis for his inror
lndtiun. The proposal was pre»
sented to the Scnatc by the
student members of the present
court system; but it was con.
structed by not only those stu-
dents bnt also by Dr. Joseph
Wall and the student deans
nir. Crossett was concerned
tiiat the facultv would he
placed in a middle man between
the administration and the stu
dents. However. all the meme
bers of the council would be
equally involved with any rc-
commendations made to the

To the Editor:

Having read Mr. Jones’ let-
ter, I feel bound not. to defend
myself, but to correct some
(also impressions.

In the iii-st place, I was in-
vited hy the Scarlet & Black
to review the opening night oi
the show and not to “have re
maitied one or two more nights
heiore making (his) Judg-
merits.“ Whether a show he
collegiate or protessional, the
practice ct revrewing on the
first night is not deemed un-
tisiial. Indeed, when I was un»
der the impression that certain
things were under par because
it was the opening night, I
noted them as such in lily art-
icle.

I am not sure what Mr.
Jones means when he says he
was “given the review to
read“ and it thereupon spoiled
his enjoyment of the play.
Surely it was up to Mr. Jones
and no one else whether or

not he chose to read the re-

view.

As for being preoccupied
with "dramatically and techni-
cally protessional theatre,” may
I remind Mn Joncs, that as a
student at the University hf
Iowa, I encounter college pm-
duotions all thc time. The
point is that in choosing to
perform so sophisticated and
ditticult a play as “After the
Fall,” the company assumes a
certain responsibility. what I
as a reviewer am interested in
is not so much “professional”
theatre, hut GOOD theatr .. I
never saw the Elia Kazan
production of the play. I
matched the production
against nothing but itscli and
what seemed to me to be its
olln aims and foul lines, and i
found not that the performance
was especially lacking (it you
\lill re-read the article), but
that the play itselt tell short.

Finally. let me assure Mr.
Jones, that it he came away
moved and involved with the
play, i am more than pleased.
When so much etiort and time
has gone into a show (any
show), I would much rather
see it work than fail, and will
be happily proved wrong.
George Bernard shaw, when ac.
cused of ruining a play's
chances in a review, argued
that it a work is really good.

- dition to her other suggestions, she
said of olt campus living for women:

"Now with at least a tentative and tem-
porary possibility tor women’s apart-
ments, 1 can only hope the college will
hesitate long enough in its plans for
a new women’s dorm to seriously con-
sider alternative forms or residence.
My personal feeling as a member of
the dorm plaruiirig committee is that
by accepting at this time as unalterable
truths the college policy towards resi-
dence living and the separation of the
campuses, we are moving too quickly
to a plan which only solidifies the
present system and eliminates other
possibilities."

CofHP President Bob Fonts reminded
the Senate of the considerable progress
that students have made in the past
four years He added that he hoped
to see the elimination of the car rs-
striction rule, drinking regulations, and
women's hours in the near future,

SGA President Steve Kent spoke of
this year's new “student image", but
oautioned students to remember that
the “problems are complex."

Finally, the Senate approved the al-
location of $270 from GB&R (General
Budget and Reserve) to cover the hall
damages incurred this year,

Steve Kent also announced the no
pointrnent of John Denny as Social

Civilian government in Vietnam?
the generals still Ila/ll the cards

By Howard Motfett
The Collegiate Press Service

El). NOTE: Howard Moffett, 1565‘
66 editor of the Yale Daily News.
has, for several months, been a full-
time correspondent in South Vietnam
for the Collegiate Press Service is the
second of a series of reports to air
pear in the Reporier.

SAIGON, South Vietnam (CPS) --
American oiiicials, the press, and Vict-
namese politicians are setting the stage
hero for a dramatic transfer of power
from military junta to elected civilian

Government, South Viet Nam's new-

constitution will be ready by the end
of March. in April local elections will
be held in an estimated 39 per cent
of the country’s hamlets. By September
the nation may have a duly elected
president.

The Constituent Assembly in down-
town Saigon buzzes with energetic
speeches. Hopeful politicians say the
new Constitution could be the first step
toward true democracy — if the mil-
itary will guarantee honest elections.
-American officials talk of a “new pt»
lltical atmosphere,” and point to the
temporary blocs in the Assembly as
the seeds of future political parties.
The American press is already focus-
fng on possible candidates for the
presidency.

Military runs Vietnam

But make no mistake, the military
still runs South Vietnam. Beneath the
surface of Civilian politicking there are
clear signs that the generals intend to
play a dominant role icr some time
to come.

No one is better qualified to speak
for South Vietnam’s military establish
ment than Lt. Gen. Nguyen Van Thieu.
At 42 the French-trained Thieu is Chief
of State, Commander in Chief of the
Armed Forces, and Chairman of the
Ionian National Leadership Committee
(or junta) by whose grace Air Vice
Marshal Ky governs. Thieu is a small
man, \vith a bright young face devoid
of Wrinkles. Yet his Voice is heavy
and authoritative, and he puffs oc<
casionally on an impressive English
pipe with a leather-covered bowl. His
finest hour in combat came when, as
a colonel, he commanded the troops
that assaulted Diem’s palace in the
1963 Revolution.

General Thieu spent almost an hour
this afternoon.talking off the cuff in
his wellrappoinled office at General
Staff Headquarters. what emerged was
a pretty clear picture of how the gem
erals size up the Current excitement
about civilian rule. In brief, they aren’t
nearly as excited about it as the
civilians.

Underlying everything he said was
one idea: South Vietnam is in a
crisis situation, of which the War is
only one part; or all the major prob-
lems facing the country, there is not
one that civilians are equipped to handle
as well as the military. Listen to his
reasoning as it came out in the course
at the interview. You may not like
everything he said, but you‘ll have a
much better idea of what is likely to
happen in south Vietnam in the
near future, and what isn’t.

He began by saying that the Con-
ltitution should be promulgated and an
elected government established as soon
as possible. He thought the first would
take a month and a half, and hoped

for the second within four to five
months after that.

Questions and answers follow. with
commentary in parentheses.

Q. General Thieu, are you satisfied
with the present draft of the Consti-
tution, or do you feel the legislative
alid judicial branches have been given
too much power? will South Vietnam
need a stronger executive?

A. Well you know, some members of
the Constituent Assembly Want to run
too fast toward democracy. 1 think in
general the Constitution is taking shape
well, but some parts of the draft are
not realistic toward the real situation
of the country. But we are continually
talking With the Assembly members,
and I think there will be time to ex-
plain to them and have these parts
changed.

(Score one for the military: super-
vising the drafting of a civil Consti-
tution, Talks between the junta and the
Assembly have in fact been going on
for some time. They began when it
looked like the two groups might clash
over controversial Article'ZO of Decree
Law 11, which gives the generals the
prerogative of amending the Assembly's
Constitution unless overridden by a two-
thirds vote.

Junta pressing Assembly?

General Thieu's comment underscores
another question which has puzzled oi»
servers here for some time: is the
junta bringing pressure on the Assembly
members to get objectionalbe sections
changed, or is the compromising mu-
tually amicable? The importance of the
question lies in the fact that the As-
senibly’s slowly rising public stature
derives largely from its independent,
almost defiant posture toward the mil-
itary government. if it comes out that
collusion or pressure is involved, the
new Constitution may be politically
dead before the ink is dry.)

Q. What parts of the draft are you
referring to, specifically?

A. Primarily the election of province
chiefs. This is democratic and ideal<
istic, but it is not practical for the
present time of war, or for many years
after the war. The province chiefs will
have to be appointed by the executive
and coordinated through the central
government. We are a small country,
you know, and we cannot afford in-
dependent states with elected governors
like you have. . . .For some time more
we will need to maintain army officers
as province chiefs. This is a difficult
job, and it requires a man of action,
a military man. A

(Score two {or the military: province
administration.)

Progress of war

i asked a series of questions about
the progress of the war. General Thieu
replied, “it is Very clear that for a
year the Viet Cong have had no mo-
mentum. They have no more hope of
winning large battles such as in 1964
and 1965. They won’t seize any prov-
inces. They are still infiltrating, of
course, but we can handle this problem."

(Score three for the generals: defeatr
ing the virulent wily Cong.)

Q. General Thieu, there has been
much talk of peace in recent weeks.
Do you see any chance for a nego—
tiated settlement at the present tithe?
Are there any circumstances under
which the government or South Vietnam
might enter into peace’ talks with Hanoi
or the NLF?

A. We have to be frank and just. We

have been at war for 20 years. The
reason we are fighting, and the reason
America is fighting with us, is that
we do not want a Communist invasmn.
But we want peace, we want South
Vietnam to be quiet. We would accept
a just and honorable peace, if Hanoi
would stop its invasion. But there are
no signs yet that Hanoi wants peace.
They are still convinced they can win
—not so much militarily now. but po-
litically. So i see no move toward
peace yet. Remember too, they may
be under pressure from China to con
tinue the war, even if l-ianol might
want peace.

Possib es of peace?

Q. But General Thieu, there seem
to be signs now that Ho Chi Minh
might settle for less than a victory. it
is well known that Russian supplies ior
North Vietnam have been stopped at
the Chinese border, and the recent
chaos in China may mean that China
will no longer be able to pressure
Hanoi into continuing the war. A news
paper report yesterday cited North
Vietnamese sources in Hong Kong as
saying that Ho Chi Minh no longer
feels he can win the war and is look~
ing for a possible negotiated peace, in
which the National Liberation Front
might have the minor share of a co-
alition government. Would terms like
these be acceptable to South Vietnam?

A. Up to now we do not recognize
the possibility of the NLF as a po-
liticai entity in a Coalition government.
When Hanoi is feeling weak, then it
will withdraw its forces, and then I
believe the NLF will collapse. They are
not strong enough to Continue fighting
by themselves.

Military role in future?

Q. Suppose a future civilian govern-
ment were to seek peace negotiations?
Would the military feel compelled to
prevent it?

A. We do not feel a coalition govern-
ment would be acceptable to the Vlet<
namese people, All people in South
Vietnam -- students, politicians, all of
them _ are afraid of a coalition govern-
ment because our political structure is
not yet strong enough to counter the
political forces or the Viet Cong organ-
ization. We are not well enough organ.
ized.

(It is true that South Vietnam’s non-
Commuuist political structure is frail
— fragmented, disorganized, faction-
ridden and propped up by a host of
vested interests. It is also true that many
Vietnamese nationalists would sincerely
like to strengthen it beiore a peace
is signed, in order to prevent a Viet
Cong political tour de iorcc.

it is patently untrue, on the other
hand, that no South Vietnamese would
accept a negotiated peace and a co-
alition government, Even among those
who have no sympathy for the Viet
Cong. there is growing feeling that the
war must be stopped. Some students,
religious leaders and politician-intel-
lecturals have said privately in recent
weeks that they are willing to take
their chances with peace and politics,
knowing full well that the Viet Cong
have the single strongest political ma-
chine in the country.

But the army is intransigent, and tho
generals still hold the cards. If the
v.5. ever decides it wants to negotiate
in Vietnam, it will have to persuade
the junta as well as Ho Chi Minh and
the NLF. So score four for the military“
arbitratmg a “just and honorable"
peace.)

Friday. March I1, Ivor

Q. General Thieu, how long do you
think it will take to organize political
parties that may stand up to the Viet
Cong?

A. That will be a very long pro
cess — perhaps ten years. You must
remember that we have never had an
opportunity to organize democratic par-
ties in Vietnam (He cited conditions
under the French, Diem, etc.) But we
cannot have a true democracy without
strong political parties. One of the jobs
of the future government should be to
help parties to organize and strengthen
themselves. The only parties we have
now are very old and fragmented.

Problems of new government

Q. Do you mean to imply that the
army might serve as a possible base
for one of the strong political parties
you envision?

A. i am against political parties in
the army. (in the other hand, if any
retired military men wanted to organ-
ize a party using other retired army
men, that might be good. Army dis-
cipline would give them a strong
organization.

(Score five for the military: provid-
ing a skeleton on which to hang a
fleshrandrblood political party. Though
the idea may be repugnant to Ameri-
cans, the alternatives for non-Commw
nist Vietnamese are just not that hope
ful at the present juncture. Both Ameri-
can oliicials and Vietnamese general!
are paying close attention to Korea’:
experiment with soldiersrturned-politi-
ticians. What an army party might do
is force the fragmented groups of cl-
vilian nationalists into forming one
large party of their own. Nothing else
has brought them together.)

Q. What problems will loom largest
for the new government when it take:
over next fall, General Thieu?

A. Their problems will be the same
as ours: defense and security, pacifi-
cation, refugees, the Open Arm pro-
gram Many of these will require
military management. Soldiers are more
qualified to handle them than civilians
would be, Civilians would have no
cadres, no trained leaders, no resources
for rural reconstruction. In a crisis
situation, the nation must depend on
the military. For example, when the
situation turned bad under Diem, he
had to call on the army. It is the
same now.

"War has been interesting"

Q. General Thieu, how have the gen-
erals of the Directory reacted to carry-
ing the responsibilities of the nation
for almost two years? Are they tired,
would they like to return to strictly
military duties, or do they enjoy serv-
ing in this capacity?

A. (with a laugh) Well, we are not
tired -« I have been fighting all my
life. It's been very interesting ~ the
direction of the country in wartime -
and we’re Very encouraged with the
results.

(No comment. Score as many as you
like for the military.)

General Thieu is right. The army can
do many things that civilians in Viet-
nam are neither equipped nor prepared
to do. The one thing that the generals
can not do is win the enthusiastic sup
port of the people. That being the case,
the View from here is that this frus‘
trating war, supported by no one ex<
cept those who are fighting is likely
to continue in its present vein until
either the Viet Cong or the ARVN run
out of foreign support.
