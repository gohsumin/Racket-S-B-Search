standing is illustrated by folk
sayings, for example, “Happy
is he whose sin is pardoned.”
Rabbi Rosenthal went on to
illustrate the relationship be-
tween rcligioii and psychiatry.
“Bath See that love heals,” he
said, “And that hate hurts.”

The need to love others as ex-
pressed in the words, “Thou
shalt love thy neighbor as thy-
Self” is now a form of psychiat—
ric medicine. ”Love is a tonic,
while hate is a poison," Dr.
Rosenthal said, “a poison that
harms the hater more than the
hated,"

Dr. Rosenthal’s second speech
in the chapel at 11:00 Wednese
day morning was devoted 1.0 the
subject, “The New Religious
Dialogue and our Political
Scene." The talk centered around
a recent visit to Germany which
he made with several other
American clergymen at the re
quest of the Bonn government.

Dr. Rosenthnl spoke of the
deep feelings of guilt and
frustration which people ex-
perience today as n result of
the atrocities committed by
the Nazis before and during
the Second World War,

t h c
made their final ammendments
and accepted the proposed con—
stitution.

The final meeting convened

a few minutes after l am. at
which time the chair felt that
a quorum had struggled into the
lauditorium. On every hand, dele—
gates were glancing over their
mates or checking amendments
which they planned to propose.
On one hand could be counted
the number of interested sper—
tators who had come to watch
lthe working out of problems on
lthe document which they were
soon to vote for or against.
1 Chairman Gary Thurston ex-
»,tended an informal message from
the deans, reminding the delee
gates that once in every three
'or four years a high pitch of
excitement and accomplishment
has been built up in the form
of‘ a constitutional convention,
only to trail off into ineffective—
ness as the delegates wear down
‘from the constant pressure.

Thurston then asked that
delegates give their entire at~
tention to the problem before
them, and the five and one
half hour siege was underway
with the calling of the roll.

The name of the proposed
governing body was changed in
the preamble to read the Grime
nell College, Student Govern.
,ment association, and then the
lredundant first article was
lstrichen from the record.

Changes in wording were made

ment in the membership section
of the legislative article, the
meetings and procedure section,
parts one and six, with the dele—
tion of part seven. Part four of
the officers and duties section
was also deleted.

Other substantial changes un-
der the legislative article set
part one of the election section
to read, ”the speaker of the sen—
ate shall be elected by the sen-
ate, at the first meeting followV
ing installation of the ncwly
elected men’s representatives
from those submitting petitions
‘to the S.G.A. president at that
time. He shall be a iunior who
has maintained a gradopointav—
eragc of at least 2.0.” Under in.
stallation, part one, the speaker
of the senate wa: included.

In the cxccutive article, now,
the cabinet was set to meet
weekly. Section 13., subordinate
bodies, was included, to read,
“the subor nate executive bod—

  
    

'ies Shall be the AWS board, and

Coil-IF which shall be Comprised

 

  

ctive residence halls and
house councils which oper-

 

the '

Constitutional convention‘

in an effort to polish the docue'

Under the section on offices,
the qualifications of the social
coordinator were struck, and
composition was changed to
read, “1. Composition

”Permanent members of this
board shall be the members of
:the executive cabinet, the stu—
.dent deans and activity director.
:There shall also be three stu—
dents and three faculty meme
bers at large. The chairmen of
the student social committees
may also be invited to advise
the planning board.

2, Selection of
large

The students at large shall
be selected by the senate at
the first meeting in the fall
from those submitting applica—
tions to the senate, The facul—
ty members at large shall be
selected by whatever means
the faculty desires."

Part six was changed to read,
under duties, “an AWS Board
member shall be the head ad-
ministrative officer in her resiv
dence hall." Part seven w a s
written to include other enforce.
ment power. “Other enfor e-
ment power may be vested in
those persons so designated by
the CofHP and AWS board on
their respective campuses.”

Under the Judiciary article,
now in, membership, part two
was changed to read, “the dean
of men and the dean of women
shall be invited to meet with
the men’s and women's primary
courts respectively in an adviSA
cry Capacity.“ Part three was
added, “two faculty representa-
trves shalt be invited to meet
with the high court in an ad.
visory capacity.”

Under powers and duties, parts
‘twc and three were combined,
as were parts four and five.

Article VI, dealing with ani—
mcndrncnt and ratification now
reads in section B, amendments
to this constitution may be pro—
posed in the following manners:
by petition of at least 10 per
cent of the student body; by a

To the Editor:

Mr. Morris’ letter of last week‘
concerning the “Grinnsll Re.
view” deserves, I think, an an
swer by someone who is more
aware of the problems which
confront such a student publiv
cation and of the recent history
of the “Review" than Mr. Mor-l
ris appears to be. since its in-‘
ception in the spring of 1959,‘
the “Review" has made no pro
tense of being an exclusively}
literary journal. it ‘has printed
two articles dealing with his
torical topics, one with biology,i
and a group of pseudo»philoso-
phical analyses Each of these‘
seemed to be met with a good
deal of interest by our sub—,
scribers
l The reason for such diversity
is obvious The job of editing,
such a magazine is primarily al
selective, not a productive one.
In other words, a lack of good
fiction is a lack on the part of
the Grinnell students rather
than the editorial staff.

On a campus which has only
one class concerned with writ—
ing creative prose, where stuvl
dent poets (and we have some
remarkably good ones) have to
work entirely on their own with-

shown in some of these articles
we feel is compensated for by a
unique breath of point of view
and their pertainacity to the
Grinnell student.

Another reason that the "Grid
nell Review” feels free to use
material from a variety of fields
is because unlike “NOUS” it is
neither sponsored nor subsidized
by any department or studenti
fund to whose purposes it would
bc obliged to limit itself. It is
financially dependent, therefore.
on advertisements and studentt
subscriptions to cover its operat
ing expenses, and we have di
covered that both these sources
tend to vary rather too unpr
dictably for comfort. 1 persons
ally doubt that a student pub-
lication of the nature of the
”Review" can exist for long and
Serve a meaningful role on cam-
pus without some more depend~
able means of financial support.

These are the reasons for the
abbreviated length (you needn’t
count the pages, they‘re numr
bored) and the only partially
literary contents of the latat
issue of the “Grinnell Review”.

A committee appointed by the council to consider mem-|

bership reported a few weeks ago that it would delay
any final recommendations until “The Beloit Report" a
detailed analysis of Beloit’s investigation of the organi-
zation, and its recommendations had been considered

The Beloit analysis proved a favorable one for the
Association, but there are still objections to be reckoned
with. One of these comes from the budgetary point of view.
NSA membership will cost at least $200 dollars; right
now the council has 49 cents, Some have suggested that this
money might come from a decision to resign from the
national Association of Women Students wllich presently
spends $162.00 annually. This money is used by the AWS
Board in order to Send officers to the regional and na»
tional conventions. This ”out" however has its drawbacks

from his usual mental condition,
but this week he is especially at
‘odds with the world. Perhaps his
feeling of unrest is due to the
four flimsy little papers he re-
ceived in his mailbox Monday
afternoon, or perhaps he has seen

it also contains several points

is Something more than the awe-

 

influence felt,

The “pro" side of the NSA questions is filled with
the fine record shown by the organization during the loy~
alty oath problem The NSA is a recognized lobby group

which has made itself felt in Washington on several oc-
casions and often on matters in wllich Grinnell students
have shown some interest or sympathy. Among its other
activities are included a continuing liberal stand on the
sit-in movements, support of the Peace corps and a lobby
concerned with the dubious practices of the House and
Senate Investigating committees.

In addition to its national voice, NSA at Grinnell,
locally, might provide some of the “continuum" needed to
preserve the interest in national affairs encouraged by
Duane Krohnke and company, Such “continuum" may come
in handy next year when the student council leadership
leaves their hands. The pressure provided by an outside
group dedicated to reflecting and encouraging “the broad-
er loo ” among students, may well be the very thing
which will keep the work of this last year’s Student Colin—
cil from falling by the wayside, as just another wave in
the Grinnell interest cycle.

As has been shown, membership will involve some
problems; leaving national AWS may not be the answer
to the bugetary question; the Women’s Association should
certainly not be dropped without a thorough investigation
and report Aside from the money, however there seem to
be few insurmountable obstacles, and arguments for NSA
membership look too good to be overlooked

Two Year Cui-
ls Considered
For AFROTC

The Air Force has proposed
the idea of telescoping the has

course into a two year program.
This program would be called

program.

A two year
ship” of about $1,le per school
year for each selected candidate
for commission is; part or the
Air Force proposal. This money
would be paid to the individual
at the beginning of each school
year.

The new program has been ap-
proved by the air start and is
now awaiting review by the
Department of Defense for leg.
islation. It would eliminate the
two year basic course which Air
Force officials regard as a bar-
rier to attracting needed cata—
gories of college students.

Under the proposed plan,

college students would enter
AFROTC training in their jun-
ior year. Subjects now taught

in the basic course would be
taken in two summer camps.

The first camp would come
between the sophomore and
junior years, the second, he'-
tween the junior and senior
years. Participants would be
lpaid for their time in camp.

Two reasons for dropping the
basic course requirements are
the high cost of producing a
ROTC graduate and the increas—
ed study load heaped on science

and engineering students. A two.

year program would enable

transfer and junior college stue‘

> dents to participate in ROTC.

According to Capt. Morris C.

quire'ments for participation in
the proposed program would be
similar to those for “the

Foreign Policy
Opinion Split

Bob Pois was moderator of a
discussion concerned with the
military aspects of American
foreign policy in a disarmament

Loose lounge Tuesday.

According to group spokes-
man, Mikc Montross, the 18
members in attendance were di—
vided in their opinions as to
the importance of continuing to
display national military
strength,

Some members felt that aid
to neutral countries should be
given precedence to displays of
military might, while

tary force in the furtherance
of American peace goals.

stopped again. i saw, to my hor-
ror, that I had taken thewrong
bus, and hadn’t any idea where
I was. My Greek failed at this
point, giving way to various ex—
clamations of surprise, shock and
strong disapproval. His English
also gave way, so he iust stared.

At that point, a warm voice
said, “I speak a little English.
May 1 help?" Turning. i saw a
large woman, tightly holding-
her unmbrella against the storm.
I left the bus to explain my
story to her, and as i was
speaking to her, it left. She sawl
by disappointment, and told me
not to worry. I was quite near
the college, although it would be
impossible to go in the rain, as
l was aheady soaked. "So," she
smiled broadly, “you‘ll conic
home with me: You’ll stay with
my family tonight and tumor—
ro\v~well, we’ll see.” ,

My feeble protests were]
ignored as she marched me to
the flat that was home, shout.
ing ahead to the family to stop
quarreling—she was bringing a
”kathigit'is” (teacher) with her.
Soaked, exhausted and bewild-_
cred, I entered the small home
to find myself enjoying tradi—
tional Greek hospitality, begin-
ning with a preserved fruit, a
small cup of strong Greek Cafr‘
fee and the standard questions,‘
“Where me you irom?”—“Howi
old are you?"—and “Are you
married?” A rather hectic in—,
troduction to Mrs. Diktiopoulos
and her family.

Near Anatolia college is any
other American school which
was described in the Reader’s
Digest (Sept. 1960) in an article
entitled, “They‘re Helping
Greeks to Help Themselves” (I,
think that was the title, any}
way) and one of the students
there is Kostas (short forKon-
stantinos) Koprantzellas. I met
him while visiting English class

 

girl from a neighboring school,
from the same town, and was to
meet this girl and go there.

indignantly refused to believe
that my loyal friend Kostas
would lie to me, so called him
two days later, He was not at the
Farm school. Didn’t I know? He
left for Sarrai two days earlier.

1 spent a delightful Christmas
vacation plotting the best way
to get revenge for this insult.
When the students came back, 1
was rudely awakened by one of
the college boys beating on my
door at 7:30 am. to tell me 1
had a phone call. It was still dark
(I for-got 1 had pulled the cur»
tains the night before), so l told
the student to take the message.
He returned to tell me a stu-
dent from he Farm school had
called, named Kostas, “What?”
1 roared. “At this hour? What
did he want?” ”Sir, he says he
sends you his greetings.” An exs
tremely rare phenomenon fol—
lowed this: J was speechless.

I saw Kostas about three
days later, and then by chance,
since I had gone to visit John
Minatsios. Smiling broadly as
usual,, Kostas came in and
tried to think of something
to say. Finding nothing, he
just smiled, although a little
less strongly.

Finally the suspense was more
than 1 could stand, and I asked
how his Christmas was. He an.
swered so quickly that I pur-
sued the topic in mind, and ask.
ed about his girl friend. With a
look combining hurt and shock,
he asked what girl i meant. No,
he had gone home alone. 1 rec
minded him he left at 2:00,

meeting her at the station, and‘

got to Serrai at 5:00. But. . .g 1?
He couldn’t remember any girl
I could mean. Of course, he had
been with his cousin,

age to write an objective columni
when the ghost of Jerry Gray
rose up before me, clothed in a
laded Cowles sweatshirt. saying,
"The whole world is fruit." This
bit of wisdom led me to realize
the error of my thinking. The
torch of chauvinism has thus
'been passed on once again. I
only hope 1 may be able to do
considerably more acclaiming
than excusing.

After two weeks of play, the
basketball picture is still a bit
muddled. Cowles, the defending
champion, is currently ilndefieat»

The night before the students,
left, I was attending a Christmas
program at the Farm school and
told Kostas when i would come,
He, instead of being happy about
going home, sadly told me that
he wouldn‘t be going to Serrai,
but had to spend the entire Vaca-i
tion at the Farm school making‘
up days he was absent.

Apart from my own disap.
pointment x was very sorry for
Realms and angry at the laws
which make a student miss his
family at Christmas, and, in an
effort to make him happier, I
asked him to come to the col-
lege for lunch one day.

The next day as lwas walking,
back to the college with another-l
friend, John Mintsios, l expound
ed at some length on the in»
justice being dealt, and was sure
prised at a confused look on hisi
lace, and then, laughter. it

one with the problem of lacking ;

me this, and when I told him;
that it was Kostas himself, he
tried, unsucessfully, to change
the subject. l

Finally the truth came out;
Kostas was leaving at 0 that
very afternoon for Serrai andl
hod no intention of making up;
his days. It seems that he had aI

many who still consider the
acts of a government as sep

religion.

But, Rabbi Rosenthal conclude

l
lCouncil
,Cont. from p. l

by the social coordinating co
mittee.

Shipley’s motion was impor—
tant. too, because in approving
it, the Council overrode a ino-
tion that it had passed sev-
eral weeks ago to send all
concert requests back to the
halls for their approval. How-
ever, because Shipley empha—
sized the lack of time avail-
able to contact Miss meson,
and because of the superb
reputation which Miss Russell
enjoys, a majority of the Coun—
cil‘s members felt the motion
important enough to pass. The
vote on the motion was 16-7.

In the early part of the even
ing, various reports were hear
by the Council.

SC President Duane Krohnk
reported that the social coordin
sting committee, in a ineetin
on Monday, had defeated the mo
tion made and passed in th

Council that salaries for mem

bers of the social calendar com
mittee be abolished. The you
was eight against and seven fo
and among those in favor wer
the SC president, CofHP presi
dent, AWS board president anr
‘social coordinator.

Kenneth Christiansen, faculty
adviser to the Student Council
gave additional information con
cerning the junior comprehen
sive examinations to he give
next year. These exams, he said
will definitely be required a
all juniors and will count t
credits if passed.

A grade, such as is given in
all college courses, will be re-
corded on each individual's rca
cord. The credits will be given
to encourage each student to
prepare for these exams as
adequately as for my other
course.

Gary Thurston, chairman ol
the mechanics committee for th
constitutional convention,

cussed some of the problem
that are still being experience-
with the constitution. Foremos

 

tained in that document, yet
they will be voting for or a—
gainst its ratification next Mane
lday. He urged all students to
.,study it carefully; copies have
,been placed in all the halls.

SQ also approved a report
made by Peg Sutley, chairman
of the committee on academic
affairs, in which she asked for
the “gn»a'head" to make a study
of the humanities and historical
studies courses as they are now

being given at Grinnell. This re-
port, which will be presented to
lthe faculty committee in charge
‘of these courses, will be given
to every sophomore and fresh—

inlan by the end ‘of this year.
