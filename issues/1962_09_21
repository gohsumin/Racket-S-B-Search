Last week, Dr. Bowen :1 '|ill spolie to the problem,

tiie' quality of the Grinnell education by increasing the
size and competence of the faculty and bettering facilities,
future improvements will be and must he made by redefin-
ir ' the path which leads to a coherent liberal education.

makes a number of excellent suggestions
—— that the number of course examinations at Grinnell

lze cut by two»tllirds, that the number of credits required
1‘01: graduation he cut from 124 to 96 to allow more free-

dom for individual interest study, that admissions policies
be widened (by admission each year of 50 students who
rate low on college board scores but who Show talent in
other areas) and that comprehensive exam grades be
counted 50 per cent in computing final grade points.

Bowen

The President’s suggestions will not be received with
open arms by all. There are students who rely on a weekly
dosage of grades for security and there are faculty meme
bers who will cling to simpler and much less time consum—
iug‘ objective methods. These types will not be happy
withwvliat Dri Bowen suggests.

Others will feel that the suggested changes would still
fail to insure a completely free atmosphere for learning
7 an atmosphere free from all false sub-goals which any
system of evaluation is bound to foster to a certain extent.

However. I find Dr. Bowen's sue stions an intelli-
gent means of accomplishing one of the secondary but
nevertheless essential roles at a college ~— lhat of sort-
ing out good Students from poor ~ while assuring the
opportunity of each student to gain a liberal education
with as much freedom from the “tyranny of number "
as possible:

The only question I have to ask “when will the
suggestions become policy "" They are Ilot yet guaranteed a
place at Gl'innell hilt were put forth only [or discussion.
They have been presented to the Trustees and faculty
and will be distiiblited by Sigma Delta. Chi to the students
within the text 01' the Convocation address ill which they
were made.

I ask you to talk about them. Write the Scarlet and

about his proposals. It is from such discussion that colic
crete results will come.

’10 the Editor:

Now that we Grinncll students
are once again ﬁnding ourselves
ph» iiuy “settled," we must
qui :ly turn to the responsibili—
tl ~ which have been shunted
aside during these last several
days.

All of the organizations on
campus will Soon be activated
and once more serving the stu-
dents of Grinnell. Foremost a7
mong these organizations is the
Student Government Associa-
tion. I term tl‘it‘ SGA foremost
among siudcm organizations be-
cause of its ability to supplcc
merit or alter most facets oi
campus liic To those oi you7
especially the lrcshmenrwho are
not familiar wiih the operations
of the son I would simply rec
mark that the budget of this
student government totals over
$45,000.

THIS FACT is especially rele-
vant to the women of Grinnell
in that they die ip elect their
representatives to the Student
Senate this Coming Monday ever
ning. It is paramount that these
representatives be extremely
perceptive and patient, and pos
5055 a sense 01' responsibility
which provides a basis for sci-la
ice The Speaker or the Senate,
Telry Parssinen, and the Execu-
uve Cabinet all look lol‘\\'zu'(l
to meeting lhe‘newly c’l ambled
Senate this coming weck.

The work oi the BSA in gen-
oral and the Student Senate in
particular will undoubtedly inc
elude at ﬁrst simple organiza-
tional measures. Senate Commit-
iccs must be re-established and
resumed: SGA appointments
must be made to certain faculty
committees. and. pi course, class
officers must be elected.

Once these problems have
been removed, the student go'
el‘nment can turn its attention
to more weighty matters The
idea of a student represents
tive to the family, bringing to
them student opinion concerning
curriculum, is one which many

of us would like to see fulﬁlled. ’

I feel that it will only take a
mature demonstration of Grin-
nell students' concern m such
matters and we will be given
this opportunity ot' curriculum
expression.

As the upperclassmcn will re-
member, last spring the Grinnell
Siudcni Senate decided to have
the Grinnell Student Goveln-
ment Association remain in the
National Student Association. 11
was iclt that this organization
deser ed mor than one year to
make its {no cs meaningful to
Our campus.

THE NATIONAL Allan's Coin-
mittee. chaired by NSA repre-
sentative incl» Chapman, p-
enlly is meeting to determine
how best to assimilate the NSA
into our campus hie. I have
hopes that a i-aihei- broad pro
gram, integrating the programs
or many private organizations,
can be developed for the beneﬁt
oi a single interest group,

A further project of prime
importance will be the Execu-
tive Cabinet's task of evaluat-
ing' the present budget of the
SGA. We must give time to
organizations now to demon-
strate their need for SGA aid,
instead of wailing until the
hectic spring period when one
ﬁnds barely enough time to
pass cvcn a budget which is
almost identical to that. or the
prcviuiis year. If major chang-
es or re-emphdses are needed,
this winter is the lime to dis
cuss them.

Some of you may have no-
