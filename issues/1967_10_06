M. P. IAGKSON
0N MID EAST

By GERALD SWANSON

“The world is constantly on
a precipice and the Middle
Eastern crisis could push it over
the edge."

The importance or this prob-
lem to the countries directly
involved and to the world sit-
uation in general were the to
cal points of Hon. Colin Jack-
son’s lecture Tuesday evening
in the south lounge.

The Hon. Mr. Jackson, a
Labour Representative in Brl-
taiii's House of Commons and
Chairman of the Fabian Soci-
Ity‘s International Bureau, used
not only his knowledge as a
specialist in foreign aiiairs but
also that. of a Irequent visitor
to the Middle East in his
analysis or the problem.

His suggested solution to the
problem is that the Arabs and
the Jews negotiate under U.N.
auspices, with a realistic ap<
praisal of what each side has
to gain or lose in continuing
conflict,

"These negotiations must lead
to a pact which guarantees
Israel access to the Suez Canal
and the Gulf of Aquaba, re-
turns conquered lands to the
Arabs, and places the Holy City
under U.N. control,"

Mr. Jackson's visit to Grin-
nell was sponsored by the In-
ternational Studies Program
and the Departments of Politia
cal Science and History.

HETTLINGEII ON

SEXUAL

By ADRIENNE LEMMONS

Does love make it right? Dr.
Richard F. Hettllnger, author
of Living with Sex: The Stuv
dent’s Dilemma, addressed him-
self to this question in an hour-
long lectlure which high-lighted
his visit to Grinnell last week-
end.

Hettlinger made some twelve
hours of appearances, including
an informal discussion at Ex
Loco Parentis Saturday night,
a sermon in Herrick Chapel
Sunday morning, a meeting
with student government oili-
cials and other interested stu-
dents that atternoon, and a dis-
cussion in the South Lounge fol-
lowing his talk In ARI-i Audi-
torium.

In his lecture, Hettlinger took
iihe position that love some-
times does make it right, and
offered some guidelines {or de-
termining when this is the case.

Sex is oiten engaged in for
purely selfish reasons by peo-
ple who are incapable of true
affection, Love, which forms a
more appropriate context for
sex, implies a recognition of
the other person involved as a
personality and not merely as
a “convenient physical body",

Concern for the other person
involved will lead us to com
slder some of the ramifications
of the sexual relationship, which
extend far beyond the physr
cal act.

With today's trend toward
postgraduate study, premari-
Ilal intercourse is sometimes the
only adequate expression of love

VALUES

between couples whose mar-
riage, for economic reasons,
must be delayed, In cases like
this, avoiding intercourse oc-
casionally causes the couple to
become preoccupied with each
other as objects of unsatisiled
physical desire; in this manner
sexual attraction can obscure
other aspects of the personal-
ities involved.

On the other hand, difficul-
ties ot various kinds can arise
tram premarital coitus.

LOW 0N OPENS

By Don nacxan

The issue in favor this year
seems to be open dorms, and
that is a situation that Alice
Low, Dean of Women, very
much regrets.

Her position, which she
makes very clear, is that open
dorms, as an issue, is only one
of the aspects of on-campus
“living and total social interac-
tion.H

Because of her belief that
open dorms is only part of the
total issue, Dean Low l5 reti-
cent about discussing only that
issue. Her personal stand -
which, as she points out, is the
official stand of the administra-
tion or Grinnell — Is against

FIIGEITAUB RESIGNS
AS CoIHP PRESIDENT

RAWSON PROPOSAL PASSES

By BARRY ANCONA

Bill Fligeitaub resigned as
President of the Council of
House Presidents Wednesday.
In a speech to the Senate, Fligel-
taub cited “pressures for total
neglect of the . i . rules” on
north campus, and said that he
considered “an irritating rule a
poor excuse for shunning one's
duty to honesty and responsi-
bility."

(Tex't ot Fligeltaub's speech
Dn page 7)

The RaWsDn Hall Proposal
Ior open dorms and a human
values class passed in the Sen-
ate when Speaker Phil Barten-
thai broke the twentystwenty
deadlock.

Before debate was opened on
the Proposal, Bertenthal ex-
plained that the Senate could
take several courses: the bill
could be rejected entirely; it
could be passed as a resolu-
tion; it could be sent to the
AWS Board and C of HP to
initiate the chain or thirty day
consideration periods that lead
through the faculty and the
president to the tnlstees; it
could be sent to faculty com-
mittees. or course, it the pro-

posal were sent to faculty com-
mittees, it would be broken upil
opens going to the Student Life
committee and the course gm
ing to the Academic Life com-
mittee.

The proposal was debated tor
thirty minutes before the vote.
David Swee (West) called the
proposal “minute and lragmen-
ted” and said that opens war
“not a primary issue” at this
time. Roger Koenker (Smith)
said the proposal contained too
much, that the course should
be eliminated, and that ho
couldn’t see "forcing professor:
with distinguished academic
records" to teach it. Darcy
Kelly (Main) noted that “thl
Deans say we want Ireedom
without guidance." The course
is the guidance needed, and
she felt that we should “makQ
the poor professors demean
themselves by talking about peo-
ple instead oi historyi”

Ray Horn, author oi the pun
posal, answered questions and
debated the detractors oi the
bill. The most interesting ques-
tion came from Derrick TePaske
(East) who asked “Do you ex-
pect Leggett to pass this?"
Hom said no.

MORE OPENS TALK

Discussion oi open dorms reached a new level of absurdity
this week with the adoption of the Rawson Proposal by the Senate.
Passage of the proposal demonstrated that President Leggett’s
speech two weeks ago missed the ears of those people to whom
it was olficlally directed.

The president has made it clear that extensions of open dorms
will come, at the earliest, after many other major changes are
made in the structure of student living. We must agree that there
are other areas of student life equally in need of improvement, and
that if all improvements other than increased opens were made,
Grinnell would not be such a bad place after all.

Continued pressure for open dorms can only disturb the faculty
and administration, to say nothing of the students who would like
to see energy devoted to improvements that will be made

As for tho advocation of revolution, let us remember that we
are a small, private, isolated school, and that the only result of
a student uprising is likely to be a lot of exstudehts.

The 5&5 is in favor of an extension of open dorms to 24 hours
every day. But given the unyielding attitude in Hurling Basement,
we must he content, temporarily, to work on Grinnell's other prob—
‘9is

And bear in mind, fellow hypocrites, that the ﬁght is not for
open dorms — it is for legal open dorms.

ENCAMPMENT AND THE REPORT

it is unfortunate that the report of the Faculty Committee on
Academic Life will not be ready for Encampment. The weekend
retreat would have provided the ideal time for students, faculty,
and administrators to discuss the report and exchange ideas.

Serious Encampment discussion of academic life (and that
seems to be an all inclusive term) will be limited by the fact that
the report, although not here yet, is coming soon. And when it does
finally reach the students, it looks like it will be almost the end
of the semester, is time when the strain of academic life precludes
discussion of it.

NOlSE AT
MAIN DOOR
To the Editor:

On a campus where matters
of importance to the academic
and social structure of the COL-
lege community are being ier—
vently discussed and debated,
I wonder if I am justified in
mentioning a subject such as
"courtesy” To be blunt. people
returning through Main door
from midnight on 'till three
cm. are noisy and boisterous
to the degree at which sleep
for a typical resident of Main
hall has become an impossibil-
ity.

With the institution of tho
rio—hours policy, it is, of course,
natural and expected for people
to be using Main door trorn
midnight on. And any person
would agree that conversation
at Main door is no oddity, but
rather a normal thing. The
point that i want to make is
that when such conversation
reaches an intensity at which
the residents of Main cannot
get to sleep, even after closing
the windows, a problem defi-
nitely exists.

I would like to request that
individuals e i i h o I conclude
their laughing, singing, and
talking a iew hundred feet
away from Main door, or that
they substantially decrease
their volume upon approaching
Main door.

By Neil Fischer

American campus creative writing usually has two outlets —
collegersponsored workshops and lavatory walls.

But at Grinnell conscientious B846 sanitation engineers wipe
the slick walls of Forum privies clean of the day’s poetics late
each night. And every year students await a long-anticipated cre-
olive writing course which never seems to materialize.

And while the “History of Grinnell College” lecture perennially
bills this place as “a continuation of the New England tradition of
small liberal arts colleges,” it is an entertaining footnote to (his
history of hired education that all New England Colleges and uni<
versities now offer one or more classes in creative writing.

Smith College has five creative writing courses and seminars;
Amherst has four; the University of Massachusetts has nine};
MiTJ'. even has one,

For that matter We never heard of a college — save Grinnell
— that doesn’t offer some sort oi creditable work in written cra-
ativity.

But the Howard oi Poweshlelr County, I guess, doesn't see the
med for nary a wriﬁng course.

I wonder why Parsons has t .

We, of course, have our wri ng labs and our one journalism
professor and — believe it or not — one course in our catalogue
which might — incorrectly — be imputed as a writing course.

And so irate professors who read the fine print in our fine bul-
letin will, i suppose, write in correcting me: '

“Well, Mr. Fischer, I’m surprised at you. We have Expository
and Narrative Writing — that is to say, English 204 — and how
dare you print that, anyhow?"

But before you correct me, Mr. Crossett, I might tell you that
English 204 this year has been mutated into a class in Formal
Rhetoric with little or no creativity required or even encouraged.

While Jaundice — my erstwhile muse of joumalism — and I
were planning this syndicated outrage, Joe Krausman pounced on
us with the same — all too valid — complaint.

“it’s a crime. It’s an insult. Tt‘s shockingly incredible that a
college of this caliber doesn’t have a course in creative writing . t .
And I think the reason is that English professors are usually
pedants,” quoth he,

Krausman tells me that English departments generally have
two objections to teaching creative w "ng: (l_) they think good
writing is God-given (Hello, again, Mr. C) ahd (2) all of the profes-
sure "would raihei- criticize great writing than help students pro-
duce good wri ng"; in other words, nobody will teach it.

Great writing may be God-given, but as John Ciardi mused in
a recent Saturday Review, “t . . even a shmoo might recognize
that writers, whatever their divine condition, learn from one an-
otherr”

And re somebody to teach the course, 1 guess while we dish
out a million dollars plus for a PE. complex (which most people
justify because “we can always use it") it takes a poverty-stricken
resident advisor (Krausman) and a Russian professor (George
Young) to organize and finance an oifrcampus writers workshop.

Again, I emphasize that this isn’t my problem. My creative
outlet is this column, and that — believe me — is a problem.

But for the students flocking to the writer's workshop on Sun-
day afternoon and to Paul Jones’ poetry workshop because there’s
no creativity on campus, it is a problem.

And I suppose when the Haveman manifesto comes out pro
claiming a new academic environment at Grinnell, the lltemry
artists have to go back to the Forum johns and suifer and hope
that at least E&G will read their poems before they scour them
away

PHILOSOPHERS. NOT PARTISANS.
or MAKE MORE THAN LOVE

“It is now time for the stu-
dent body to stop having to de-
fend their point of view, and
have the administration start
delending theirs." Besides be-
ing to a large extent trite, this
statement is also indicative of
a general change of emphasis
in methods of creating change.
This opinion, voiced by many
dissident students. is held also
by many thinkers not ‘under
thirty.‘ ln a recent article in
the Humanist, Leslie Fiedler
said, “Maybe it is not the
young today who need defend
ing, but the old.”

This attitude is most clearly
demonstrated in the contro-
Versy on campus concerning
'rule philosophy,’ but it is also
relevant in a subtler area of
concern: creativity. There are
many ideas about creativity,
what it means, What its causes
are, what its aim is; Robinson
Jeffers said, “Values or Cre-
ativity come only out of vio-

lance"; a iriend of mine wrote
to me this summer, “Creativ-
ity comes only out of disturbing
tensions"; and there is the old
saw. “Democracy is built on

the clash or opposing views.”

Now Grinnell is obviously not
a democracy, either with a big
or little ‘d'. But it can be one
if only in the sense that it is
the place for the ‘clashing or
opposing views.’ for the ‘crea-
tion of disturbing tensions,’ and
for 'violent creativity.’ What is
this thing. ‘education’, anyway?
It should be. at least to my
mind, the process of teaching
or in some cases forcing a per-
son to be creative.

How many students are will-
ing to question the relevance of
the educational process, or the
meaning of grades, or of the
certain courses at Grillllell, to
ask whether or not course nin-
terial is worth reading in some
cases, to say ‘I have a belief

and I challenge anyone to prove
that I’m wrong?’ Perhaps the
problem is not so much the lack
ot communication as Mr, Ru-
dolph suggests, but, looking into
the causes, the unwillingness to
communicate; most students
around here are so dispassion-
ate that they become illnnels
tor the history or art, the his-
tory of philosophy, the history
of history, but rarely artists,
philosophers, or h i s t o r t a n s
themselves. Seemingly, nobody
wants to know ‘why' anymore.
Isn't it, then, possible to cre—
ate some disturbing tenslon
somewhere along the line? I
think that it Is, and since the
greater number of the senior
scholars at Grinnell are either
willing or unable to do it, it is
up to the students themselves.
It is necessary to remember
that the opposition or actions is
generally called war, the oppo-
sitioll or ideas, creativity.

 

A SANGUINE TRIBUTE TO COLLEGE MEDICINE

 

T0 iiEhii'ii hi

By DON WINNEY

One of the least appreciated
institutions at a college is usue
ally its medical help. I mean
we usually think such profes-
sional care is one of our un-
a n u m e r ate d constitutional
rights. But no, as the AMA
president: so cogently stated,
such fine college care is a
privilege, yes even a providen-
tIal blessing. Why I know a
friend who just raved about the
medical care he got at the
smallest liberal arls college
west at the South Carolina tide-
water,

One day, at a rather low ebb
i believe, this young scholar
stumbled somewhat dazed into
the office of the good Doctor,
one or the college town's proud
practitioners — a kind of pa<
ternal Peyton Place iigure high-
ly recommended by the nice
nurse of the college health can
(er,

“Excuse me,“ said the stu-
dent, “Please excuse me, I
hope you don't mind, bllt while
playing badminton I inadverte
ently slipped on the birdie and
somewhat foolishly I'm airaid
cracked my head. Perhaps an
aspirin . . ."

"Why you poor dear!” cried
the nurse, rushing to him,
“Yes, of course, but first. fill
out this eight page insurance
form in triplicate.”

The student searched for his
pen while in his right hand he
gently cradled his head. Just
then, the good Doctor happily
emerged from his ofﬁce.

“0h, Doctor," Cried the
nurse. rushing to him, “A head
injury, Doctor. It looks just aw-
ful.” ‘

“Very nice," murmured the
Doctor, gently lingering the
hair.

“No. Doctor,” 5 a i d the

nurse, disengaging herself. “His
head.”

”What?" He glanced down at
the student with a benign, al-
most paternal expression, then
drew the nurse close and WhlS<
pered, ”Is the kid insured?"
The nurse nodded.

”Hmmmm,” mused the Doc~
tor, “Perhaps an aspirin. .

The nurse hurriedly fetched
it. “Thank you.” said the doc-
tor, gulping it. “And now, kid,
just fill out that insurance
farm.”

“But sir." protested the stu«
dent, somewhat diilidently,
"Excuse me, but I just can't
seem to think or read or to-
member anything."

“You must have a test to-
morrow," suggested the good
man, “Perhaps you need a psy-
chlatrist."

“N0.” said the student, “It's
just that my head hurts." He
shyly wiped his wet hand on
his trousers. “Excuse me for
staining your rug like that.”

“Quite all right,“ replied the
Doctor, “Just check the box on
page three marked ‘Oiiice
Dumages‘." He slipped a com-
forting arm around the nurse.
“And try not to track it
around.” he said.

The student started illling out
the form. but suddenly his arm
and neck began shaking.

hdﬁii

“You see, Doctor." explained
the student. "You see I have
these — like seizures.”

The nurse suddenly began
fainting. “Now, now." soothed
the Doctor, cradling the nurse,
gently, "You shouldn't shock
the. poor dear like that. That's
not a very nice word, now is
it?"

The student, rather ungra-
clously, he later admitted, be-
gan writhing on the floor.

“You do have a student union,
don't you?" asked the Doctor,
“where the kids dance?"

The student nodded several
times while clawing the carpet.

“Well," said the Doctor.
“Just wander over. You'll (it
right in." With professional
skill the good man felt for the
nurse’s heart. “And please
come back soon,” he begged.
He ielt tor it again. “That’li
he just eight bucks, but don’t
worry,” he assured him, “your
insurance covers everything.
Otherwise I would've charged
you cash.”

The student was greatly
thankful for that, for in his hur-
ry he had iorgolten his wallet.
He grateiully twitched his way
out the door while the good
man thoughttully comiorted his
nurse. “Excuse me." begged
the doctor, “let me feel it
again,”

A STUDENT OPINION

TRY it} UNDERSTAND

By SAMMIE FLETCHER and KAREN FRANK

This past Monday we heard a recording of a speech made by
Malcolm X in Detroit in 1963, We suddenly realized that the stark
world of reality was passing us by. because we had been apathetic
in the true Grinnell spirit. We had built our own little dream world,
truly insulated from the problems of the outside. We knew that
things outside were bad, but we had been sheltered by the so-
called liberal atmosphere here.

Malcolm x has been represented, untortunately, as a preacher
of racial hatred — his ideology compared to that of the Nazis. Only
selected parts of his speeches had been revealed to the general
public e parts which led to rejection oi his views by many people.

In this speech, we found nothing with which we could argue.
He saw revolution from a historical point of View citing as exam-
ples, the Russian, American. and Chinese revolutions. II was, to
him, evident that a true revolution demanded bloodshed, demanded
hatred of one's enemy, and demanded an uncompromising aspira-
tion toward a goal. This is contrary to Negro leaders who preach
non-violence, but in complete accord with the new milltants such
as Stokely Carmichael.

Malcolln X and Carmichael have the same View toward turn-
ing the other cheek. For years the white man has expected the
Negro to be patient and grateiul for the little concessions that he
made. The white man could tight lor his rights — the Negro had
to Wait passively. Now, the white man is alarmed because more
and more Negroes are not waiting passively. Every white man is
born with his rights, but Negroes have to prove that they are
worthy of them. And the white establishment determines worth.

Malcolm X also pointed to the large number of Negroes who
right in American wars. Is it iair ior them to fight tor a nation
that deprives them of their citizenship and returns them to in
homeland where their churches are bllrned, their brothers are
lynched and they are met with scorn?

We believe that the civil rights movement is dying because
many of Malcolm X’s pmcepts weren't iollowed. He realized that
black men had to unite, that they had to divorce themselves from
the white power and money structure, that they had to develop
racial pride, and that their leaders had to receive their support
from the people, not the establishment.

Gradually, the black power movement is replacing the non-
violent civil rights movement. Civil rights legislation is merely on
the books, Congress laughed the rat control bill off the floor, but
found riot-control legislation more appealing. More people are
iinding an answer in black power and violence, because the situ-
ation has not changed. A black revolution is believed to be inev-
itable — there will be no Sitting back cumplacently for another
hundred years.

But where do we go from here? There seems to be no hope in
further legislation, no hope at the conference table, and no hope
(or understanding, Suddenly each individual is forced to make a
choice —— black or white, 3 choice which has been determined at
birth. There is no place for one DI us, a black moderate. Does she
turn her back on her people and be labeled an Uncle Tom, or does
she become a militant young Negro torgetting her white triendsi|
And can the other feasibly remain a white liberal in a black revtr
lution that sees all Whites the same Way, or will she be Content to
defend her home in suburbia?

Now is almost too late, but we aren't ready to give up. If
everyone would care enough to try to understand the problem, we
believe there would still be hope (or reaching a solution.

'Grinnell College has been a-

man and woman involved is A
complex matter. Lester Kiriren-
dall, in a sandy 0! this prob-
lem, found that in several in-
stances a relationship was
weakened, or even broken, as a
result of intercourse. How this
happens is not clear. When it
happens, the girl is oiten in a
difficult position: many men
who have no qualms about re-
ducing the supply of virgins
prefer to marry girls with no
sexual experience, or no exper-
ience with men other than
themselves.

S e r i o u s misunderstandings
can result from physiological
and psychological differences
between the sexes, unless the
intentions of the individuals cori-

SCARLET AND BLACK

cemed are completely under-
stood. Hettlinger cited a Kin-
sey study showing that the
need of men for physical sata
isiaction in sex reaches its peak
in the late teens, while this
peak in women occurs about
ten years later.

This means that the college-
age man is likely to be con-
cerned largely with sexual de-
sire, while the girl will more

probably be thinking in terms

of a lasting relationship. while
her gestures may be intended
to show her affection for him,
he might interpret them as sig-
niiying sexual excitement. Be-
ing excited himself, he may
find it impossible no stop when
she asks him to. While he can
get a purely physical enjoyment
from sex, she cannot, and may
be disgusted by sexual actions

which do not express love. if he
sincerely loves her, he must
keep these differences in mind
if he is to avoid forcing his
desires on her.

Despite medical advances in
the area of birth control, one
premarital sexual liaison in
ﬁve results in an accidental
pregnancy. Since those who are
most promiscuous are usually
the most careful in their con-
traceptive measures, they are
less likely to get "in trouble"
than those who don’t really plan
to have intercourse, but prog-
ress to it from petting.

The ethical problems of stu-
dent sexual relationships. says
Hettlinger, can be directly at-
tributed to the mixedup moral-
ity of the older generation. By

DANFORTH
0N CATALYSTS

'A catalyst is a chemical
agent which acts to speed up
specific reactions. They are
found in the cells of plants and
animals, and take part in th-
metabolic process. Catalyst!
are also used by industry in the
manufacture of such products
as ammonia and plastics, and
in the cracking of petroleum to
gasoline.

This last reaction was the
Iubject of last week's lecture
by Dr. Joseph Danforth of the
chemistry department. Dr,
Danforth worked for Universal
Oil Products before coming to
Grinnell, and has conducted re—
search here on the petroleum
catalysts, the silica-aluminas.

He Spoke on his most recent
attempts to discover the site on
the molecule where catalytic
cracking takes place, using as
lecture aids models of [he
crystal structure of the zeoiile
clays (the same as the struc-
ture of the modern synthetic
silicaraluminas).

In his research, Dr. Danforth
found, purely by chance, that
only upon the addition of water
would his catalysts react (in
this case with isopropyl hen-
zene). The degree oi reaction
was recorded by a device cre-
ated by Dr. Dantonh which
measured the quantity of the
reaction products that came
off. He concluded that the wat-
er removes phenol (benzene
plus a hydrogen atom) and
leaves a hydroxide radical at
the specific site of activity.
This site is as yet undeter-
mined.

Qr the final conﬁrmation of his
results by means of infra-red

his best satiric film, which has

in support of her position,
she refers to at least one na-
tional questionnaire, and her
personal conversations w i t h
many psychiatrists and other
Deans oi colleges.

Prominent a m o n g these
sources is Dr. Famsworth, as
sociated with Harvard Univer—
sity and M.I.T. In a conversa-
tion with her last year, he indi-
cated that, given a choice, a
college should not institute
open dorms. As a professional
psychiatrist with much experi-
ence with college students, he
said bluntly: “Bedrooms and
balhrooms should remain seg-
regated.”

Dean Low turther pointed out
that obviously, the fact that
few colleges have open dorms
indicates the degree of opposi-
tion to them

Asked about datinitlve works
on the subject, she said that
because the question is so new,
there have really been no con-
clusive studies made. Even if
there were such information.
she cautioned against a reli-
ance an outside studies of sla-
tistics, warning that, because
at the great difference in col-
leges, a study in another col-
lege might not necessarily
have relevance to this college.

Considering the available in-
formation, Dean Low sees no
evidence that open dorms aid
the academic processes, and
she stated that any innovations
at Grinnell would be made with
the goal in mind oi improving
the academic processes,

FLIGELTAUB’S SPEECH T0 SENATE

Last spring, after much de«
liberation, i decided to seek the
office of the President of the
Council of House Presidents. I
recognized the problems assucl‘
ated with the office: however,
I was optimistic, and thought
that through a conscientious ef-
fort. I could iuliill the respon-
sibilitiies, minimize the difficul-
ties, and provide leadership both
for student government and one
student body. As I became more
involved in SGA, I sensed more
acutely the conflict between the
responsibilities and the prob-
lems. Yet. I continued to work
because I believed the conflict
could be resolved without any
drastic personal decision. I now
have arrived at the point that
I can see no resolution for my-
self and can foresee only the
impairment of the C of HP and
SGA leadership if I do not make
that personal decision,

The immediate factor forcing
my decision has developed from
my philosophy concerning stu-
dent responsiblhnies and com-
munity rules. especially those
relating to the open dorms
question. Unlike several student
leaders who have adopted a
philosophy of hall rights, l have
not and, as l interpret the role
of the C of HP presidency, I
can not. I, therefore, have had
the following policy about open
dorms: if I have passed a wo-
man entering the hall or if i
have heard a woman's voice
in the room or it people have
complained to me about the
noise from a coeducational par-
ty in a room. I have asked the
men involved m remove the
women from the hall. I also
have explained to the people in-
volved that after three separ-
ate warnings. I would send them
to the judicial council, (To say

the least, this policy irritates
ntany students and officers who
disdain their responsibilities.)

Yet, with my election. 1 as-
sumed a greater obligation to
be concerned not only with hall
rights and rules but also com-
munity rules and rights. Sim-
ply because a particular ma-
jority in a hall or his officers
decide not to recognize a rule,
I do not lose suddenly my re<
sponsibilities to the entire com<
muniuy. The inseparability of
student responsibilities student
government responsbi ies and
community responsibilities seem
so fundamental to me that l can-
not compromise on this princi-
pie.

Some people have asked me
why, after three years at Grin-
nell, this principle has become
so sacmsanct to me. i have
no definite answer to this ques-
tion. other than that this office
has stimulated some thought in
my formerly indifferent mind.
I, however, do know that now.
both as an individual and as a
student leader, I can not ac-
cept an attitude that completely
negates a rule because it is
disagreeable to several people.
I consider an irritating rule a
poor excuse ror shunning one’s
duty to honesty and responsi<
bility.

Yet, some people have been
pressuring me to adopt that at«
titude. Now, what are the im<
plicahions and alternatives in
their demand. One alternative
would be to compromise the
fundamental principle of stu-
dent responsibility and honesty
within the college community.
Another alternative would be
for me to fightl and defend thiﬂ
principle. with all the conse-
quences that might emerge from
the struggle. A third alterna-

tive would be to reslgn from
my office.

As I stated, the principle of
student honesty and responsibib
ity is essential to my philosophy
about student life in the Grim
nell community. Student parti-
cipants in non-academic areas
is primarily earned or deserved
rather than inherent in the col-
lege situation. i do not believe
in flouting a college rule be-
cause it seems to infringe upon
my freedom, 1 do believe in
changing the rule through dis-
cussion and argumentation —
even if these processes require
much more thought and time.
Thus, especially when l have
the honor to he in a student
leadership role which should de-
mand more responsibility than
the normal individual struggled
with, I can not turn away and
acquiese to pressures for total
neglect of the rule or rules.
You see, therefore. that com-
promise is an unacceptable an-
swer for my problem.

To light and to deiend my
philosophy were the second al-
ternative I suggested. The idea
of a struggle does noti frighten
me, for I love to accept chal<
leiiges of this nature. Nor do
I fear the possibility oi dls<
covering that my views are those
of the minority — after being
Jewish and Catholic for twenty-
one years, I have learned not
to be disturbed with having
minority ideas. I, however, am
reluctant to force discussion of
this principle at this time for
two reasons. During the com-
ing months the entire com-
munity will be deciding on
major reforms in academic,
social, and residential areas.
Stiudent leaders will have the
opportunity to play vital role:

in this decision-making process.
Part oi the students‘ success
here will be due to their ilex-
lbility, ie., their ability to give
and lake in discussions about
certain subjects, To have stu-
dent leaders and the student
body immediately c o m m i t
themselves on this principle
quite probably would hamper
them in the cmcial period
ahead. If student leaders were
to agree with me, they might
lose student support It student
leaders were to disagree with
me, faculty and administrative
aupport might diminish, i am
unwilling to rislr these possibii~
lties.

i also tool that student honesty
and responsibility must be dis-
cussed in the context oi the
entire lite beret Were my p0<
silion to challenge the students
to respond to these important
questions during the next iew
days, the debates and discus-
alone probably would include
these questions relative to open
dorms and not relative to all
the factors that should be in«
volved. i hope that, when the
Committee on Student Attairs
announces its proposals within
the next couple of months, con-
atructive discussions about hon-
sexy and responsibility can oc-
our and will not exclude any
relevant topics Unfortunately,
i fear that such discussions are
nearly impossible at this point
in the process of change,

For these two reasons — ——
my desires to grant as much
ﬂexibility as possible to student
leaders and to have discussions
which are positive and which
consider topics not as isolated
iactnrs but as parts of a whole
— I am unwilling to press ior
immediate student action on a
principle which i believe Is so
vital to the Grinnell community
or to nearly any community.

The third solution to the con-
ilict betlween responsibilities
and problems was to resign. I
shall not attempt to rationalize
this kind of a decision I iully
realize that my resignation does
not solve the problems I recog-
nize that i only help to mini~
mize and to avoid temporarily
the conﬂict by selecting this
third alternative Yet, i can not
compromise without compromis—
ing part oi myselit Nor do I
discern the probable results oi
an immediate iight as beneﬁcial
to what may emerge before
Ric, Leida, and Phil leave oi-
iice. Resignation seems to be
the only alternative leit. I,
thereiore, — with reluctance —

announce my resignation as C
of HP President, effective as
of [Olllgllir

Beiore i leave, however, 1
should like to present htieily a
iew personal comments and ob-
servations about student gov~
ernment and the student body
at Grinnell.

As I told you, my resigna-
tion merely postpones the dis»
cussion and quite probably the
fight about student responsibil»
ity, Whatever be the suggested
changes ior the residential sys
tem, the question about respon-
sibility and honesty in regard
to community rules will have
to be answered, We avoid It
now but all oi as will con-
iront it during the next
few months. To paraphrase
John F. Kennedy, not only do
the problems of courage and
conscience concern every oiiice—
holder at Grinneli College, how-
ever humble or mighty, and to
whomever be may be responsi-
ble —- voters, a council, is
board, or a political machine.
They concern as well every per-
son in our community — and
they concern those who do not
vote, those who take no inter-
est in government, those who
have only disdain ior the stu-
dent leaders and their jobs.
For, at Grinnell, every person,
regardless oi his interest in
politics, “holds oiiice"; every
one at us is in a position oi
responsibility; and, in the ﬁnal
analysis, the kind of college
99mmunity we get depends up-
on how we iuliiii those respon-
sibilities.

By this i do not mean that
more student politicians are
needed. Since my election, 1
have argued that one major
weakness in student govern»
ment is the abundance oi stu-
dent politicians. those people
who are eager to assume power
and to create pressure for per-
sonal gains or ego satisfaction.
Student government and tho
student body desparately need
more dedicated thlnket's such
as nio, beida, and Phll —
people who act only after cw
iul objective consideration at
all relevant iacts.

My only direct suggestion to
the Senate and members oi the
C oi HP concerns the way in
which many oi you interpret
your roles primarily as retleo
tors oi student opinion. 1 be-
lieve you were elected because
students hava conﬁdence in
your ability to exercise your
judgment to determine what are
their own best interests. (JFK)
To do this you sometimes must
lead, other times must inform,
and occasionally must ignore

student opinion. The student
body, or course, is the ultimate
judge. But you, through dedi-
cation, honesty, tllougbtiulness,
and responsibility, mtlst be wiil<
ing to inﬂuence and direct that
iinal judge.

Finally, I want to assure you
that my services and my philos-
Dphies will be available Ito any
oi you, especially to members
of the Executive Cabinet, To
tell you that l resign without
disappointment would be a he.
i regret that i have to leave
student government this way.
I, however, do not resign from
student participation or student
actions. Each oi us ultimately
has responsibility which he can
not deny. Each of its will have
on solve the conﬂict which i
avoid now.

PIONEER GRIDDERS
AND HARRIERS LOSE

By BARRY ANCONA

The Pioneer football team suf-
iei'ed its second defeat of the
season at the hands of the
Cornell Rams at Mt. Ven‘lon
last Saturday. The 27-24 loss
was just one paint off last
year's defeat score.

The Grinnell gridders out-
rushed Cornell l15 yards to 108,
but fell short on pass yardage
and punting. The Pioneers com-
pleted 17 of 32 passes for 229

ards to Cornell’s 14 for 27:
55. There were no intercep<
tions. The Pioneers had one punt
b 1 o ck e d, and averaged 29.9
yards, while the Rams kicked
It 40,7.

Coach Bowers saw a weak‘
defense and the inability to
platoon as Gl'innell‘s major
Emblems. Two defensive mis.
lies gave the Rams two of
their touchdowns. The small
size of the team makes sub<

tier. difficultrand “playeg
who give 110 percent on each
play will get tired before the
and of the game.“

punting duel for the first nine
tninutes of play, the Rams

They kicked the extra point.

touchdown when Rich Weeks
ran right end for 45 yards and
itVeeks hit Dave Luthy on a 13

nside the Cornell ten, With
1:26 left in the first quarter,
Dick Lamb took the ball four
yards for the score. Kent
tl‘homson’s exilra point pass to
Bill Wedding failedl 7-6.

Dick Musser’s punt from deep
in Pioneer land was blocked.
and the Rams took over on the

or the game, Grinnell held for
three downs inside their own
ten. A field goal attempt went
wide. With 5:38 left in the first
half, Weeks ran 15 yards to the
one, and Lamb took it over for
his (and Grinnell’s) s e c n n d
score of the game, The extra

int pass (Thomson to
Eighwartz) was incomplete. 7-12,

Cornell’s Matthews caught a
pass, broke two tackles, and
scored on a 55 yard play. The
Extra point failed, but the Rams
were ahead at the half, 13-12.

largest field in the four-year
history or the event, have

fundamentals of contract in the shortest, least painful, amount of
time. A schedule of the lectures will be available on the Forum
Bulletin Board for those who may wish to attend only one or two
lectures.

Classes will generally consist of a half-hour lecture and your

GRAY MATTER

By BILL GRAY

Another week of i, M. football has passed and the players now
move into the final week of the schedule. There was something
good for everyone last week.

Langan won a game thus bringing joy to the hearts of those
on campus who favor change. For those who prefer the status quo,
Dibble Continued to win, a phenomenon which evokes about as
much response as a sunrise on a cloudy day..lltith the Yankees,
the Celtics, and the Packers all having difficult times, though, it

 

'1: always nice to have something reliable to restore your faith in

the order of the universe.

Highlight of this week’s play will be the second annual Bird
Bowl pitting Clark against Cowles. The trophy which goes to the
winner is the Dibble eagle, which appears somewhat incongruous
but apparently does not concern the participants.

i didnt get a chance to see a girls' softball game due to the
fact that they cancelled all games after hearing I might attend one

. of them. The next attraction is a sockey (hoccer?) game between

die boys‘ soccer team and the girls’ field hockey team. Don’t bet
against the girls (especially if they get to use their clubs)
