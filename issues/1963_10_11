Last week's S843 Contained a column I wrote
about the Student Nonvrolcnt Coordinating Com-

told me tliat>polch brutality does not actually
exist. except in verv isolated instances. I do not
believe it.

In Amm'icus, Georgln, this August, three SNCC

workers were arrested, beaten repeatedly by po—
lice, and chll'ged with ”inciting to insurrection,"
a capital Crime in Geol‘ ' , This charge was last
'sed against Communist Party organizers in the
930’s. _The three were, leading a pcacelul dem-
o -ti-alion in the Negro section 01‘ Americns.
Other demonstrators and spectators were beaten
with clubs and kicked by police. About ten re»
Quired stitches to close head wounds One man
suffered a broken leg, when police officers stood
on h arms and legs and beat him with clubs.
Electric cattle prodders left burns on many of
the demonstrators.

In Albany, Georgia, a Negro minister was

These are not the most brulal and disgusting

they get the point across Anyone who believes
that police brutality to Negroes in the South
as not a reality simply has his head stuck in

And why doesn't somebody do something a-
