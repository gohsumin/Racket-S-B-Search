Vol. LXXIV

Grinnoll, Iowa. Friday, February l0, i967

 

By Steve Kent

Last December I was among 100 co-signers of an open letter
to President Johnson. My fellow signers were all student body presi-
dents at their respective colleges and universities with the excep-
tion of several who were editors or their campus newspapers. Our
purpose was to alert the President to the growing skepticism on
many campuses concerning our present policy in Vietnam and to
initiate a responsible dialogue between the administration and the
American student population in the hope that most students’ doubt:

might prove unwarranted.

In response to our letter, each of the signers
received a letter irom Secretary of State Dean
Rusk in reply to our original question, inviting a

select group from the one hundred of us to come
to Washington to discuss the Vietnam situation.
Tuesday, January 31, was set as the date for our

conference with the Secretary,

early the next day went on to Dunbarion College,
where we were to gather prior to our meeting

A group of eighteen early arrivals had met the previous week-
end to draft a second letter to Secretary Rusk and to establish ten-
tatively the guidelines ior our Tuesday meeting Tuesday morning
the inte arrivals, including myself, were brieled by the planners.
Several delegates were designated as spokesmen in order to insure
that certain questions would be raised in the time allowed us with
the Secretary, It was also decided that we would agree to an inform-
al discussion arrangement and promise not to publicly quote or
represent the Secretary's views as expressed in our discussion

Our meeting with the Secretary lasted almost two hours. The
exchange was lively and touched on many aspects of the Vietnam

Judicial Study Group Proposes
Complete Court Reorganization

By Jan Hale

A group organized late last
semester to study the College
judicial system is preparing
proposals for a complete re<
organization oi the judicial
structure. The study group,
initiated by Primary Court
Magistrates Tim Daily and Lin-
da Neal, has been meeting
regularly since the beginning
of the second semester.

in addition to Daily and
Miss Neal, the study group in-
cludes Chairman of the Facul-
ty Joseph F. Wall and Deans
James Stauss, Alice Low, Eu-
gene Thompson and Richard
Winters.

The group’s tentative propos
als reflect a desire to eliminate
overlapping jurisdictions such
as now exist between the stu<
dent courts and the Faculty
Committee on Student Aliairs.
Proposals would also eliminate
such dual and conflicting roles
as now exist in the case of
the deans, who act both as
counselors and disciplinarians,
and in the case oi the faculty
committee, which acts in both
a judicial role and a policy.
making rule. These changes, it

is hoped, would reduce the kind
of reverberating tension the
community experiences as me
es are moved from one level
of judicial authority to another.

The study group is planning
to hold a joint meeting with
the Faculty committee on Stu-
dent Affairs, the Executive
Cabinet and the other members
of the student government. Fol-
lowmg this meeting, the group
hopes to present deiinite pm
posals for judicial reform to
the administration and the stu-
dent body.

Since December, 1965, every
case of illegal visitation handled
by the FCSA has resulted in
suspension or expulsion, Asso-

A New Name for the S&B

The Sam stair is planning to change the paper’s name in the
next law weeks, We are looking for an appropriate new name and

Itlggestions aie welcome.

We think it’s time the paper’s name represents what it’s sup-
ed to —— the college newspaper. Most newspaper names signify.
two or three words, the locale oi the paper and the fact that it

relates the news, to. the Milwaukee Journal, the Antioch Record,
the Yale Daily News, and the London Times. The present name.
Scarlet or Black, falls a little short on both counts. Nobody knows

What the colors mean,

We think the Grinnell College paper should have a name more
In keeping with the serious character or the school. Colors might
be lino tor telling toothell teams apart, but they have little sig-
niﬁcance to the present day Grinnell College School colors, like
high school and the old Grinnell May Day celebrations, are pretty
much a thing of the past. Even the staid old Alumni Scarlet &
Black is going to change its name and format in the near future.

The start has considered naming the paper the Griiineu Journal
or the Grinnell Weekly; however, we are open to iurther sug-
gestions. Submit ideas to the 5&1! box in the post ofﬁce.

Senate Satire

To the Editor:

1 respoctiuliy suggest that in
her letter last week Miss Cuss-
ler completely missed the point
of my senate satire and the
pointlessness of the revolution-
lry Speech.

My article was directed at
those individuals who are more
concerned with meaningless
rhetoric and 19th century clich-
es, 6. g. “social upheaval,"
than with a specific discussion
of issues that contront this col~
loge, it was directed against
those who uncritically accept
such cliches and act without
clearly - deﬁned and me an-
ingrul goals. it was directed
against an absurd intensity tor
words rather than for sub-
stance, and against an absurd
manner engendered by that
misplaced intensity. Finally, it
was written hecausa it we take
student government too serious-
ly, is we don‘t laugh at our mis-
takes and correct them, we will
never stop talking in clichei
tind the administration will nev-
er stop laughing.

Those like me, who tire easi-
ly oi cliches, want “meaning-
rul dialogue,” Ind want some
specilic issues to he examined
critically. We want ii priority
assigned to those issues, one
that ippreciates Grinnell’s aca-
demic 1ailures, such as poor
teaching and crowded class-
rooms, as well as its social tail-
ures. We want innit disclu-
sions, not intellectual poln<
posity.

Whether our revolutionaries
“succeed” or not doesn‘t in.
terest me. Their goals do. Last
Week's “Open Letter" by the
"Group" was a helptul and posi-
tive act. Hopefully, we've dis-
pensed with cliches; now let’s
speak and act specilically and
intelligently, and perhaps with
a little hut. tr.

Meanwhile, 1 would like to
cordially invite Miss Cussler
up to my room (1032 East)
this Sunday atternoon. Per-
haps we could
plore the possih
“slap-happiness.”

Reply to Prof. Fletcher

To the Editor:

Protessor Fletcher’s letter in
last week’s 8&3 certainly
merits attention hy those who
signed the statement of two
weeks ago and the open letter
to President Leggett of last
week. The oarhcd levity at Mr.
Fletcher’s choice of quotation
leads me to suggest a selection
from the Marxist-inninlst canon
which may indicate that the
method of citation is as humor»
ous as it is endless. One quota-
tion which suggests itselt is
Lenin’s attack on Zinoviev and
Kamenev in October 1917 tor
their (ailure to support the
planned insurrection:

i . . to remain silent in the
race of such unheard of
strikebreaking would he a
crime. The more serious the
practical problem, and the
more responsihle and “promi.
nent” the persons guilty oi
strike-breaking, the more
dangerous it is, the more
resolutely must the strike-
breakers he ejected, and the
more unpnrdonahle would it
he to hesitate even in con-
sideration or the past “ser-
vices” of the rtrikshrenkers.
(Lenin, Selected Worlis, v.1!
part i, p. 191.)

Dr: The Proleetarian nevolu-
lion and the Renegade Kautsky.
Such citations are, or course,
amusing, and may satisfy une’s
penchant toi- pedantry, hut the
process of reasoning is very
reminiscent ol the scholastic
approach to Marxism

While such historical par-
allels are interesting it is un-
fortunate that prolessor Fletch-
er took the phrase “What is to
he done" out oi the context
which was given it in the sen-
iite speech. This sontrihutes to
a general misunderstanding of
the issues involved and may
lead to truitless polemic. Per-
haps it is unfortunate that the
speech ended with that phrase,
but the greater misfortune ii
that the phrase was used by
Mr. Fletcher is a pretext for
dialectical acrobatics, The
phrase was chosen to reﬂect
the sense or irustrstion which
many students feel, not to re-
call the content ot several
generations of Russian radical-
ism. After all, as Protessor
Fletcher linowi well, the
phrase "what is to he done
was used to express their
trustrition ind demand tor
change. Needless to say Lenin’s
adoption or that phrue did not

indicate his adoption of the
previous radicals programs.
The adoption oi that phrase
here does not commit those
who use it to “revolution” in
the sense that Lenin understood
the term.

Mr. Fletcher also describes
the group as “selfrstyled revo-
lutionnries.” This indicate.
clearly — even beyond tho
manner in which he rater-ted
— the depth of the gull be-
tween the content of the letter
and Mr. Fletcher's ipprecin.
tion of that content. For i! on.
sareiully peruse: that stateY
ment there is no mention of
the word "revolution," ratllel
I call [or student revolt. Till.
choice of phrasing was de-
liberate. None 0! the student:
in the group are calling toy
revolution: such a call would
be obvious nonsense. As a For
litical scientist Mr. Fletcher is
aware of the distinction be-
tween the metaphorical use oi
the word. eg. managerial revo-
lution, Negro revolution, etc.,
and the substantive, eg, Rus-
sian Revolution, French Revo-
lution, etc. There can he no
question of students taking
over the administration, hiring,
promoting, and firing laculty,
Such . goal would properly be
called revolution, and those
who proposed it under prevail.
lng conditions would be “in-
fantile adventurers.”

However. it one labels thosa
who call lor student revolt to
actualize ideals which are
stated in the Grinnell Colleg-
Catalog and are implicit in the
liberal tradition itself “revolu-
tional'ies," then one is indlttg<
ing in fantasy. The call for
student revolt is based upon the
failure of the college to achieve
adequate realization of these
ideals. As long as the adminis<
tuition is able to indulge in

ply with the laws and regu«

that. the actions of each mem-
bar at the campus community
retlect upon the College and
it is therefore the student's
responsibility to consider the
potential effect at his actions
not only upon himself but upon
the college community,

The other cases, heard Sun»
days, involved two stu-
dents, a Smith junior and a
Rawson lreshman, who were
observed to be sick in the
forum in separate incidents on
the evening or January 28. In ac-
cordance with the College rule,
their actions were brought to
the attention at the dean of
men. On being questioned, both
admitted that their behavior
and illness were the results of
excessive drinking The Deans'
Committee, in consultation with
the Executive Cabinet, refer-
red their cases to the Student
Primary Court. After hearing
the cases separately, the court
placed both studean on con-
duct probation tor a period be-
ginning immediately anti ex-
tending until spring vacation.

In reaching their decision on
the two cases, the court ad-
vised the students that “drunk-
enness does not absolve an in—
dividual from responsibility for
his actions, and that especially
in a public place, such behavior
at least inconveniences more
people than just the individual
himself.” The court further
felt that since both Students
were under 21 years of age,
their actions could be detri-
mental to the continued ei-
tectlveness of the current col-
lege drinking rule,

College Editors
Confer on

Generation Gap

Nearly 500 college editors
met in Washington last week-
end ior a conference on the
“Generation Gap." A Washing.
ton Post story told how the

students asserted their dissat-
istaction with society.

Presidential aide Walt Ros<
tow and columnist Walter Lipp<
man both spoke at the con-
ference. Rosww was hissed and
booed when he reprimanded the
students for presuming to speak
for their generation when oth-
ers of their age were tighting
“valiantly” in Vietnam. One
student answered, “What gen~
oration has ever been charac-
terized by its majority?"

other students talked of the
“sensitivity gap" (saying too
many older people are insen-
aitive), the “communications
gap," the “relevance gap"
(claiming much or academic
life is irrelevant). and the
knowledge cataclysm.

Bub Terrell of Morehouse
College summarized the reeling
of most at the editors when
he said that the generation
gap “arises out or disillu-
sionment with the adults who
have given up and traveled
the middle road despite its
ruts and the crap that rails
on them.”

Julia Van Camp from Dav.

cidated student sentiment as
follows:
“it just bothers me to go home
because I have to lie so much.

mother clips out all these art-

and sends them to me. My 13

from 1910 to 1916. In those six years he aided
the progress of the young ﬂying industry by his
spectacular but level-headed displays. Robinson
was not a typical stunt ﬂyer of the early era. l-le
constructed his own plane and engine, and his
flights helped spur interest in the serious aspects
of aviation,

Robinson left Grinnell at the age of 25 with
a circus company. The year was into. The circus
used an airplane that Robinson had built as I
Eublicity device. Robinson couldn't fly, although

is plane, powered by a so horsepower rotary our
gine, was air-worthy. Robinson learned to fly
irnm Max Lily in 1911 and until his return to
Grinnell he taught at Lily's ﬂying school in Chile
cago. Robinson made big news when he put out
a tire in his plane while being watched by hun~
dreds of Chicagoans in the streets below.

in 1913 Robinson returned to Grinnell. He had

lanned to continue on to Kansas City to estab-

sh an airplane factory there, but Grinnell busi-
nessmen persuaded him to stay in Grinneii,
where in 1914 he helped found the Grinnell Aerir
plane Company.

During its first months of existence the
company was threatened with infringement-
ni-petent action by the Wright Company, but
plans for a permanent factory continued.

Grinnell Company‘s First Plans

The company’s first monoplane, the Scout, was
built almost entirely by Robinson. The Scout, as
Grinneli resident Ross Coutts recalls, was I
“crate.” As such, it needed a light engine, which
Robinson provided by constructing a 400 pound,
100 horsepower, six—cylinder radial motor. By us-
ing magnalium for the crank case, Robinson
created the lightest engine known at that time.
The best 100 horsepower engine of that era was
made by Renault, and it weighed 683 pouiids.

Robinson had never seen an engine like the
one he built; he singlehandedly made the entire
nngine according to the basic plans for a radial
engine and came up with his own innovationaf
Only the magnaiium crank case had to be made
specially outside of Grinnell. '

The town of Grinnell remembers Robinson heal
for’hia record-breaking long-distance flight on

October 17, 1914. Robinson and his company
wanted to advertise their product so they decided
to try to break the American cross country roc-
ord oi 164 miles using Robinson’s monoplane.
To aid the promotional value of the attempt,
Robinson was granted permission by the United
States government to carry mail — only the acti-
ond man to be okayed for this service. Starting
from Des Moines, 50 miles west oi Grinnell,
Robinson was to fly to Chicago's Grant Park to
break the record. Sponsors for his flight were
the Chicago Tribune and the Des Moines Capital.

Record Flight to Chicago

On October 17, 1914, the sky over Iowa was
clear, and Robinson set off in the late morning
for his marathon run into Chicago. In Grinnell,
four clangs of the fire bell and the whistle at the
now defunct Spaulding Manufacturing Company
signalled Robinson’s departure from Des Moinea.
All business stopped as town residents rushed
into the streets and onto r0018 to see Robinson
fly over at a height of 5000 feet about 40 minute:
later.

Periodic reports on Robinson’s progress were
received in Grinneli until he was about; 30 miles
west of Chicago. At that point he entered a bank
of clouds. Officials at Grant Park feared that he
had crashed or had flown out over Lake Michigan
when he failed to land at the projected time. it
was several hours before they learned that Rob-
inson had landed safely in Kentland Indiana, 81
miles southeast of Chicago, after his 45 gallons
of fuel had been exhausted. by getting lost in the
clouds, Robinson had set a new American cross
country record of 362 mlles. The record was later
recognized by the Aero Club of America and war
not to be surpassed for over a year and a halt

The Tribune printed an interview with Rob-
inson after he finally flew into Chicago on
October 20. Robinson related, “The light was
so intense from the sunshine on the cloud:
that it affected my eyes like snow blindness."

In another story the Tribune reported:
“The monopiane which u Grinnell company
plans to manufacture, and which was Ill-
vented by Mr. Robinson, is known as tho
toto—visible type, by which the pilot is able
to see underneath the machine, the wings
being placed high. a radial motor is used, of
e peculiar construction not regularly manu-
fnctured at present.”

Robinson's ﬂight thoroughly convinced Grin-
nell that airplanes were here'to stay, Attempts
by several larger cities to litre the airplane com—
pany out of Grinncll were rebuffed when the town
residents bought out 525,000 of additional stock
offered by the company.

Robinson’s adventures and the progress of the
airplane company were dilly chronicled in the
Grinnell l-iernid.‘ The paper in 1914 reported that
the monoplane was 25 feet long with a wingspan
of 35 feet The engine was it radial air-cooled
type that ran at 1200 rpm. According to Robin
son, the plane and its power plant met all gov.

Imment specifications for a war plane. it carried
I dead weight of about 1000 pounds, It flew at 80
miles per hour and used a gallon of fuel every
eight miles. The plane had cost $3750, and the
company was hoping to sell the 400 pound en-
gine for $4000 — @700 less than Renault’a com-
parable engine.

The Herald announced that I reporter from
the Philadelphia Record was on hand for Rob-
inson’s ﬁrst test flight in July 1914. The town
was enthusiastic. In a news story, the Herald
Itatedi “He has built, almost singiehandedly,
In airship and an airship that will fly. it is a
great triumph for the Grinnell boy who
through his own efforts has worked his way
steadily upward in his chosen field, the navi-
gation of the air.”

Later in 1914, the Herald reprinted a letter
from a Grinnell resident who described his feel-
ings on his first ﬂight with Robinson.

“We hadn't been up but for a few minutes
when Robinson began tipping his machine up
sideways at about the angle of the line between
the two oughu in a percentage mark, and me on
the underside. i supposed there was something he
wanted to dump out, . . . He had me holding an
instrument he called a bamgraph. That’s a thing
that tells how far away the green grass is. it only
registers 5000 feet and the blame thing went its
limit and quit on the first lap. .. . . Finally we
overlook the earth and when I got my feet
clamped on terra firma and enough oil out of my
eyes so 1 could look around, darned if we weren’t
right where we started."

Test Files Navy Equipment

Robinson returned safely to Grinnell in No-
vember from California, where he had tested I
ntabilizer for naval officers. Civilians were re-
quested to test fly this stabilizer before govem-
merit test pilots would be risked.

Plans to make a “convertible" plane that
would consist of a monoplane with an extra set of
wings were announced in December. Hopefully,
the plane would meet government requirements
for both a monoplane and biplane.

As 1914 came to an end, the Herald reminded
Grinnell that the Curtiss Company was doing a
huge business in a town about the size of Grinnoll.
Surely Grinneli could keep pace especially with
the lightest airplane engine known.

In January 1915, Robinson was invited to
New York to be one of nine men awarded I
medal of merit at the convention of tho Aem
Club of America. The medal was given in
recognition of Robuison’l Des Moines-ttrfndb

not one word about the Grinnell Aeroplane Com-
pany appeared in the Herald. It is known that in
August 1918, an exact duplicate of Robinson’s
engine -— manufactured by the Dodge Tool Com-
pany of Grinnell — was block tested at Dayton,
Ohio, for the Aircraft Division of the United
States Ordnance Department. A note attached to
that engine, which is now owned by Grinnell Col-
lege, sadly reports that “the Armistice was
signed before any decision was made concerning
air-cooled engines." Lacking Robinson’s spirit and
skill and unable to compete with the Curtisses
and Wrights, the Grinneli Aeroplane Company
faded from existence.

Grinnell has never iorgotten Billy Robinson.
In 1930, llle Herald ublished a letter from an
aviator who noted: t just struck me that the
late Wm. Robinson had more claim to fame than
most early birds After the two Wright brothers
and Glen Curtiss had by flight demonstrated
their respective models, endless copies were
made by people who made a living at country
meets until they were killed, as happened in

most cases, or till there was no money in the
game. However, while the planes were home-
made Contraptions, the power plant was invari-
ably bought from sonic manufacturer. Wm. Rob-
inson is the only other instance, beside the three
earliest birds, who made himself also the engine
that powered the plane. Sure line company to
have been in.”

The same year, Herald editor w. G. Ray
wrote of Robinson, “indeed next to his me-
chanical genius, the enthusiasm for his pro-
fession combined with unlimited courage was
the most prominent trait of his character.”
Two friends of Robinson still live in Grinneli.

Ml‘. Carl Child and Mr; Ross Colitis both remem-
ber Robinson as a mechanical genius.

Mr. Couits continues, “But he didn’t know
anything about business. if he had a dollar he
spent it on a gadget for his plane." .

"He was headstrong and hard to handle. i
remember when he finished his monoplane in
1914, he brought it downtown to have it weighed
on my scales. Why, he wouldn't let anyone touch
the plane except himself."

aeinre his death, Robinson had applied for
patents on his revolutionary light motor. These
patents were apparently never granted. It has
never been determined what happened to Rob-
inson’s plans and drawings, but an article in the
Herald in i918 pointed olit that the engine that
carried Charles Lindbergh across the Atlantic in
1E27 was mighty similar to the one lhat ilew Billy
Robinson to indiana 13 years earlier,

situation: the possible basis for negotiations; the
international context; the Ky government and the
constitutional convention; military escalation and
bombings; and our ultimate objectives and in
tentions in Vietnam. In each case the Secretary’s
remarks did not differ significantly from the po—
sitions he has taken publicly on numerous occa-
Sions.
—— Geneva —

The secretary reiterated his pledge to “go to
Geneva tomorrow" if someone will be there to
talk peace with him and restated the “fourteen
points" (Dept. of State Bulletin, Jan. 24, 1966, p.
116) as the basis for any negotiated settlement.
He pointed to several recent alterations in the
Vietnam situation which he felt were encourag-
ing. These included the military and political
progress of the joint American-South Vietnamese
effort; the persistent interest of the Soviet Union
in favor of a prompt and peaceful resolution of
the Conﬂict; and the internal unrest in China
which may give Hanoi a freer hand with which to
negotiate.

In response to a comment by one of the stu-
dents that military dictators are seldom willing to
step down for a democraticallyrelected govern-
ment, the Secretary said, with a smile, that it
would be all the greater credit to Premier Ky
when he did.

— Continuation —

The Secretary confirmed what he has said re-
peatedly in public that the United States has no
desire to escalate the war effort and does so only
in response to increased aggression from the
North. The bombings were justified as a neces<
sary incentive to bring Hanoi to the conference
table.

The Secretary indicated that the US. has no
ulterior motives for being in South Vietnam. WI
are honoring a commitment, according to Mr.
Rush, and seek nothing other than the right of
selfoetermination for the South Vietnamese. He
feels failure to honor our commitment in Viet-
nam would undermine the worth of our word
throughout the world.

Rusk urged that further thought be given by
us to the concessions we would expect Hanoi to
make at the bargaining table and to the basin
question which he felt had receded too far into
the background, “How do you organize a durable
peace?”

The atmosphere was cordial, with a slightly
academic flavor as befitted a group of students
and an exrprofessor. The Secretary was most rec
ceptive to our opinions and was honest in his an-
awers to our questions

-—- Doubts Remained —-

Despite his candor and obvious sincerity, the
Secretary failed to alleviate the doubts of those
present. As our chosen spokesman, Bob Powell
of North Carolina, said in a press conference that
followed the Rusk meeting, “We had hoped that
Mr. Rusk would help us resolve our anxieties.
After our meeting with him, we regret to report
that he only confounded many of our misgivings
and generated many others.”

The general impression of the group was that
the United States is "clearly pursuing a military
solution" to the Vietnam problem and that, whiio
our leaders are sincere in their efforts to seek a
negotiated settlement, they are unwilling to make
the compromises necessary for that to be a real
possibility. In representing the opinion of the
group, Bob Powell articulated our fears that the
us. was unrealistically insisting on a “complete
surrender of the goals and ambitions of the other
side as opposed to a partial accommodation of
those interests“ at rid called the Secretary’l
“middle course” nothing more than a slow and
inevitable military escalation.

I think that the participants came out of the
discussion thinking pretty much the same as
when they went in. Those who previously had
been outraged at the Government’s policies con~
tlnued in their vehement protestations Those who
had been perplexed, as I had been, about the
course of action in Vietnam remained so. All
were concerned about Mr. Rusk‘s basic question,
“How do you organize a durable peace in the
world?” and somewhat distraught to find that
he and the Government seem no closer to an
answer than we are.

Comment On
Student Revolt

Iowa Governor Harold
Hughes and University of Iowa
President Howard Bowen were
quoted by the February 5 Du
Molnes Sunday Register in
supporting dissident American
youth in their revolt against
older generations.

Said Hughes in a speech at
Des Moines: “I believe that
young people feel that they have
been deceived and cheated by
having been fed a saccharin
folklore that doesn’t square with
the realities of a world that iii
tarnished by war, bigotry, pov-
erty, violence, materialism and
broken pledges.

“We have failed to tell them
the truth,” continued the gov—
ernor, “that there are no so-
lutlons, only the seeking or
tllem, and that this is what
iifeisabout." .

Speaking at the 0 rs mid-'
year commencement ceremoib
ies Saturday, Bowen, who is a
former Grinnell president, said.
“We need peace, racial har-
mony, a spiritual life and in-
dividuality. We need them
more than we need comfortable
suburban living, or a trillion~
dollar gross national product."
Bowen urged graduates to
"hold on to your discontents"
so that they may enact changel
when they move into position.

An Interview With Nadas

The Artist in Person

pus last week, Nadas talked
freely about his mission as an
artist and teacher.

Teaching, says the well-
imuwn pianist, is more than
simply giving piano lessons. “1
am interested in my students
as human beings, not just as
mobile lBM cards, .Every
teacher is a counselor. You
can‘t detach yourself In cold
blood from the very essence
or your students, who are hu-
man beings needing guidance.
That doesn’t mean that you
have to become deeply involv-
ed in the students’ problems,
but you have to do more than
simply ignore them."

Teaching, he continued, must
be a contact between human
personalities, since the devela
opment or artist and human
being must go hand in hand.

—Concert Performance—

Being a concert pcriormer,
to him, is a way of life to
which one is called, rather
than a profession which is
chosen. “Being an artist de-
mands a great deal of intro-
spection, humility, and dedica-
tion to your art. That leaves
no time to feel proud, con<
ceited, or superior to your fel-
low man...

“I’m only the wire that trans-
mits the message. People are
not interested in whether the
wire is made of copper or
zinc or aluminum or iron.
They’re interested in what the
message is. In interpreting a
masterpiece. the artist must
search thoroughly and humbly
and honestly to see what the
composer wants."

—-Formal Training—
Nadds began his rormal

piano training at the age ol
ten in Budapest, Hungary. In

three years he was ready for
the government-operated acad-
emy. The work there was rig<
omus, and the competition was
fierce. In tour years, piano
students were expected to learn
all 32 or Beethoven’s piano
sonalas, Bach's complete key-
hoard works, and 16 piano con-
certi—all memorized

To enter the academy at
such an early age, Nadas had
to get special permission from
the Minister of Public Educa-
tion to complete hls high school
education by means of private
tutor; one oi the conditions was
that he had to finish in the
upper lo per cent or his class.
High school tor a Hungarian
youngster included trigonomet-
ry. chemistry, physics, inte-
gral and diilerential calculus,
eight years or Latin, eight
years or German, and four
years of either French, Italian
or English. Nadas chose Eng-
lish. Every year, a state exam
was required, which consisted
of two days of written examr
inatlons and two days of orals.

At the same time, while lie
was spending his days at the
academy and his evenings with
his tutor, he studied piano with
Bartok.

Alter his graduation from the
academy, Nadas was captured
by the gestapo and spent three
years in a concentration camp
in Austria. He was one of 140
to survive out of 28,000.

—Transilion—-

After World War ll he went
to Italy and 1mm there to
South America, He was first
head of a piano master class
in Caracas, Venezuela. and
later director of one of the
national conservatories. in 1952
he was invited by Loyola Uni-
versity, in New Orleans, to be
artist in residence and head
or the piano department, He
has spent the past seven years
at San Francisco State College.

In addition to private piano
lessons, Nadas teaches a course
in piano literature and gives
many lectures on various com-
posers at San Francisco State
and elsewhere. He believes in
spontaneity as opposed to the
“Cerebrullsm” of a lecture
planned to the Smallest details.

People, says Nadas, are the

Team Loses to U of Chicago

By Barry Ancona

The Gtinnell basketball team
braved icy roads and six
hches of snow to play the
Maroon: of the University of
Chicago last Saturday. The
Irowd of close to three hundred
theering Chicago fans did not
Intimidate the handful of Grin-
nell footers, but the 70-511 de-
feat did.

In the first half, the Pioneers
hit 42 per cent from the field,
but this percentage was off-
set by a 27 per cent free throw
mark and numerous instances
of traveling and throwing the
ball away.

The first few minutes of the
second half saw Grinnell's
'downfall as Chicago shot un-
erringly from close in and out-
side to run up a twenty point
lead. The Pioneer bench took
I turn on the boards and fin-
ished the game.

Elliott Hibbs and Mike
Schwartz, third and fourth in
Midwest Conference scoring,
managed only 5 and 9 points
respectively. Roger Able was
high scorer with 10. Others
scoring: Tom Hill and Tom
Lower, 1 each; Bob Watt and
Thor Evanson, 4 each; Steve
Brintnall and Jim Stephens, 2
each.

The alumni present at the
game seemed understanding
about Grlnnell’o twenty-first
consecutive loss, and one re-
marked to Coach Pfitsch, “You
can't win them all," Replied
the Coach, “You mean we can’t
win any.”

The cagers travel to Mt,
Vernon tomorrow to take on
the second place Cornell team
that handed them their twen-
tieth defeat, 70-69, on January
24 in Darby Gym. Their next
home game is Feb. 21 against
Monmouth.
