Bowen Revisits Game of Numbers.
Offers Modified Tutorial System

. By Susan Taylor

“To free students "no learn
how to learn by themselves” is
the end of a liberal arts educa-
tion, according to Dr. Howard
fl. Bowen, President of the Col-
ege

Addressing the collage CDm<
munity for the last time before
his resignation takes effect
July 1, Bowen saw no need to
dwell on the past. ”I would like
to look ahead," he said, “to try
but some’ideas about the way
education might be conducted
at Grinnell in the future."

Making reference to his 1962
Convocation Address, “A Game
of Numbers,” Bowen said that
his present comments were a
modification of the views ex-
pressed in that speech, and
that they might be entitled “A
Game of Numbers Revisited."
He said that the modification
of his former plan resulted from
his recent tour of European
universities. He felt that
the European system had de-
cided disadvantages, but that
yaluable lessons could, still be
learned from it — particularly
from the tutorial system of
Oxford and Cambridge.

Bowen defined a Grinnell stu-
dent's aims as “progress to
ward broad liberal learning
and and progress toward a ma»
jor field." He felt that these
goals could he better met by
a modified tutorial system
which might be adopted by the
college.

Under the system outlined by
the president each professor
would teach two courses in
stead of the present three and
consequently e a c h student
would take only three courses
a semester instead of four.

“In my opinion the college
is still offering too many
courses,” Bowen stated. When
we have new educational ideas
we tend to add them to what we
have without dropping any-
thing. By weeding out courses,
Bowen hopes to free time for
independent study and tutorial
activities.

,Under the proposed modified
tutorial system he foresaw so-
lutions to some of the problems
of faculty-student relations
and the advising system. Each
student would have both an un-
derclass tutor and a major tu-
tor. Each faculty tutor would
have 300 hours a semester once
taken up by teaching a third
course free for tutorial acti

Seniors Reminded:
Reserve Rooms Now

Seniors are again reminded
that they may reserve campus
housing for their Commence-
ment guests at the Alumni of-
fice beginning at 1:00 pm. on
Monday, May 18. Office hours
will continue throughout the
week from 1:00 to 5:00 p.m.
during which time seniors may
secure reservations. Each sens
for will be allowed space for
three guests and will pay for
their reservations when they
are made. Miss Jones, the
Alumni Secretary, urgently re-
quests that seniors do not delay
in making housing arrange-
ments for their guests.

 

ties, As an underClass tutor, the
professor would guide his ad-
visees in preparation for their
liberal arts comprehensive ex-
amination. The major tutors
would hold work closely with
junior and senior majors, hold
seminars, and guide the majors
in the preparation of a senior
thesis and in study for senior
major comprehensives. Regular
meeting with advisees would be
the rule.

Bowen also stated that the
students should be free to take
the liberal arts exam when
they are ready. “In a sound
exam there must be allowanCS
for individuality.” or the pres-
ent JLAE he said, “We have
made good progress in an un<
charted field," but; there is still
much work to be done.

Revision of the grading sys-
tem for course work was an-
other feature. Replacement of
A and B with High Pass, C—Plus
and C with Pass, and D and F
with Failure would eliminate
the intense competition for
grade and allow the student
to do more independent work.
However, the rigorous letter
grades would be maintained for
required independent study and
comprehensive exams, This in-
dependent Work and compre<
hensive exam program would
be Weighted as oneefourth of
the student’s entire perform-
ance.

Although this system would
mean .many advantages for
students, Bowen said, there
would also be problems. The
number of courses offered by
the college would decrease,
“The range of elective free-
dom,’ Bowen countered, would
be expanded. However, he
added, “i see no way of pro‘
viding freedom with the op-
portunity to make mistakes.”
Those unable to funCLion under
the system would not qualify
for a Grinnell degree.

Those awarded degrees in
such a system. he said, would
be better prepared for graduv
ate school, for life, and for
lifetime education.

Spring Day, 1944- '64 Reviewed,-
Truditions, Innovations Highlight

By Cynthia Brust

“Do you really think it will
be. . . .?" ”I heard it was going
to be on. . . ." “It has to be
Wednesday. I have an hourly
then!" Each year, as the mon-
soons end and the Grinnell cam-
pus changes from brown to
green, the question arises
again. Everyone, students and
professors alike, wants to know.
Spring Day becomes conversa-
tion topic No. l. Generations of
Grinnell students have waited
tensely for their specific form
of Spring Day, just. as we have
the last three weeks.

Twenty years ago, Spring
Day “finally sprung just about
5 minutes before everyone was
ready to give up.” Spring Day
during this period was unan-
nounced at'about 8:30 in the
morning. The rest of the morn-
ing was spent doing assigned
campus improvement projects,
followed by a picnic, games
and a program in the after-
The event in 1944 was very
much girl-dominated, for this
was the “New Grinnell” of
the war years. The few men
remaining, however, managed
to turn the mud fight (one of
many now-defunct traditions of
the day) into an ail~out brawl.
The 5&3 reporter, not Without

 

pride, declares that “For the
first time in the history of Grin»
nell Spring Days, everybody
was thrown into the mud pit.”

Spring Day, 1948, was held in
the mud and rain that only a
Grinnell spring can produce.
The day included the traditional
projects, tug-of-war, egg-throw-
ing contest and picnic. By now,
Spring Day was also the time
of the initiation of the new
members of Grinnell Players.
Their rites, which consisted
mainly of impromptu satiric
skits, took place in Merrill
Park. 1948 also saw the first
softball game, pitting faculty
men against the Coil-1P and Stu-
dent Councii members, _

May 14, 1949, saw a wild
Spring Day, dominated by the
contests and races of the many
married couples who attended
Grinnell in the post-war years.
Pie-eating contests and wheel-
barrow races were highlighted,
as was a beard contest. Tugro
wars and softball games were
also part of the day, which
ended with a dance on Cowles
Hall roof.

The afternoon storm of May
5, 1952, didn't hinder either
Spring Day or the sunburns that
it always brings, A ferris wheel

Senate Shows Concern Over loss
0f Profs. Courses for Next Year

By Wade Stevenson

The student Senate passed a
resolution Wednesday night ex~
pressing the concern of many
students “over the apparent
lack of funds for the hiring of
professors for next. year."

The resolution, which was
directed to the Trustees and
Administration, stated in part
that: HBecause we as students
feel that our primary purpose
in attending Grinnell is to re-
ceive an excellent education.
and because the tuition rate is
rising each year, we wish to ex-
press to you our desire that
the quality and quantity of fac-
ulty members be maintained
and increased, even though this
will perhaps mean using some-
what less elegant physiCal fa-
cilities."

A letter from Marilyn Alt, the
sponsor of the resolution, Was
read to the Senate. Miss Alt
noted that “I ran a compara~
tive study of faculty size and
course offerings this year with
those for next. year. At this
point there is a net loss of ten
faculty members—this includes
those who are on leave, and I

 

am told that some of the posi-
tions are still trying to be filled.
There is also a net loss of six-
teen courses fcr the next year."

Many senators gave the dis-

continuation of funds from the
Ford Foundation as a reason
for the difficult financial situa-
tion of the College; however,
John Black said he “under-
stood that money from the
Ford Foundation went into
building programs and not into
the operating expenses of the
College."

Black moved to place the fol-
lowing amendment at the end
of the resolution: “We would
request an expla ation from
the College Administration as
to why, in view of the tuition
increase, the College finds its
finances severely limited.” The
amendment was passed.

In other business, Anne
Campbell, chairman of the Ju-
diciary Committee, indicated
that the committee had found
new flaws in the student court
system. Nevertheless, Miss

traction, and a movie and
d a n c a on central campus
brought festivities nearer the
form we know.

Early in the second semster
of 1954, an sea editorial urged
a re-examination of the Spring
Day program. The evening and
day period we celebrate, a day-
and-next-mornlng plan, the pos«
sibilities of extended hours,
and the controversy between I
surprise element and a more
formally-executed holiday were
considered. In spite of these
proposed changes, Spring Day
1954 was a very traditional al-
fair.

Many of this year’s Seniors,
including Jack Chapman-
whose Senate began with I
bang—have vivid memories of
their first Spring Day, As the
student body stormed the usual
Wednesday-night Senate meet-
ing, all regular business was
suspended in order to discus:
Spring Day. Chapman’s origi-
nal motion, to suspend the al-
lotment of the Spring Day com-
mittee unless the affair wal
held Thursday, was withdrawn.
lts replacement, that Spring
Day be Thursday “if at all poa~
sible,” was passed over the ob-
jections of the committee, De-
spite the impromptu nature of
the celebration, it was editor-
ially lauded as the “best Spring
Day in three or four years.
Features were a showing of
Pal Joey, picnics, a variety
show, and a greased pig race,

Bermuda shorts and umbrel-
las combined on central cam-
pus this year to start the
Spring Day festivities for 1964.
The announcement was mad.
at 4:00 by the traditional caril-
lon performance and the inno-
vation of a black convertible
carrying three girls across the
campus. (You didn't leave any
nasty tracks, I hope!) The sun
insisted on beating down about
ten minutes out of every hour,
just enough so that everyone
thought MAYBE there would
be a sunny Spring Day, after
all. However, Tuesday morning
was as dark and wet as any
yet this spring, and Grinnell
students retired to Darby for a
"gym-dandy” picnic and pro-
gram. Taiiangers, Scarleteers,
folk dancers, the West Guys.
and BrookslHicks-Cohon and
company made a valiant effort
to replace Lake Acre and sun-
bathing, but somehow this
week hasn’t seemed right with-
out everyone’s red faces and
tender shoulder blades. It's too
bad the Spring Day Committee
couldn’t have set aside an al-
lotment for bribing the weath-
erman, to insure the complete
success of their \vellrplarined
holiday.

Transcript Trouble

Last June, the Board

scholarship repayment rule because of student
sure in the form of a referendum which calle

of Trustees abolished the
YES-
for

repeal of the clause by a vote of 644-77. The reason
for rescinding the rule, given both by the students and
by the Board, was that such regulation was not in
keeping with the philosophy of a liberal arts college.

There is another un-liberal-arts like rule that ought
to be brought to students’ attention and which ought
to be rapeaied by the Board of Trustees. This regula-
tion states that any student who sends a transcript
to another college immediately loses eligibility for a
room the following year, regardless of the fact that
he or she has paid the $50 room-reservation fee.

In explaining the reason behind this rule, one ad-
ministration member noted that il: makes it easier for
the college to assure rooms to students who are sure
of returning. While this might be the case, it is still
a fact that the student has paid $50 to guarantee a
room and that this $50 will be lost if the student finally

does decide to transfer.

This $50 should be sufficient payment to the col-
lege in cases where a student really is not sure of re-

turning in the fall. Why

compound his worries by

cutting him off from this college before he is accepted

at another school?

The college has every right to want to keep its
first-rate student body, but it should use positive

means of doing so.

Of course, it goes without
saying that there will be a
few ”minor problems” and
*"little difficulties” [0 be taken
care of after’ a nuclear holo-
caust. » One of these “minor
problems" concerns itself with
the question of what we are
going Do do about our jobs
after a nuclear cataclysm.

The United States Govern»
silent, in its inimitable way, has
come up with the answer to
this question. Most of the gov-
ernmental branches have sent,
in recent months, memoran-
dums to all personnel concern-
ing what is expected of them
regarding their job obligations
after a thermonuclear war.
Illustrative of these memoran-
dums is the following directive
from Madeleine O’Brien, ad-
ministrative officer of the U. 5.
Commission on Civil Rights:

“All employees, if prevented
from reporting to their regular
place of duty because of enemy
action, are requested to go to
the nearest Post Office and ask
for a federal employee registreu
tlon card. Fill out all spaces on
the card and return it to the
Post Office clerk. The employ»
lug agency in the registration

 

card should be shown as Gen-
eral Services Administration,
with the branch as the U. S.
Commission on Civil Rights in-
asmuch as our official records
are maintained by GSA. The
Post Office will forward your
card to the Civil Service Com-
mission. When the Civil Serv-
ice Commission- receives your
card, they will notify the Gen-
eral Services Administration.
They can then decide where
and when you should report for
duty. This should be done as
soon as possible after an attack
to enable you to be kept on the
roster of active employees and
to have your pay forwarded to
you. If you change your ad-
dress after the card has been
sent, get a new one in the same
manner prescribed above. Ali
though you complete your reg-
istration promptly, there may
be some delay before you re-
ceive your work instruc-
tions. . .”

I am indebted to Jack A.

which is, incidentally, an excel»
lent and highly informative

this beautiful example of “Red

Letters to the Editor

Corrects Herzog Statement:
Clarifies Position on Nominees

To the Editori

Since I was substantially mis-
quoted by Mr. Herzog in the
Senate article which appeared
in last week’s 5&3, I feel that I
must endeavor to set the rec-
ord straight. Referring to the
High Court nominees of Pete
Klein, Nonie Goldman, Vince
Anku and Bill Zwink, I was
quoted as stating, “there could
have been better people."

Essentially this was not my
opinion then or now. A minor‘
lty of the Nominations Commit-

tee abstained from voting on
one nominee but it should be
emphasized that not one vote
was cast against any of these
people. The statement printed
by Mr. Herzog was a minority
opinion representing neither my
views nor those of the majority
of my committee.

If Mr. Herzog wishes to quote
such a statement, I feel he
should endeavor to place it in
the proper context. Slipshod
methods of reporting the news
benefit no one.

lfurasch's Critique,

Defends Movies Program at Grinnell

To the Editori

Grinnellians, pity Don Kur»
asc‘h—his main hope has not
been realized In his recent let-
ter to the editor (May 8), he
introduces his brilliant com-
mentary on the pizza purchase
by the following statement:
“My main hope in this letter

is that my anger after reading
the article in last week’s 5&3

(regarding the budget passed
by the SGA) does not cause me
to go astray and obliterate the
point I plan to make." I’m
afraid his anger has lost him
in areas far distant to the piz-
za purchase. I wish to com-
ment on only one of Kurasch’s
profound but unrelated pro-
nouncements.

Kurasch severely criticizes the
movies program by stating that
students “have often and right.
iy complained about the quality
of die movies brought here."
He characterizes the typical
film shown as being a “Grade
C piece of film trash." 1 ques-
tion the quality of Kurasch’s
knowledge. As a point of mu,
Hollywood's ranking system
does not extend beyond the B
level. Therefore, it is impos
sible to show a Grade C pic-
ture. Furthermore, if one

checks the published spring
film calendar, one can hardly
generalize these works as “film
trash."

As the new movies chairman
for 1964~65, I am receptive to
knowledgeable and intelligent
criticism. Kurasch’s statements
are neither. His personal “an»
ger" has led him astray in this
area too. Because his anger is
so overpowering, 1 seriously
question Kurasch’s qualifica-
tions for spokesman of total
campus opinion. Perhaps Kur-
asch has verbally complained
in the past about the movies
program. If so, I would appreci—
ate any thoughts he has con-

cerning it, but not absurdities

Campbell suggested that the
student body does not unden-
stand the functions of the courts
and this hinders effective coun
action. The Senate voted to
send a directive to the Execu-
tive Cabinet asking that a com-
plete list of the combined rights
and obligations of the defend-
ant be placed in the next Stun
dent Handbook.

The question of disaffiliation
from the United States Nation-
al Student Association was
postponed until the next Senate
meeting. Phil Johnson, 5. G. A.
President, could not attend the
meeting and, in a letter to the
Senate, asked that the discus.
sion of N. S. A. be delayed for
a week.

There was some dissent over
the matter of once again de-
laying action on N. S. A. John
Black felt that the call for de-
lay was a “tactic to put off de-
bate until a time when the
Senate would not have a nude
rum." Richard Heilbron stated
that "we should not delay this
particular business any long-
er.” The Senate, heeding John-
son’s plea, decided for delay.

The appointment of Carol
Yenawlne as secretary to the
Executive Cabinet was ap-
proved. in reaction to the criti-
cism leveled on the Senate for
its pizza resolution, the body
refused to approve the remain-
ing $20.49 from the judicial re-
serve of the school year 1963-
64 for the purpose of a party
for the members of the Men’l
Primary Court then serving.

~Thinclads lake First at Elmhurst:
To Defend Conference Title at Coe

After running away with the
Elmhurst Relays title last Sat-
urday, the Pioneer Track squad
has its eye on the Midwest
Conference outdoor title for
the third year in a row.

Winning five events and set~
ting a new school record and a
new meet mark in the relays,
Coach Dick Young‘s thinclads
accumulated 55 points. Hills-
dale College was second with
211/2.

Jeri Langham was a Pio-
neer double winner, capping
the BSO-yard run in 1:581 and
the mile run In 4:“.1. Bruce
Beckord broke his own Grin-
neil record by breaking the
tape in the 440-yard run in
148.4.

Ron Schachel and John Te-
Paske joined Langham and
Beckord in the 1-mile relay.
The quartet set a new meet
record with a 3:215 time.

Rounding out the list of win-
ners was Tom Wood, who
topped the field in the javelin
with o. throw of 191-10.

Now Grinnell must defend its
outdoor title this weekend in
Cedar Rapids. Coach Young
ﬁgures it to be a tough go, the

Berg Named Recipient
0f Theophilus Trophy

Fred Berg, a senior, has been
named the David Theophilus
Trophy winner as the outstand-
ing athlete at Grinnell College
The award was given Berg at
the annual Honor 6 letter-
mnn’s club banquet held last
Tuesday evening. In honor of
Theophilus, a 1951 graduate of
Grinneli who was killed in Ko-
rea. The award is based upon
performance, leadership, and
scholastic records.

A sprinter in track at Grin-
nell, Berg was captain and
elected the most valuable
member of the track team last
spring. Because of an eligibil-
ity technicality, stemming from
his transferring to Grinnell af-
ter one semester at the Illinois
Institute of Technology, he was
not eligible for competition this
year.

Others receiving wards at the
banquet, at which President
Howard R. Bowen, spoke, were
the “most valuable” and “most
improved’ of the fall and winter
sports teams.

Those honored included Steve
Warrick and Elston Bowers,
who received the Dick Ullrich
trophies es the most valuable
lineman and back, respectively,
on the football team; Rod
Brown, in cross country; Dave
Scott, in soccer; John Sundell,
in basketball; Larry Miller, in
wrestling; and John Kraai, as
the most improved swimmer.

Soot Split Follows
Knox 14-0 Shuioui

By Jack Hartod

Coach John Pfitsch’s dia-
mondmen take a break this
weekend as regular Midwest
Conference action makes way
for the 1964 league playoffs to
be held Friday and Saturday at
Carleton, The Carls, the only
unbeaten squad in the MCAC,
will play host to Knox, the
,Southern Division representa-
tive, in the best—of—three se-
ries

Knox captured the divisional
pennant last Friday as the Si-
wash rolled to a 14-0 decision
over Grinnell. Steve Tilly, who
took the loss, was retired in
the sixth after being touched
for nine runs in the two pre
ous frames and Cal Collier fin-
ished up for Grinnell.

On Saturday, the Pioneers
salvaged a split in a twinbill at
Monmouth thanks to the fine
pitching of Barry Anderson.

The Scots won the opener,
but in the nightcap the Pfitsch-
men turned in one of their best
performances of the year to
shut out the Scots and take a
44] decision. Anderson held
Monmouth to three hits in go-
ing the route and striking out
ten.

The latest MCAC standings
show Grinnell dropped to fourth
and holding a half-game lead
over Monmouth. The Pioneers
are 451. Cornell, which Won two
last weekend, moved into third
with a 475 record. The Rams

Golfers Aim for Top;
1963 Ghampinns Knox

“Let's finish first for a
change,” is the chant of the
Grinnell College golf team this
week as it prepares for Friday
and Saturday‘s Midwest Con-
ference Meet in Cedar Rapids.

Early in the season, Grinnell
tipped the Siwash, to halfway
avenge its second place stand-
ing last year, but it was a close
meet all the way. Last year,
Knox was three strokes better
than the Pioneers,

Leading Coach Larry Craw-
ford’s entries will be Dave Sel-
lergren, the medalist last year,
who has apparently found his
game again after a mid-season
‘slump.

His main challenger for the
individual honor could be team-
mate Ted Risser, a hard-hitting
sophomore, who wrestled the
No, 1 spot away from Seller-
gren and has been reluctant to
give it back. .

Also returning 'i'rom last
year’s team are Eric Miller.
Who was fourth in the individ-
ual standings, and Russ Har<
den, who copped sixth last year.

Out of his first league meet
is Mike Miller who has been
coming on strong of late and
could push the four above him
to better rounds.

 

Racqueleers Win 3;
MCAC Meet Next

With three straight dual wins
to close the regular season,
Grinnell College’s tennis team
Will be making I} bid this week-
end oo hang onto a first division
spot at the Midwest Confer-
enca Meet in Cedar Rapids,

Shannon, who was unde~
heated in dual meets last year
at No. 3, had troubles getting
Started this season when he
moved up two notches. How-
ever, he has won his last four
matches, coming from behind
in two of them

Also coming back strong has
been Mike Greenfield, Bowers'
No. 3 man Greenfield. just a
sophomore, has won his last
five tries, in addition to team-
ing with Ken Clymer to win
three doubles matches in a row.

Clymer, the No. 2 man, has
also been making a comeback
and could surprise a few again
this year. Last year, unnoticed
before the conference meet, he
fought his way to the semi-fi-
nals before falling to the even-
tual No. 4 champion.

Playing in the No, 4 spot this
year, and teaming with Shan-
non to form the top doubles
outfit, is Bob Koxnfeld (Chica-
go, Ill.). He has won two of his
last three matches.

Summer Storage?

in the post, we have stored furniture and other items for you over the
summer months as a courtesy service. Because of the addition of more
nationally predominant lines, such as the A. B. Dick Products Co., in the
duplicating field, and because of expansion of off-set priniing facilities,
and other inventory increases, we no longer have the space Io oc-
commodote storage for you.

We will be able to accept typewriters only for storage. May we suggest
you have your typewriters rte-conditioned over the summer and be al-
ready to go next fall for o school year of hard usage?

Our service is guaranteed. Your patronage is always appreciated.
