Haas Defines Role as All Encompassing

By ANN KIRSCHNER

Chaplain Dennis l-Iaas sees
his role at Grinnell primarily
in terms of a “ministry to the
college community." He defines
such a ministry as “availability
and readiness to assist in all
areas of student life.”

The three major areas in
which Mr. Haas will be involved
are religious activities, teach-
ing, and counseling. In all these
areas, and' especially the latter,
Mr. Haas will acquaint himself
with the needs of the Students in
order to better plan programs
and not effectively on campus.
He is looking forward to creat-
ing new programs to supple-
ment the ones now in operation.
While he hopes to maintain
many of the present programs,
such as those carried on by the
Board of Religion, he would like

to see if student interest suffi-
ciently justiﬁes their existence.
Mr. Haas hopes to become ac-
quainted with the needs of the
Catholic and Jewish students on
campus. He feels that ideally
there should be a priest and a
rabbi more available to work
out personal problems that he
might not be able to handle.
In answer to a question about
the religious activities on cam-
pus being Protestantroriented,
Mr. Haas replied that lt had
been suggested to him to make
chapel services more universal.
He feels, however, that a serv-

ice general enough to make no
religious distinctions, but that
would be rather a prayer ses-
sion, would be so watered down
as to be of no use to anyone.
He would like to see non-Protes-
tant programs if student inter-
est warrants them. In particu-
lar, there is a possibility of
holding occasional Jewish Sah-
bath services in the chapel,

graduate, He earned his so.

'Aufonomy for Councils':
New North Campus Adviser

In an effort to improve the North Campus society, academically
and socially, two new resident advisers have been added to the
men's hall structure. They join Terry Moore and Gene Kowert who
are beginning their second year as advisers.

Dave Johnson, adviser for North and South Younker and Smith,

in addition will work as an as-
Slstant in the history depart-
ment. Johnson is currently
studying for his PhD. in history
at the University of Minnesota
and has taken a year off for
reading.

Although it is still quite early
in the academic year, Johnson
already has some thoughts about
the resident advisrr program
and Grinnell society. He felt
that the motive behind the resin
dential advisor system has not
been “clearly articulated by the
admlnistration” thus bringing
about a certain amount of dis-
trust for the advisor among the
students. As far as disciplinary
action Johnson said the Dorm
Councils should have complete
autonomy in this area but that
he might aid in the enloroe-
ment of quiet hours.

“I expected a closed society
at Griiinell, and I was not dis-
appointed," Johnson continued.
“Upperclassmen have the notion
that Grinnell is the centersofa
the~universe and does not need
improvement." He cited the
fact that some of the classes
at Grinnell are as large as lini-
versity classes and emphasized
the selfrconsciousness of stu»
dents towards their college as
unique.

Paul Thurston, advisor for
Clark and Dibble, is also a full-
time student this year. Because
Thurston worked last semester
on a sociology project at Costa
Rica, he had to return to com»
plete his graduation require-
ments. In addition he will assist
in coaching Freshmen football,

Along with eleven other stu-
dents from colleges in the Mine
west Conference, Thurston
studied the problems of Costa
Tivo Grinnell students

with him were Nancy Moritz
on a sociology project and
Chuck Schnell doing work in
biology. Thurston concentrated
on the poverty in the capital
San Jose, interviewing seventy-
five iamilies and discussing
their problems and the urban
migration with them. Although
he was only there six months,
he thought that he had acquired
very valuable field experience.

Wall Speaks of Communiias

The first convocation of the school year drew only minimal
student attendance last Monday evening.

Because of the importance of the two addresses delivered at
the convocation the editors have reprinted below substantial axe
Oerpts from Dr. Wall’s and the complete text of President Leggett‘s.
The 5&B extends a special invitation for responsible student comr
ment on these addresses. Deliver signed responses (typewritten.

Th. Double Nature oi Renewal
Or How to be Good to tho World

Glenn legqett

Students. Faculty, Friends of
the College: As you students,
for whom this convocation is
chielly designed, know better
than any of the rest of us, 1966
is a very difficult time to be a
young person. The world not
only appears to be in worse
state than usual: its older in-
habitants, who are at least part-
ly to blame tor the sorry state
of affairs and thus might wel-
come the dignity oi their own
silence, are likely to be rather
noisy about what they call the
frightful lack of proper ances-
tral piety in the young. it is a
remarkable irony, bearable to
all of us only I suspect because
of the natural affection of
fathers and mothers for their
children and, what is perhaps
more important, because of the
patient attempt at understand-
ing that most of the young bring
to the old.

One hardly needs to offer much
documentation about the condi-

tion of the world. Anyone who
feels and thinks and worries
about his neighbors and him-
self has available all sorts of
evidence about the prevalence or
violence and brutality and o:
the catastrophes brought on by
hypocrisy and hate. The sins
of fathers are certainly being
visited upon their sons, not only
specifically in the tragedy or
racial conflict but also genera
ally in the whole tone of society.
The costs of inhumanity and
vulgarity have been steadily
rising, and even in the short
time between the start of dais
school year and the end at the

Communitos
Joseph Well

It is of this college cone
munity, or communitas, as
Paul and Percival Goodman
use the term in the sense of
the planned and puiposeiul com-
munity, as seen from at least
one faculty member's vantage
point that I should like to
speak this evening. Many of
you who either were at the col-
lege last spring or have had
the opportunity to read his
speech, Will immediately recog-
nize that this theme of com
munity was central to Fresh
dent Leggett’s inaugural ad-
dress. It would seem to me use-
ful to address the large con-
cerns for academic communi-
ty, as expressed by President
Leggett, to the specific prob-
lems which we face in this par<
ticular college.

There are many, of course,
who would tell us that the task
we face is both impossible and
futile. Like the late middle ages
or the early romantic period,
our society seems to be pre-
occupied with the idea of death.
But whereas the lath century
man, with his drawings of grin-
ning skeletons engaged in the
danse macabre, was obsessed
with individual mortality, and
the early 19th century man was
fascinated with the death of
abstract ideas, we seem to lay
emphasis upon the death of
institutions. And second only in
journalistic coverage to the
death or God, which having
made the cover of Time maga-

Convocation

Despite the cavernous backdrop
of Darby gym, the buzzing P. A.
ystem and the ringing telephones,

onday’s convocation was an im-

ressive affair. Full dress assem-

Iages of such academic finery us-
ually are.

Yet there was something very
special about this convocation be-
cause it truly marked the begin-
ning of s new regime. Not only
does the faculty have a dynamic
new leader in Dr. Wall, but Presi-
dent Leggett showed that he has
finished his apprenticeship and is
ready to take full command of the
community.

The foundering indecisiveness
of the last two years seems to be
over and Grinnell may now be rea-
dy to resume the position of aca-
demic leadership which President
Ililowen was instrumental in creat-

g.
This does not mean we can rest
on our laurels—quite the contrary.
What Dr. Wall and President Leg-
gett have done is admit the sad
state of our laurels and pronounce
themselves ready to begin restoring
them.

It is now up to the student body

to assert its willingness to take part
in this restoration. Our task is a
large one. It demands diligence and
imagination in pursuing our com-
mon goal of educational excellence.

This general goal can only be
realized through the specific com-
mitments of all members of the
community to the particular tasks
which have befallen them.

We students must commit our-
selves wholeheartedly to the de-
mands of our studies. But beyond
courses and assignments we must
strive to meet the challenges of the
extracurricular world, whether
these challenges be campus poli-
tics, publications, study groups or
even athletics.

These activities should not be
silly campus games—they should
be a vital and relevant part of the
Grinnell education.

With President Leggett, the time
has come for the student body also
to “summon itself to greatness,”
to commit itself to bettering our
corn-fed little oasis in whatever
manner each of us is able. Only in
so doing can Grinnell achieve a
vital place in our own lives and in
the life of the world.

Chicago

This issue of the SM! contains
a special feature on recent civil
rights activities in Chicago. Given
special coverage is last Sunday’s
march into suburban Cicero.

The problem of the urban civil
rights movement is a crucial one
for America’s future. It demands
the attention and involvement of
all citizens. As students we have a
special responsibility to be in-
formed and active in this area.

Whether we choose to agree or
disagree with the philosophy of
the marchers, it is impossible to
deny the evidence of deep-seated
racial hatred which they have re-
vealed.

This liatred must somehow be
overcome before minority groups

can achieve the full equality which
most of us here at Grinnell support.

The marchers have been con-
demned for inciting violence, and
violence has indeed taken place.
But perhaps it is necessary vio-
lence, a kind of childbirth in the
face of a new world. The marchers
have made comfortable northern
suburbanites face up to their own
prejudices and only time will tell
whether these prejudices can now
be overcome.

In the meantime, the problem
cannot be ignored in the hope that
it will magically fade away. It must
be faced and acted upon, The pen-
ally for failure can only be a pl'
feration, not an end, to Watts-like
incidents.

 

Nous Seeks Contributions

TlliS year a new magazine called Nous
will incorporate the Grinnell Review and
extend its nonfiction material to all of
the nonascience departments on campus.

All students are reminded that if1hey
have anything to contribute, whether it
be a piece of creative writing, a woodcut.
an original musical piece, or a human-
llies paper, every contribution will be
given serious consideration. Contributions
may be made to hall representatives or
to the N005 mailbox.

The gentle chaos of retuming m
Grinnell — unpacking, welcoming old
friends, learning new faces -— was in<
terrupted in a thought-provoking manner
by the opening convocation. The re-
marks of President Leggelt and Mr.
Wall offered a challenge to the students
and the rest of the college to question
constructively the institutions of {his
community and to contribute to die bet<
tement of the Grinnell experience.

in viewing the empty student chairs in
Darby that evening one could only won-
der whether the students would ade-
quately respond to this invitation to in-
volvement. A critical appraisal of our
student culture would seem to reinforce
die {ear that the remarks of Monday
evening are likely to receive little at-
tention or concern. Grinnell students ap-
pear entwined ln a dismal psychology
that excludes a sense of societal motiva-
[ion and commitment. At the heart of
this psychology is the failure of the ma-
jority of students to engage in a sincere,
liberal, intellectual endeavor. While
there is much energy expended in accu‘
mulating facts and information (or as-
signed materlal, there ls little commit-
ment to the idea of scholary enterprise
63111811 an in the context of I. commu-
nity. A narrow self- orientation has
been substituted {or a critical awareness
of ideas, values, and beliefs; and com-
petition for grades too often replaces a
vigorous, cooperative interchange of
viewpoints. Perhaps most saddening is
the lack of a quality of contemporaneity;
for Grinnell students, in contrast to the
same generation elsewhere, display a re.
luclance to immerse themselves in the
moral and social issues of our time.

The symptoms of the lethargy of the
student community can be distinguished
more easily than can its sources. How-
ever, the causal factors derive, perhaps,
from the dominant influence on students
of the culture outside of Grinnell, from
the nature of our educational system,
and from the inadequacies of student
leadership, broadly defined.

The intellectual baggage that smdenis
bring to Grinnell often contains strong
elemems of competitive individualism,
materialism, and status conscmusncss.
These Values militate against the idci
ol 3 communliy dedicated to learning
for learning's sake and proceeding intel-
lectually as a cooperative enterprise.

Our e culiuual slruclure promo:es a
restrictive sell-Concern by judging intel-

lectual achievement through one com.
posite score — the grade point average.
A cost is levied when intellectual curb
osities lead students too far afield of the
present domain of credits and grades.
Moreover, Gtinncll education proceeds
in a misordered sequence. Knowledge is
imparted early, but the techniques and
attitudes necessary to (he self-acquisi-
tion of knowledge are assimilated late
in the college career. Thus, the ability of
Giinnell’s “apprenticescholars” to teach
themselves and each other —« an ability
essential to a scholarly community —- is
inadequately developed.

Finally, campus organizations and
governments — potentially effective links
between the students and the college —
are often uninspiring, tradition-bound.
and hureaucretically overweight. Their
internal motivating force is more he-
quently a desire for peer group approval
and rec itlon than a sense of societal
respons y for the stale of the com-
munity. OpErating according to Parkin-
son’s law, the organizations perpetuate
themselves in narrow, intricate, and he
elflcient fashion.

Unfortunately. these causes of the
psychology of non—community are prob
ably subject to influence — if they can
be inﬂuenced at all — only in the long
run. Such institutions and patterns 0! lie-
havlor change slowly and with difficulty
if attacked from within.

A more immediate impact would den
rive from the compensating iorces of a
rebellion from outside of the present pat-
terns. A rebellion not in the form of pro-
test, but in the form of the establishment
of independent intellectual enterprises.
Research, study, and discussion organ-
ized without regard to their present con-
texts would provide both a motivating
outlet for frustrated curiosities and a
non-restrictive atmosphere in which con-
temporary moral and social dilemmas
could be confronted. Most importantly,
such student activity would constitute a
positive intellectual Contribution to the
community — a contribution that would
be achieved in a cooperative scholarly
fashion and that Wullld force Students to
tench themselves and each other.

Hopellllly, thls college need not pro-
duce only well-trained nlilids but also
individuals who think and act in terms
or values and purposes. With a bit of in-
spiration and independent action, Lllls
year can be more than a dull cadence
of dendlillcs and examinations.

Tile freshmen this year strike me as
not necessarily extraordinary, rather
somolhing out at the ordinary. My first
impression, which i got by just sitting
in the forum grill and trying to observe
something, was or 24 year old girls, 15
year old boys, and more beards of every
kind than I’ve ever seen before, at least
at Grinnell. Oi course all of the beards
weren’t freshmen, It’s getting difficult to
tell [he dilierence between ii freshman
and a beatnik.

I understand that the beatnik cycle
has made a full revolution and is start-
ing again; but 1 saw quite a few Langan
freshmen playing football Sunday, and
it makes me wonder whether creeping
hippiness will strike again. 1 heard
of them talking about their experiences
with Zen, or what they thought was Zen
— I guess they were trying to beard the
lion's den. Even though not “intellectlh
a1" yet, they seem to be intellectually
inclined. One freshman girl asked me
about North Campus nnti-intellectualism
and I answered that the freshmen aren’t
snti~intellectual, just uneducated. She
didn’t hear me.

The freshman girls — God! You just

siolls of the returned npperclassmcn lllS~

freshman handbook. The Oui—Cfﬂi‘dinarb

Realizing that this is the class of 1970
really gets me. i keep thinking that
that’s 10 or 15 years from now. It makes
me wonder how many will get no
farther than Viet Nam or how many will
settle for a Bachelor of Abortion rather
than Arts. I wonder how many think
that all or us really do live in a yellow
submarine.

up a frightful momentum.

in searching for ways to face
this world, and to deal construc-
tively with iLAa search that all
of us in this room, young and
old, are preoccupied with—i
came across two pieces of writ
ing that have some relevance.
The first is a shout poem quoted
by Secretary of Education, John

It goes like this:

The poem was written by a
young unhappy Egyptian dul‘~

The second piece of writing is

some years ago. it goes as fol-
lows:

are concerned both with under-

it right side up, and the double
task is confounded by the prob-

Ed. Note: This story on the
Chicago Freedom Movement
was written by Krys Net-man,
a native or Chicago‘s north
shore suburbs. She took a year
off from school to work on the
staff of Martin Luther King‘s
SCLC, in the slums of wmt
side Chicago. Krys spent the
previous summer working for
ﬁle American Friends Service
Committee in Watts, Calif.

By KRYS NEUMAN

Last fall, as this nation was
just beginning to recover from
its shock over the uprising
against cond‘tions in watts,
Caliiomia, civil rights workers
began gathering in the slums
or Chicago, with the intention
of creating a nonviolent move-
ment which would point out,
more constructively than did
Watts, the ghetto problems oi
the northern city.

Why Chicago Picket

Martin Luther King's South-
em Christian Leadership Con-
ference sent its workers to
Chicago, rather than Los An-
geles. or some other city, for
two reasons: An abundance oi
civil rights and church groups
were already struggling with
the problems there and the
Daley Democratic machine
had the power to change con-
ditions quickly and efficiently
if ending slums ever became
the politically expedient thing
to do.

Today, one year later, it is
evident that Mayor Daley and
oLher City leaders do respond
favorably to some or the issua
brought out by the Movement.
but it is not SB clear that their
committments (on open occu-
pancy, for instance) will be
realized or whether they mere

Iy look good on paper, Further,

have proved to the nation that
Negroes cannot find housing out-
side the ghetto as the situation
stands, but protests have not
brought out important urban
problems such as unemploy-
ment, inferior education and
living conditions, and lack oi
political representation.

Indeed, the northern urban
crisis is so complex and an
times nebulous that trying to
solve it is a frustrating chal:
lenge for the civil rights worka
er with a southern orientation.

The staff of the Southern
Christian Leadership Confer
ence was equipped primarily
for action in the South. Many
of the workers had come from
Alabama, where organizing
people into a movement meant
driving from town to town and
arranging rallies with Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King. ,

Organizing Difficult

In Chicago, the radical, young
Reverend James Bevel direct-
ed the operations of the field
staff as well as the field work
ers of the West Side Christian
Parish. Dr. King, himself, did
not move to Chicago until Jan-
uary, and, even the, organizing
was slow and frustrating work.
Mass demonstrating, the tactic
that pulls people together
quickly, was impossible in the
cold winter.

In the early stages of the
Movement in Chicago, many
hours were spent in staff dis
cussions on the many forces
that create slums and on the
single issue that would move
people to work to end them,

What Makes Ghetto

The staff found that once
southern Negroes moved into
northern ghettos the pattern
at poverty and discrimination
kept them conhned there.
Since education in the ghetto is
inferior, residents have limit-
ed joh potential. Slum dwellers
oiten exist on modest welfare
Checks or'low income wages.
Without the income, adequate
housing is out at the question.
The vicious circle is complete
because low income housing
areas generally have your
schools.

Breaking up the ghetto ap-
peared to be the only way to
terminate the recurring pat-
tern.

Housing seemed to be the
Common denominator; anyone
who lives in the ghetto lives
in a slum Even those Negroes
with money to move to n nicer
area were refused entrance.
And staying in the ghetto does
not mean Cheaper housing be-
cause rents are inflated about
fifteen per cent above done in
white neighborhoods. Although
slum dwellers pay higher
rents, the money usually does
not go toward building im-
provemenls.

Tenants Take Control

The Idea behind a lenaiils'
union is that organized tenants
would have the power to with-
hold their rents and to use [his
money for repairs if the [and
lord did not get the work do!
on his own. it necessary, the
building might have to move out
of the hands of the owner
and be put in ti‘usleeshlp, prob-
ably lo a bank.

End Slums Union

The union was begun in East
Garfield Park, a section of
Chicago's West Side. It was
called the Union to End Slums
and was divided into eight geo-
graphical areas, called Locals.
About three Staff members
were assigned to work with
community people in organiz-
ing each Local. The task was
monumental as there were
thousands of family units in
each Local, Neither staff nor
community leaders had the ex-
perience needed tor this level
of organizing.

Some staff members learned

iiilti‘ iiil:ttii:lt:

that they were better equipped
to work with gang youth or in
the office while others stayed
out in the ﬁeld. High school
and college students irom all
over Chicago helped partrtime.
In the summer, sortie college
students lived with neighbol‘«
hood families and worked for
the Union at subsistance pay,
The YMCA and church groups
had special grants to support
them, Thanks to these summer
volunteers operations could he
stepped up temporarily.

Demands on City

In June, warm w e a th e r
brought the expectation or
demonstrations, so the Union
presented its demands about
ending slums to the city.
Thirty - live to forty thousand
marched with Martin Luther
King to post the demands on
the door or City hall.

With thousands or marchers.
a real Chicago Freedom Move-
merit began. The emphasis or
“End Slums" activities shifted
to white neighborhoods to test
one of the demands » open
occupancy. White and Negro
workers Visited realtors in
while neighborhoods, asking to
see “lor sale" listings. When it
was clearly established that, in
a given neighborhood, the white
worker could do business but
the Negro was turned away,
that area became the Site of all
open occupancy march. Re.
peated matches, in about five
different neighborhoods, were
necessary beiore Dr. King
could elicit promises from City
OfiiClalS and the Real Eslale
Board that Movement demands
would be met. These \veie
made only alter many maiclt
crs had been injured by mobs
or white hecklers, screaming
and hurling rocks, bollles and
cherry bombs.

Hostility in North
Following one match, pic~
tures of Dr. King, staggering
from a thrown brick, appeared
on front pages all over the
country. Allerwal‘ds, Dr, King
said, “I thought there Woilld
be hostilityi But I never expect-
ed anything like this. i have
never seen such hate — not in

Mississippi or Alabama."
Some Negro groups in Chic-
ago ieel that Dr. King "sold

‘1lllllliﬂ‘t‘illlzlilil' :,

out" to the City; that the pro
mises he received are meaning-
less and ~ or limited, These
groups, like the CORE march-
ers in Cicero, say they will
continue to march on dieir own.

Many thousands of Chicago's
Negroes have not responded at
all to the nonViolent movement.
In the middle of the summer.
Chicago's West Side ghetto.
like so many others across the
nation, broke out in violent
racial discord.

Broader Issues Soon

SCLC's year in Chicago has
definitely been fruitful, how
ever, and the organization has
plans to stage future demon-
strations. The staff aims not to
overlook the weltare, employ-
ment and educational problems
in the tight for decent housing.

Then. also, the Union to
End Slums is growing daily as
more buildings join the active
Locals and as more tenants re<
eeive bargaining rights in cons
tracts with their landlords.

At die present time, there are
ﬁve new Unions all over the
City or Chicago. Two Unions
on the West Side, the East
Garfield Union to End Slums
and the Lawndale Union are
beginning a massive rent strike
against one slum owner with
many holdings in both areas
who will not [ix his buildings,
rlor sign a contract. All six
unions recently began holding
some common meetings to
shale problems and discuss
structure and tactics.

By HENRY WILHELM

Last Sunday: march into Cicero, an
all white suburb of Chicago, was a sigt
nliicant change lrom the previous, none
violent, demonstrations of the summer.
This time the marchers were prepared
to fight back if attacked. And according
to some or the more outspoken leaders.
the Negroes were prepared to use tire
arms it necessary. The change in Ne-
gro attitude was Ieadlly apparent as
many of the Negro marchers yelled in-
sults back at the angry, screaming white
crowds. The Call of “Black Power" was
irequently heard.

The Cicero March may have set the
tone tor civil rights action in the iuture
both in Chicago and other Cities. Many
observers say that the militant teelings
expressed in Cicero are the natural out-
come oi the lock or any real progress
oi the nonviolent approach in the north.
Important also is the fact that there
were fewer white people in the Cicero
March than in the previous non-violent
marches in Chicago. Part or the ieeling
of Black Power is the assertion of the
Negro male and the Cicero March had
far fewer of the Women and Children
than have been typical or other marches.
For the Negro man who has long been
used to suitering insult and degredation
irom whites, Cicero was a chance to
speak his mind.

A Cicero March was tirst planned by
Martin Luther King's Chicago Freedom
Movement, but was later called of}
when Chicago's Mayor Daley and the
Chicago Real Estate Board promised to
work toward ending the housing discrim-
lnalion that has for years kept much of
Chicago closed to Negro families Some
or the Negro groupshincluding com:

which led the march, were not satisﬁed

with the King agreement and ignored
the ban on marches.

The residents of Cicero are almost all
of recent immigrant background, mosrly
Polish, Bohemian and Italian. Many of
them had come to the U.S. to escape
Hitler and the Germany of World War
ll, however this background did not
seem to stop them [mm enlhusiasticall
displaying swastikas and yelling Nazi
slogans. A delegation ot Nazi's and mem-
bers of the Ku Klux Klan were stopped
by police on the way to Cicero, and th
week before a KKK group was attested
walking in downtown Cicero dressed in
tull regalia.

Cicero is a well kept City of nice homg
{or the most part. The residents have
worked hard to make it so and want to
keep it so. This combined with the more
typical ieelings oi second generation in.
migrants who have had to struggle to
make it and don’t want to lose anything,
made for the hostility shown in Cicero
last Sunday. ‘

Cicero, an industrial city of 70,000,
which has no known Negro resident, had
not been the target of previous open-
occupancy marches because oi the ce -
talnty of violent repercussions. It was
being saved as a iinal step to convince
Daley that it would be in his polit' ’
interest to meet some of the Negro’s de-
mands rather than have his city iurthe
embarrassed by violence. The last tim
a Negro tried to live in Cicero, in 133,
a riot ensued that took the Nationa
Guard to control, Cicero is also wel
known as the home and stronghold of A
Capone in the 1920s. ‘

’The press also turned out in force, in

present. A Japanese photographer was
seen photographing the mob framed be-
tween a Guardsman with an autumatic
“lo and another operating a jeep

iorelgn publicily that Chicago, already
internationally known as the “Gangster
91y," and the us. is getting, is thought
by many to be a great help in convincing
Washington that something must be done
to alleviate the Negro problem,

The march did not actually stir much
violence other than some thrown rocks,
bottles, cherry bombs, and a iew scuf-
fles between Whites and police, whites
and Negroes, and whites and Guards-
men. The police did a generally eiiee.
ﬁve job of keeping things under control
and the presence or machine gun carry-
hig Guardsmen had a delinite sobering
inﬂuence. No one was shot, as had been
ieared would happen. ,

CORE says that it will march in Cicero
again, though no date has yet been set.
Robert Lucas, head 0‘ Chicago CORE
commented on Sunday’s march by say-
4mg, "I think it was a great grass-roots
march.” The residents of Cicero prob

What It Means
For The Nation

Ed. Notel The following rm
port was written by John
Phillips, a former Griunell
student. Phillips recently
spent two months in Selma,
Alabama as a reporter -
photographer for the South-
on. Courier. The Courier was
organized by a group of Har-
vard students last year to
cover southem racial news.

By JOHN PHILLIPS

During die Student Non-vlo~
lent Coordinating Committee’s
(SNCC) summer project of 1964
in Mississippi many Northern-
ors flooded the state, helping
with voter registration drives
and teaching in freedom
schools. when the majority or
the outsiders lelt the state at
the end of the summer the
Negroes were left completely
confused and essentially with-
out leadership.

Once again the Negro had
been taken care of by the
While man. SNCC decided that
the time had come to begin

compensating for the hundreds
of years that the Negro was
told that he couldn’t do any-
thing ior himself. It was time
for the Negro to begin having
pride in himself. This is the
concept of “black power," al-
though Lhe phrase itself was
coined by Stokely Carmichael,
chairman or SNCC, only a low
months ago during the More
dith Mississippi March no em—
phasize the potential of the Neg-
roe vote,

The recent controversy over

Black Power In Chicago

BLACK POWER was conceived b

Carmichael’s phrase has re-
volved around the precise in-
terpretation of “black power,"
Strictly speaking, the power
Carmichael originally had in
mind was political power.

Carmichael to Lawndes

Carmichael came to Lowndes
County, Alabama just after the
Selma March of ’65. Alriog with
other SNCC staff workers he
encouraged the development or
the Lowndes County Freedom
Organization (Black Panther)
political party. Lowndes is the
most poverty stricken of all
Alabama counties with an 80
per cent Negro population re-
ceiving a median ramily in-
come one iourth that of the
white population Until last
year not a single Negro had
ever registered to vote, Ninety
white families own 9|) per cent
at the land. While the major-
ity of the whites live in virtual
luxury, the majority of the
Negroes live in dire poverty
which in some areas of the
county achieves a level as low
as any to he found in our
country.

Showcase of Democracy

The Lowndes County Free-
dom organization is virtually
assured of success in its bid
to elect its representatives to
the major county offices in
November. These offices in
clude Sheriff, tax assessor and
seats on the school board. The
candidates are farmers and
housewwes. The grass roots
leadership and community
spirit that made this all pos-
sible constitute a showcase of
democratic process which is
remarkable to observe. The
spirit, courage, and uneducated

completely oppressive while
power structure on every lev-
e1, will probably become
legend in American history.
Even more important, it will
become legend in American
Negro culture. Only by having
their entire county gerryman-
dered out of existence by 60%
ernor Wallace can the Black
Panthers be stopped from ob-
taining political and ﬁnancial
control at Lowndes. Ten other
counties iu Alabama have a
majority oi Negroes oi voting
age and those which don't have
a majority could pooenlially con-
tain powerful blocks of Negro
votes for bargaining purposes.
The difference with Lowndes is
that its residents were organ-
ized out of their former tear
and into a black political pow-
er structure.

More Than Political Power

The story of black power in
Lowndes County is impressive
enough of itself, but practically
speaking black power is more
than simply political power.
Says Carmichael, “It's amazing
to see what those two words
did to White America. Black

Whatever its original inten-

presently in tune with the tenor
of nearly every Negro organiza-
tion that actively or passively
allows itself to think in terms of
a Negro revolution in America.
in a sense the phrase black
power marks an ever-increasing
distinction between the civil
rights movement in the Uulted
States and the larger Negro
revolution. Ask any white and

coming November elections.

former SNCC worker about that
distinction. He’ll understand it
well.

A Negro must have faith in
himself plus power and L‘hat’s
black power. Where do militant
demonstrations and riots in
Northern ghettos fit in to this
statement? Carmichael scoffs at
the comment that he tries to
stir up tension, trouble, and
riots. He says that the tension
is already there, especially in
cities, and for good reason. He
goes on, “The tragedy is that
last year's riots were so unor-
ganized that the leaders weren't
able to use them to get some
01' the things they needed."

Respect Essential

The fact that so many people
disapprove of the term black
power is to SNCC beautifully
ironic testimony to its validity
and effectiveness as a slogan,
In the South and North alike an
element essential to progress
in the Negro revolution is not
only respect of Negroes for
themselves but respect of the
white man for the Negro. An
element crucial to this respect
is fear. The Negro must have
the potential pl striking tear in
the white World as the white
man has struck fear tor so long
in the world or the Negro.

To give this respect substance
it is necessary tor the Negro
to prove his “black power pl)<
tential" whether it be in terms
of political and economic power
in the cities. Initial demonstra<
tinns ui lhis power must or
necessity he exaggerated just
as the unleashing of atomic
power upon Hiroshima might be
considered to have been an ex-
aggerated but necessary display
oi power. A certain amount of

merica have been so grossly
mistreated that until recent
times they were in a kind of
shock which whites commonly
termed apathy and ignorance.
That's wearing on now. The
sooner white America wakes up
to this newly expanding power,
the sooner racial violence will
disappear. This doesn't mean
bigger and better police forces
It means eliminating every as‘
pect of a caste system in the
United States through every
means and resource available.
If white America, which con-
trols the vast majority or A-
merica's political and eoonnmis
power. doesn't assume this task
voluntarily, it will soon become
a dire necessity. The only alter-
native will be to operate Ameri-

brutally suppress what are only

bers of Americans.

VIRGIN (A’s..-

Wisconsin and a few other
large state universities, how.
ever, have known how to uti-
lize bigness so that it has corp
tributed to educational excel-
lence.

we who as iacully, students
or administrators at Grinnell
College have committed our
talents and/or a sizable part
of our tather's salary check to
the small liberal arts college
must in the same way try to
utilize our smallness so that lt
may contribute to educational
excellence more effectively
and imaginatively than we
have so far done.

Or I could cite the example,
last tail, of an attempt upon
the part or some students to
establish several small dISCuS<
sion groups to deal with the
Viet Nam question in which in
each group there would be
joint participation oi students
and iaculty representing sever-
al different areas of concentra
tion. This was an excn‘lng idea,
for we were to deal with the
most pressing and controvers-
slal issue on the contemporary
scene in a far more education
ally constructive manner than
by picket lines or armbands,
however sympathetic i may be
to those terms or protest. The
groups were iormed. an elabor-
ate bibliography was compiled,
but then the faculty members
became involved in their regu-
Iar teaching assignments and
committee duties, the students
tound themselves irantically
caught up in the regular roue
tine oi papers, lab reports and
examinations. There was no
one to push the proiect, and an
important educational idea
died aborning.

In short. we have not eliec~
tively and imaginatively made
use of our smallness to my
mate a liberal arts education.
Our failure is not for want of
ideas. Pi-oiessor Magee has tor
the last year and a halt pro
moled the idea of inter < dis-
ciplinary seminars in which at
least two iaculty members,
representing dlflerent dis -
pliiies, would conduct a semb
nar for from ten to iitteen up<
perclass students on such top-

Some people say iliey wouldn't
walk across his sheet on our pix-
Ia. Others say ilrey wouldn‘t even
go to lheir lounges for it But you

don't have to H we‘ll deliver to

ice as existentialism, race rela-
tions, or the problems or new
developing nations in which
an inter-disciplinary approach
would quite obviously be the
most eifectlve devise for deals
ing wrth the subject matter.
Faculty members participating
in these joint seminars would,
of course, receive full teaching
credit for their participation.
Protessor Alan Jones, recently
returned irom the University or
Sussex, has proposed to me the
possibility ol combining the
traditional American class-
room and the British tutorial
situation by which experimenta-
tion and variety could he intro«
duced into the routine semester
course as it now exists.

“Grinnell, our catalogue says
and in italics so that it cannot
be missed, “is a small col-
lege." But smallness, as Presi-
dent Leggett has said, is no
virtue in itself. There is Very
little educational signiiicance
in having only lzoo as opposed
to 2000 soudents on a college
campus. But smallness does
begin to acquire educational
signiﬁcance it we can say that
there are never more than
twenty students in a single
class section

What my colleagues and I
are suggesting is, of course,
expensive education, but Grim
neli is already expensive, We
would I think find it easier to
justify a somewhat higher tui-
tion than the present already
high tuition. it by so doing we
could more effectively utilize
the community lhat is the col—
lege with all oi its possibilities
for experimentation and the ex-
change of ideas.

Finally, as an essential part
of this idea of communitas is
the necessity for an accurate.
rair and even critical presenta»
tion to our alumni and to the
world at large through the
various publication media of
the college as to what we are
doing at the college now, and
what our plans and aspirations
for the iuture may be. This
requires the closest kind or
cooperation between students,
faculty and administrative
start. Our respective hopes and

goals for this college are not,
1 think, as different and con-
tradictory as they sometimes
appear when we compare loi-
example. what appears in the
regular student SEtB with what
appears in the Alumni 5&3.
This college, like all colleges,
is more than a place, a
physical envrronment it is es<
sentially an idea — the idea
of educational excellence that
is held in common by all who
serve it in whatever capacity.
And it is the particular tomi pt
that idea as it continues to de-
velop here that we are seeking
to express to borers. Certainly

as a college is strong enough
and self - conﬁdent enough to
be able to criticize itself and
to grow stronger as a result
of that criticism. We have made
great progress during the past
ten years toward educational

political life of this country

creative growth altemate with
periods of consolidation [or gains
already made can be applied
with equal appropriateness to
the life of an academic com-

ready to move Into a new cy<

exceedingly bright and attrac-
tive new lreshman class to join
the more sophisitl'cated, and
not, i mist, more jaded upper
classmen. We have a properly
restless faculty, and we have
a new presidential administra-

that there will be on the cams

nature of the problem. For so
long had Southerners been ac-
customed to the apathy of the
Negroes that during the last ten
years the mere vision of a
group of Negroes walking down
the street was suificiem to al.-
tract attention and concern.
This was phase one. As the
southern Negro b e c o m e s
trapped in the ghettos of the
northern city his awareness of
his status in society is inten-
sified. Conditions which in some
ways are far worse than in the
South amplify his discontent.
Riots are an inevitable occur-
rence and might be considered
phase two, the phase of this
decade. Whether riots are spon-
taneous or externally ignited is
almost irrelevant. The. kindling
is there and gets drier each
moment,

The certainty of riots and
more riots in the northern cities
unless something drastic is done
to avoid them, ioreshadows sim~
ilar reactions in the South as
Negro pride and self-awareness
reach higher and higher levels
relative to conditions,

Drr King and SCLC in Chicago
have thus far been Very cautious
about openly speaking in terms
of “black power." However.
King is well aware that his best;
bargaining position with Mayor
Daley over specifi issues is the
tool that "peaceiul" demonstra-
tions may easily become vio-
Ient. King may be diplomatic in
handling it, but the essence of
his strength is his ability to
cause disturbances which are
highly embarrassing to a city
and which will get a response,
if only for the reason that
they're violent.

In its larger sense the real
essence of black power is that
the militant Negro is tired of
iruitiessly struggling with symp-
toms of his problem in America
(such as segregation) and is
tired of watching half his broth-
ers lie back in fear and apathy
while the other half struggles to
achieve acceptance as a white
man. The militant wants accep-
tance of the Negro for what he
