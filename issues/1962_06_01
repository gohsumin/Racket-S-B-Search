5&3 toasts sihool year with review of highlights

by Sin“ \Vl‘itel‘

It’s been an exciting year
at Grilinell as 29 issues of
the Scarlet and Black will
attest. '

Big story of September 15
was, of course, the freshmen.
“Class of ’65 begins year 3'
strong.” the headline pr -
claimed. Sandwiched i ii
‘amoilg the welcomes from
Gi'inliell merchants in that
first issue were a promise
that the Brothers Four would
entertain over the weekend. an
editorial iiiviciivc against picn-
ping, an inter icw with new
Dean oi Men Stephen E. Wood

and a fifth-place Conference
prediction for the football team.

Harrington vs. Lewis _
The next week, open house in

Socialist Michael Hai ington and
Young Americans ior Prccdom
organizer Fulton Lewis, iii,

a 3.1 were announced as the top
halls scholastically for the
previous scmcstcr. Ground was
broken tor Barber Plaza and,
down in the corner on the iront
page, an “announcement or ‘.“‘
tcrcst to all" was promised tor
the following Monday.

The announcement resulted
in this llemllino in the next
SS.) “Grinnell i‘ece' cs 52
million grant from Ford.” The
Ford Foundation had agreed
to give Gl'inncll that much if
it could raise an additional $4
million by June 30, 1964.

Queen Pamela

The testing question

Big news in the iollowing is~
sue came under this headline:
“Senators attended special meet»
ing." Topic of concern was a
resolution presented by Student
Government Association Presis
dent Bill Halama opposing re»
sumption or nuclear testing in
the atmosphere by the United
States. Tabled until the next
week when it was passed, the
resolution was sent to President
Kennedy, Secretary oi Defense
Robert McNamara and other
high government orticials. Im-
pact or the question was reflect-
ed in two iuil pages or “letters
to the editor" which appeared in
the November 10 issue, some
supporting the Senate’s move,
others condemning it,

Meanwhile. the Capchnrt-
Humphrey debate had come
and gone. Two lull pages of
news told how the two solons
had responded to moderating
journalist clarlt Mouenhuff's
question: Humphrey — “Coop-
erativc, planned action on the
part at every participant in a
Free society is the only way
to preserve trccdom;“ Cape-
linrt — “What we need is
more business in Washington
and less government in busi-
ness.”
