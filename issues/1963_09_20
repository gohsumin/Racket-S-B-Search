Grinnell and Civil Rights

Six children are dead in Birmingham. Birmingham’s
16th Street Baptist church is partially destroyed. Else—
where in the South—in Georgia and Mississippi—integra-
tion in the schools continues as the exception rather than

the rule.
The Sunday school deaths jarred America. The dogs,

the cattle prods, the high pressure hoses all seemed un-
real—removed. But the deaths of children are inescap-
able. Newspapers across the country were enraged. A
banner headline in the Pittsburg Courier read: “U. S.
MUST ACT NOW!”

Spurred by the American civil rights crisis and par-
ticularly by the deaths in Birmingham, a sympathy march
“aimed at bringing the problems of civil rights to the im-
mediate attention of the people of Iowa" has been organgd
by the students of Iowa State University.

Through demonstrations (such as the march scheduled
for Sunday) ; through contributions to groups like the 8012b
ern Christian Leadership Conference, the Student Nonvio—
lent Coordinating Committee, ,the Committee on Racial
Equality; through letters to our Congressmen; and through
our social attitudes we must‘become a part of this battle

for equality.

SCARLET AND BLACK

Once upon a time lasi week an innocent
young Grinnell student had an amazing exper-
icncc.

“Imagine that,” he mumbled rather astonished-
ly to himself. ”A real live, honest to goodness,
really and truly, no foolin’ around beatnik!"

“Imagine that,” he mumbled again.

Yes, for the first time in his life he lay his
innocent young eyes on a living specimen of
a member of an almost extinct sect known as
“beatniks.” Quickly he narrowed his Eyes suspics
iosuly as he tried to recall the Words in his
sociology text.

“Let‘s see,‘ he thought aloud, “a beatnik is
a retreatist who denies inc desirability of
success and refuses to conform to the xcqincc-
merits of middle class mortality and in addition
does not offer any alternatives Yes, that’s how
it went," he said pcnsivcly lo himscli.

The United States National Student Associa-
tion has been subject to heavy criticism from
many quarters ever since its foundation in 1547.
Every spring the Grinnell College Student Sens
ate must decide whether or not to continue our
membership in the organization, and at that
time there is always vocal criticism of USNSA’s
policies and procedures. In part this results from
the simple {act that you cannot please every-
body at once, but many of the protests have
been directed at important shortcomings in the
organizations.\

Some of the most common criticisms of
USNSA in the past have been concerned with
the manner in which many resolutions are pass-
ed. Resolutions at the National Student Congress
are initiated in five separate committees. Each
'delegate to the Congress is a member of one
of these committees. Any and all resolutions
passed by the committees are brought to the
plenary floor for consideration by the entire
Congress. The difficulty in this process arose
from the fact that an enormous volume of legiss
lation was coming from the committees (over
100 resolutions in 1962).

The Congress, in its limited time, could not
possibly consider all of fhcsc bills. Rather
than let those hills dic completely without
consideration, a procedure was devised in
which all bills not considered by the Congress
were cclci-i-ed to the National Executive Com-

“llnaglne that," he said again, still not quite
sure that he was looking upon a real live beat-
nik. \

“You’re real, aren’t you," he asked appre
hensively, afraid that the beatnik might not
answer and disappear into a puff of smoke.

“Oi course I‘m real!” the beatnik said with
a yawn. “Everybody asks me that question. It’s
all quite tiresome by now, you know. I sup—
pose you’re going to ask me to prove it or some—
thing?”

“Prove it , . or something," the young
Grinnell student said defiantly!

“Oh well, if you insist."

“l insist," the young innocent Grinne11_ stu-
dent said insistently.

ly and uuly, no foolin‘ around beatnik disappearr

mitten for ﬁnal action. The NEC is a 28-mem»
bei- hoard composcd of the chairmen of the
various regions of USNSA plus the national
officers. Since the Congress has usually been
able to consider only 25 to so bills’in its limited
time, this procedure resulted in about 75
per cent of the policy statements of the or-
ganization being considered by 23 people. The
effect of this situation on the representative
nature of the bills passed is clear.

At this year’s National Student Congress, the
referral of legislation to the NEC has been efe
fectively ended. First, the number of resolu-
tions coming to the ﬂoor from the committees
has been limited to 31 pieces. ‘

Secondly, all mention of referral to the NEC
has been Stricken from the constitution, by-laws,
and the Congress rules,

Finally, the NEC has been dissolved and has
been replaced by 3 Congress Steering Committee,
which will be concerned mostly with the me-
chanics of the Congress. The resolutions passed
by the Congress determine the policy and pro-
gram of USNSA throughout the year. In the
future, all such resolutions will be passed by
die plenary session or not at all, the delegates
from each member school voting upon them. (An
explanation of the resolutions passed at this
year‘s Congress will appear in next week’s Scar-

Uncle Sam's Opens Registration

[Encampment Needs Fran/mess

Every college is regularly presented with
problems, and to meet these problems, the insti-
tutlon creates problem-solving machinery (i.e.
student deans, curriculum Committees, or a pres-
ident’s round table), There is an increasing ten
dency among American universities and colleges
to infrcducc students into this machinery in
order to create greater support for institutional
policies, to encourage student responsibility, and
above all, to bring to bear the maximum intel—
lectual force on common problems.

The phenomenon ambiguously called the Grins
nell College Encampment is one such attempt to
involve the students in the problem-solving pro-
cess. Student involvement could be accomplished
far more economically if a conference equiva-
lent to the Encampment were to be held on the
campus itself. The theoretical justification for
this expense lies in the nature of the shortcom-
ings of the problem-solving machinery.

Because the solution of common problems de-
pends on communications, these shortcomings
are, as one would suspect, rooted in failures of
communication. You have heard of the “dialogue”
between the different groups within the col-

lege community.'Thc dialogue between students
and college administrators has, at times, failed
for various reasons. One reason is the occasional
lack of frankness on one or both sides. Another
reason is that this dialogue is oficn conducted by
rumor, a process which results in distortion.

Still another reason is the occasional inabil-
ity of either or both sides to divorce themselves

from positions which are partially acquired by
a long association with a certain group, These
differences may be exaggerated by the formal-
ity of meeting in an office. One more criticism
would be that the dialogue, as opposed to a con-
versation, takes place over an extended period
of time; too much time between statement and
reply is conducive to misunderstanding,

Some oi these shortcomings exist to a degree
on every campus. The Encampment proposes to
meet these shortcomings by allowing a cross-sec»
tion of students, faculty and administration to
converse rationally in an informal atmosphere‘
isolated from the campus. The dialogue will bel
immediate and (hopefully) lively and frank.

The emphasis so far on the solution of prob»
lems should not obscure the equally valuable
function of the encampment of concentrating
original thought on the future of the college. An
institution which is content to deal with problems
as they arise will find that problems will never
cease to arise. By looking ahead it is hoped that
the participants of the Encampment will make
suggestions for policy changes which would con.
stitute better means for satisfaction of the ends
the college now pursues. Nor should these ends

themselves be exempt from rational criticism.

Despite a superior environment for rational
discussion, the Encampment is subject to the
severe limitations of time and unprofessional
opinion. Because of these limitations, the Encamp-
ment is not intended to be a quasi~legislative
body antecedent to Senate action.

F mm For

As Grinnell’s only married beatnik entering
his fifth year at this institution, l have been
requested to write a short article, directed to»
wards the incoming freshmen. So here it is.

You freshmen have received a great deal of
,talk from various dignitaries during the past
two weeks, concerned with what your Liie at
Grinnell will be like, what percentage of you
can be expected to have a Positive Experience
here and so forth. 1 would like here to simply
add a small list of practical hints to the welter
of statistics and reassurances; I hope they will
he of some value to some of you.

Practical Hints
1) Don’t worry about your clothes.

2) Don't call up girls you don’t like and
ask them out,

3) If you are sitting in a room full of peo—
‘ple who are boring you, do not stay there
smoking innumerable cigarettes and trying to
think of anecdotes from your high school days.
Leave.

4) Don’t be afraid to eat breakfast alone.
5) Don‘t fall prey to the suspicion that all

SCARLET AND BLACK

Descent

upperclassmen know something you don’t.
6) Don’t turn anybody in.

7) Paint your own pictures, and hang them
on the wall.

8) Don’t wear a beanie, unless you ordinar—
ily wear a beanie. Nobody can do anything to
'yol}.

9) no not at any time assume the adminis—
tration of this school to be either unduly wise
or unduly benevolent, Be very careful when
committing serious crimes.

10) if you happen to be walking down the
sidewalk singing and someone approaches you
going the other way, don't stop singing.

Some of these things, notably numbers three,
eight, and ten, may prove to be very difficult.
If you think they prove too difficult, the remedy
for this is to screw your courage to the sticking'
point. Finally. in case anyone thinks I’m acting»
holier than thou l s’nould like it known that U
have been guilty of every error and negligence
outlined above; and the only reward l have for
all of it is the ability to compile a list like this,l
which I hereby bequeath to you, the class of 1967. i

Panel Agrees Nu

By Phil Bernstein

A coffee hour on the subzcct
of “Extra Curricular Activities:
Boon or Boondoggle?” was held
in Younker lounge on Wednes
day. Directed primarilyvat fresh-
men, the program was a panel
discussion in which SGA Pres-
ident Jack Chapman, IRC Pres»
ident Curt Lamb, Speaker. of the
Senate Ed Robbins and the Grin-
nell Student Peace Group lead-
er Nick Dicken debated the var
ious merits and drawbacks of
the extracurricular program at
Grinnell.

Chapman argued that there
are, on campus, too many clubs
and, as a result, most have
mediocre programs. ”Too few
Clubs." he said, “do anything
but bring in speakers for cof-

mber of Clubs I

Affects Good Program Planning

fee hours and lectures." He
added that many students at-
i tend these coffee hours only
‘ to escape from work.

This last point was echoed by
the other three panelists nl.
though they all pointed out that
the coffee hour could be a source
of intellectual stimulation on
campus if given better prepara—
tion.

Chapman’s remedy to the sit—
uation would be cut down on
the number of coffee hours and
to concentrate on a few well<
planned events each year.

Touching on the issue or SGA,
Chapman cited the mushroom-
ing bureaucracy that now
plagues our student government
in which nearly one out of four
Grinnellians serve in some ca—
,pacity.

_ By Len Calodney

This season, more than any other in recent Midwest
Conference football history, advantageous scheduling will
probably be important in determining the Conferencel
champ. Not only is the number of home games played,
among the top five picks significant, but their order is
also impoltant.

Ripon, given the top draw on a basis of persons
nel, will have a tough time coming through four succes-
sive weeks of One, Carleton, Lawrence, and St. Olaf (only
the Viking game being at home) without spotting their
record. The Redmen are looking for quarterback Jack An-
kerson to lead them over these opponents and the f0)‘mld~‘
able Pioneers whom they meet tomorrow.

Scheduling‘breaks greatly influenced the Choosing
of C02, Lluvrence, and Grinnell for the next three spots
respectively. Although losing some key men, the Kid
hawks got some breaks elsewhere: if they can survive
the Ole and Redlnan contests on the Second and third
weekends of the season, they have two comparatively
easy games before meeting Gl'innell at home, and an-
other “rest” before facing Lawrence in their finale.
The Vikings, meanwhile, play three of their top four op-
ponents at home as a boost to their cause. However,
they meet: Ripon away the Weekend after hitting the Pio-
neers, and the prospect of playing above .500 ball here
is slim. .

The Pioneers, on the other hand, have the misfortune
of catching the top three picks all on the road, meeting
only number five selection, St. Olaf, on Ward Field. There

won‘t have to meet any two of their most distinguished
opponents in a row.

St. Olaf, ‘muste ng some of its usual power, has been
selected to fill the fifth position, and has the opportunity
of playing both Coe and Ripon at Nol‘thlﬁeld. Usually
strong Carleton and Cornell have slipped somewhat in the
poll this year and occupy the sixth and seventh rungs on
the ladder.

While Beloit, Monmouth, and Knox seem to have
more promise than in the past few seasons, they probably
won’t be able to break out of the bottom three Slots.

One MCAC coach has commented that he thinks the
winner this year will have two losses. If this is the case,
there is a good possibility of another three way tic, remi-
niscent of the tight Conference race two years ago.

An inexperienced freshman
cross country l‘eam began work
outs this week under coach Dick

-Young.

Only two of the fresh, Dcnnis
Gallagher and Glenn Elliot, have
had previous cross country ex-
perience. The remainder oi the
squad are newcomers to the
sport.

Gallagher, who was named
captain of the freshman team,
has been working out with the
varsity for two weeks. Coach
Young reports that he has good
cross country potential.

Other team members are
Charles Berkey, Torn Bezanson,
Burt McDowell, John Milne, Ed-

“Hey Mac, where can I ﬁnd
the local bookie?”

“Just go to the local pet store
and ask for Max.”

As 1 entered the store 1 no.
;ticed one of the north campus
1house presidents buying a bowl
‘of guppies for hall mascots, 1
asked the proprietor it he knew
Max; 1 was escorted through the
back door into a dimly lit,
smokceﬁlled room.

1 was introduced to Max. He
was a short but stocky man‘ with
a well preserved build, and 1
naturally presumed that he was
lthe product of Saga food. I was
told that Max was one of the
most promising jocks in Grin»
nell 1M history, but injuries suse
taincd during a water tight end-
ed his chance for stardom.

The blackboard over Max’s
desk listed the predictions for
the football competition. They
were as follows:

Max said that most of the 10-
cal bookies were 'worried about
a long shot winning because of
the possible talent of the fresh»
man. His three top choices for
the over-all winner of the Mac-

‘Murray Trophy are Smith, ‘North

and Dibble.
Just. as I was about to leave

of the ﬁrst day’s games came
over the wire — Dibble over
Smith, 28-6; Gates Dv‘er Langan,
1370; and Cowles over West,
13-0. ‘

Max refused to take any bets
on the tennis tournament. which
begins in about a week. He said
it was “just too uncertain.”

“I had thought, without any

better shape," commented coach
Dick Young. All runners posted

Halt Charging Baby Elephants:

By Karen Adkinson

Ever walked'a baby wolf cub
or dug a grave? These are some
of the things Grinnell students
did in the course of their sum-
mer jobs.

Nancy Self worked in the
Children’s Zoo in St. Louis as
an attendant. Part of her job
was to exercise some of the anie
mals such as “the llamas and
wolf cubs by strolling them
around the zoo. She also pre-
pared 75 formulas a day for
baby bottles, including one for.
mula of elephant milk with
crushed bananas or tomatoes in
it.

“From my job 1 think I learn.

]ed that people are much funnier

than animals,” Nancy said. “It
usually wasn’t the kids who ask.
ed the stupidest questions, it
was their parents. For example,
a baby llama bears absolutely
no resemblance to any kind of
a rabbit, yet we had a cage with
baby rabbits and baby llamas in
it and every day you could count
on someone asking whether the
llamas were the parents oi the
rabbits. ,

“incidentally, do you know
how to stop a 350 pound charg—

Freshman Girl

Women’s Club of Des Moines to
Grinnell College has been allo-
cated as a scholarship for a
freshman from Des Moines, col-
lege officials have announced
today.

The scholarship has been a~
warded to Kay M. Rhodes. Miss
Rhodes is a 1963 graduate of
Abraham Lincoln high school,
Des Moines, where she was an
honor student and active in
school affairs.

Mrs. Paul MacEachron of 5420
Ingersoll Ave., Des Moines, is
president of the Des Moines

ing baby elephant? i know this
sounds like an elephant joke;
but really the best way to stop
an elephant is to stick your
thumb in its mouth.”

Grinnell's grave digger was
Manly staley, who spent his
summer working at. a ceme-
tery in his home town of Can-
ton, Ill. Most of his time was
spent tending the lawns and
shrubbory rather than acting
as a. ghoul.

Pat Looney spent her summer
as a companion to one of the
Gabor sisters. She explained, “I
got the job by answering an ad
in the paper, I already had a
job as a waitress at a place'
where I had worked the sum-
mer before, and just Went to
answer the ad an impulse, when
I got to the house mentioned
in the ad and was waiting to be
interviewed, I noticed all these
photos of the Gabors. I remem-
ber thinking, ‘Gee, they must
know the Gabors.’ Was I sur-
prised when my employer turned
out to be Magda Gabol‘ GallucAl
oi.”

Pat‘s job was to be of general
assistance to Magda, who had
had a stroke and was afflicted
with aphasia, a condition in
which the language'taculties are
impaired. ,

“Imagin‘e feeling perpetuallyl
that you have a word on the
tip of your tongue, and you can
get some idea of what, aphasia
is like. For Mrs. Gallucci it was
worse since she spoke ﬁve lan»
guages tluently. Although she
has diniculty in speaking and
must train other parts of her
brain to take over the function

 

of speech, she can still under—

stand everything," Pat said.

She continued, “Because her
vocabulary was so limited, I
spent a good part of the sum-
mer playing charades or twenty
questions. Sometimes it would
take 20 minutes for me to un-
derstand what she Wanted.

“As a psych major, it was in-
teresting for me to see the re»
actions of both Mrs, Gallucci and
the family to this unusual
stress."

Jeff Burnham served as a
recreation director on the Pa-
Page Indian Reservation in
Arizona. This was one of the
ﬁrst years college students
were pemined to Work in di«
rect Contact with the Indians.
Jeﬁ explained his job, ”In the
summer there is absolutely noth-
ing for the Indian children to
do on the reservation. My job
was to plan and execute 3 rec-
reational program for all the
children of this tribe.

“This was really my ﬁrst work
with children, but by the second
week I had realized the needs
of the program Fulﬁlling them
was another in Er, for super-
vising the acti es of four or
ﬁve groups of children simulta-
neously demands the attention of
more than just one person. Al-
together, it was a very reward—
ing, but frustrating. summer,”

Other unusual jobs of Grin-
nell’s students included count.
ing cow heads, working in the
Up and Down Department of the
mit Cake Bakers of America,
being a ﬁreman on a railway,
serving as a garbage man, work-
ing as “Santa’s helper," and
blowing smoke through sewer
pipes to find leaks.
