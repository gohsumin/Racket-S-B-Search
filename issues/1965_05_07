Tuesday's Riot Spontaneous;
loggia Tortress' Breached

By Bob Hodieme

It started as an abortive fight Tues-
day night on north campus and grew
rapidly into spontaneous spring riot.

About 75 men “marched on” south
campus and at about 12:30 broke into
the loggia at the south loggia door.

The group milled aimlessly around
the doorway for 10 minutes making
short “penetrations" into the more mys-
terious reaches of the north end of the
loggia.

Someone finally turned out the lights
on the loggia ceiling and, with the bless-
ing of anonymity, the number of men
quickly swelled and the “breadth of
march" increased.

Soon there were about 150 men in the
loggia with perhaps as many more ob-
serving irom outside.

The rioters were much like the dog
who caught the car and didn’t know
what to do with it. “We’re here, so now
what?"

“Now what" was an attempt to get
the girls to leave the loggia. When it
appeared that only 40 or 50 would leave

 

9mm

of their own volition,
the rioters pushed an-
other twenty or so
outside.

With no leaders or
"established lines oi
communication,” th e
“riot" degenerated in-
to nothingness with
men standing self-cone
sciously in the loggia
with no place to go

loggia apprehensively measuring the
distance to the nearest ioggia door.

Student government, under the lead-
ership of Jerry Goddard, SGA presi-
dent, and Chris Peterson, aws Board
president, “moved in" about 1:00.
They gave the rioters a choice. They
could continue to “riot" with women'.
hours extended until 2:00 with no or
ganized riot at a later date or they
could break up Within 15 minutes and
have an organized riot some other
night. ‘

The rioters decided to go home.

Goddard said he decided to stop the
riot because “it was a disorganized riot
and we were protecting property and
people. It could have gotten out
hand." ,

Goddard went on to say that the “dif-
ference between this (the Tuesday riot)
and an organized riot was that at an
organized riot someone will take th.
responsibility."

Phone calls were made to north
campus warning the more intrepid
girls who had ventured north to com.
home for bed check.

By 1:45 the loggia was free of men
(with the exception of SGA and tho
5&1!) and most of the women we“
back in their respective halls. Chris
Peterson, AWS Board president, ro<
ported that there were no girlie miss-
ing during the bed check.

by Grinneli students Saturday,
May 15, over telephonic lecture
equipment at the college.

The program, tentatively sche<

The program will begin with a
half-hour talk by Bundy, presiden-

George Kahin, a professor of
Southeast Asian affairs at Cornell
University, will speak in opposi-

THE REAL RIOT

The Real Spring Riot fi-
nally came off —— or went

broken glass, tennis courii
dancing, and the “tradi-
tional activities." _

Kissinger. 0n the opposing panel
Will be Mary Wright, also an ex»
pert on the Far East, and Hans
Morgenthau, director of the pro-
gram for the study of American
foreign and military policy at the
University of Chicago.

According to Sam Barnn (his-
tory), the teach-in will have more
the flavor of an academic debate
than a confrontation.

Arrangements for- the Grinnell
hock-up were made by an informal
faculty committee comprising Bar-
on. Lynn Parsons (history), Ron-
ald Kurtz (anthropology), and Rob
art Haveman (economics).

Several campus organizations
will help pay the $150 telephone
bill for the teach-in. Those groups
that have already pledged support
are lRC, Yﬂung Democrats, and
Young Republicans. Faculty dona-
tions are also helping to pay for the
hook-up.

The teachrin is being sponsored
nationally by the Inter-University
Committee for a Public Hearing
on Viet Nam. Committee organiz-
ers include David Riesman, B. F.
Skinner, Robert Hutchins, Jerome
Frank, Kenneth Boulding, Albert
SzenteGyorgi, and others.

Police Nab Pro

A Grinnell College senior and a
town resident were apprehended
by town police after a night watch-
man at the quad alerted the police
to the presence of the two on the
laggia root Saturday, April 24.

The case was handled entirely
through town authorities. partially
because I non-student was in-
volved in the case, Dean of Men'
5. Eugene Thompson said.

The two were fined for disturb-
ing the peace. The college took no
action in the case.

In another case involving the
town pulch, B leblc freshman
was found guilty of a conduct vio‘
lotion by the men’s primary court
after he was apprehended by local

town, and later turned over to col-
lege authorities,

He was put on conduct probation
until the end of the semester and
Was lined $15, $10 of which was
suspended.

Local authorities took no action
in this case.

The case was novel for the men's
primary court in that the defend-
ant was charged with A violation
of the general conduct clause as
outlined in the preamble to the
men’s house rules rather than with
a violation oi a specific rule.

The court's decision was 4—1,
with the dissenting magistrate
claiming‘jhat the preamble should
be only . an introduction to the

 

lice for being inwxlutcdrin

house rules and that there was no

”semen.” u. .

wlers: Couri- Seni'ences Frosh

reason to believe it was intended
to be a catchall rule.

The majority opinion pointed out
that the Court had a right to rule
on what parts of the men's house
code were actual rules and that
the court had decided the pre-
amble need not be considered I
mere introduction.

The majority then went on to
state that certain actions of the
defendant were in violation of the
precepts of the preamble because
they tailed to show good judgment
and because they reflected blamv
ant irresponsibility. ~

There was a cancansus that this
case points up a need for legisla-
tion that would allow the court to
hear cases that involve off-cam-

 

pm- .violations.

Kansas City.

A New President?

It has been nearly 14 months since President
Howard Bowen quit his post at Grinnell to become
head of the University of Iowa in Iowa City.

1n those months, several rumors of the impending
selection of a ner president have proved unfounded.

Each passing month and each groundless rumor
make the no-president situation more discouraging to
members of the community of a highly thought-of col-
lege.

 

We realize that it must be a difficult task to find
a new president. Still. we would think that the trustees
and administrators could be farsighted enough to real-
ize that men like Howard Bowen are going to advance;
therefore a group of men should be under consideration
It all times for the presidency of the college.

Of course, if our view of the situation is naive and
superficial, it might be because we are not told many
of the facts. The secret meetings with presidential
prospectives continue, but the students never find out
about them because “the privacy of the candidates
must be protected."

A 1900 editorial in the 5&3 noted, “While the stu—,
dents are not qualified to select a man for president,

Shades of Gray
Showing Your True Color

By Carl Otis Gray

it’s spring! Anyone who hasn’t noticed it
should take care to note the rich green car-
peted campus and the tawny tan tapering legs
that are beginning to grace the sun deck on
Main. the tennis courts, the Forum floor, and
all those other intimate niches that the campus
has to provide. This of course, is nothing new;
for years a coppery coat of skin has been the
sign of healthy clean living people of the Pepsi
generation. Now putting aside all denials oi ra-
Cial chauvinism, I find this seasonal phenome-
non highly significant as a point of departure
in an investigation of certain psychological
trends.

Okay, let's start with Man-Tan. In accord-
ance with all the principles laid down by Vance
Packard and David Ogilvy, ManATan is a suc-
cess. Man-Tan is virility. It promises the
rugged, ruddy complexion that marks lumber.
jacks and steel driving men; it promises the
allure and excitement that was previously rer
served for life guards and movie stars. Minutes
irom the everyday "city White,” it can assure
its users of a Florida tan that makes the sec-
ond requirement of “tall, dark, and handsome"
available to everyone from coal miners io oi-
t'ico clerks. There's something overwhelmingly
male about darkness, something strong and at-
tractive.

Then, at course, there's Coppcnonc, This
has an appeal to the young ladies. It promises
that sun»ravished cupric hue that complements

femininity with the “fresh, glad to be alive”
look.

But both of these have a mass appeal calel‘A
ing to the middle class ideal; it's Bain de Soleil
that truly captures the upper class eye. It prom-
ises no less than a ”love alfair with the sun."
No doubt, such an affair would he momentous
even for the most frigid of women — the more
thought of it arouses torrid passions. But such
an undertaking (so to speak) implies a certain
decadence that only Wealth could ever achieve.
Indeed, the golden girls oi this generation are
searching for new thrills and excitement; it
appears that anything under the sun is fair
game. The erotic overtones of a suntan seem to
be getting too hot to handle. .

The suntan worth a mi ion dollars is no
longer a mere advertising cliche but the harsh
reality of John Howard Griffith. 50 when Mr.
Griffith says. “Black Like Me," he does not
strike a discordant note in the ears of Anglo-
Saxia; he merely points out the advantages of
a temporary tonal change. All this is. of course.
in harmony with summer shades. So now, not
only are mns masculine, feminine, and erotic
perlections, but they are financially rewarding.
One can only assume that to have a tan in
America is to have the best of all possible
worlds. This is how America views it accord-
ing to all the available mass media, and yet we
wonder how the black supremacists get that
way. After all, the blacker the berry, the
sweeter the lece!

 

Memphis, ‘Place of Good Abode,‘

 

and their judgment in regard to such a selection could
be questioned, no one doubts that they thoroughly ap->
preciate the task that was before the trustees to find a-
man to take up the work where president Gates leaves
i.t" (As an interesting sldelight, the man whom the
trustees had selected and for whose selection the S&Bi
was praising the trustees in the editorial never took
over the presidency of the college, and Grinnell went
from 1900 to 1902 with an acting president. The col-
lege has also had acting presidents from 1884 to 1887,
1954 to 1955, and 1964 to present.)

Students of 1965 probably wouldn’t take such a
dim View of their abilities for helping choose a newi
president; but since we weren't asked to help, we would i
simply remind the trustees and administration that
taking 14 months or more to select a new president
looks more like desperation than deliberation

Memphis. Tennessee: the name
“Place of Good Abode.”
The billboards point out its repu-
tation as the cleanest city in the,
nation, and the Chamber of Com-
merce spends thousands of dollars
every year on a carnival to pro-
mote Memphis as the ”Cotton
Capital." White Memphis prides,
herself on her reputation as the
most liberal and “peaceful” city
in the South.

But there is another Memphis.
one that most Memphians never
see, or notice. Gradually. l have
come to sec Memphis as the "Com-
placent City." or rather. as two
complacent ciiics. The Place of
Good Abode is a city or white pet»;
ple. Their lite is, at all times, quite .
far removed from that of thei

Murphy Feels Enrollment Jump
Would Spread Grinnell Too Thin

To the: Editor:

This letter is in response to the
administration's recent announce
ment that enrollment at Grinnell
will be expanded by approximately
150 students as soon as new dor-
mitory space can be provided. The
proposed enrollment increase
seems to me unjustified and un-
wisc tor the tollowing reasons:

First, and most obviously, the ex-
pansion could lead to an unfortu-
nate overcrowding of union. -
brury, and auditorium faCili as.

Second, due to a relatively un~
do ized iullsiime teaching staii,
many classes at Grinnell are un-
desirably large. An increase in
enrollment without substantial ad-
ditions to the faculty can only re»
suit in the deterioration oi an al-
ready unsatisiactory situation.

Third. the proposed enrollment
increase is completely unjustiiied
iroin a standpoint oi easing ad~
missions pressures. At present the
college accepts tor admission he-
tueen one hali and two thirds oi
those students who apply; the pro.
per course for Grinnell would
seem to lie in the direction or
attracting more outstanding ap-
plicants, not in accepting a higher
proportion of the inadequate num-
ber oi students who are now ap-
plying,

Fourth, enrollment increases are
lilV their nature irrevocable. while
i is
Liberal Arts exams, revise curricu-
la and alter calendars, a new dor-
mitory, once completed, has to he

filled, To commit Grinneil to a-

possible to abolish Junior-

 

nccessarily permanent enrollment
increase at a time when we are
without a president may restrict
unduly our new president's tree
doin to pursue policies he ieels in
the best interests or the college.
in sum, I am suggesting that a
policy oi expanding enrollment
could prevent Grinnell irom
achieving what has thus tar prov.
en to be the highly elusive goal
ot academic excellence. In view oi
this tact, I otter the tollowing
proposal tor consideration by the
administration:

i. Present plans to increase en»

rolinient to be abandoned.

ii. Funds that are now intend-
ed ior the construction oi a
new women’s dormitory be die
rected instead to the pro~
curement of additional iacul.
ty members.

The preceding arguments and!

proposal are based on the conten-
tion that providing an excellent ed—
ucation ior 1,150 students is more

important than providing a good,

education for 1,300 students. 1
sincerely hope the administration
will reply publicly to this letter,
stating explicitly why a policy of
increasing enrollment is more pru~

dent than the proposal outlined

above.

Labor Organization leader Blanchard

Speaks at ‘Student

By Don Winney

What may be another Grin-
nell tradition, the student-less
coffee hour, was held Wednes-
day afternoon in South Lounge
Three students and th0 re
porters gathered to hear David
5. Blanchard, deputy director
of the Washington, D, C
branch of the lLO (lnternatio
a1 Labor Organization.) The dis-
cussion was sponsored by IRC
and the pre-law club.

”Spring fever” was Vander-
pool's explanation for the turn—
out that was a little less than
normall But one —-namely this:

Still, Mr. Blanohard wasi
gracious as he outlined the his
tory and goals of the ILO. l‘The
1L0," he said, “can provide
a better atmosphere for inter-
national understandings on cer-
tain limited matters, and as
a result, certain obligations be-
tween nations have grown
up."

The ”.0, he explained, was
an outgrowth of the Versailles
Treaty. Founded in 1919, the
ILO tried to establish an inter
national labor code to deal
with working conditions. Child
labor, and labor-managerial
abuses. Recognizing die need
for cooperative action to pre-
vent social unrest, the ILO first
concentrated in the industrial
nations, where labor conditions
often fed political turmoil.
Former Secretary of Labor
James Mitchell has Called the
ILO of this period “one of the
strongest weapons against coma
munist actions and ideas.”

Today, affiliated with the UN,
the 11.0 is increasingly con—

.cerned with building the econ-
omies of underdeveloped coun-
tries. Operating on a {orty mil-
lion dollar budget, one quarter

; Grinnellians View Modern Monas

By David Dillon

' “All of us left Conception
with a firm conviction that a
new priesthood has risen up in
American Catholicism.” This
comment by Paul Kuntz (phil-
osophy) aptly sums up the im~
pressions oi the ten Philosophy
Club members who, along with
Kuntz, visited Conception Ab-
bey and Seminary, a Benedic~
tine monastery and college
near Maryville, Missouri, Sat-
urday and Sunday, April 24th
and 25th.

Because F ath e r Gabriel
Franks ol' Conceptlm was un-
able to come to Grinneli to
speak on the philosophy of
Aquinas, the ten students left
Grinnell Saturday morning, ar-
riving at Conception in mid-ai-
ternoon. These included: Phyl-
is Lamb, Judy Johnson, Elaine
Cook, Martha Goodman, Ken
Adelman, David Dillon, Bob
Barrow, Bob Calltwell, Ron
Lane, and Don Bogue, as well
as Kuntz,

After their reception at theE

guest house of the Benedictine
Sisters of Clyde, they drove to
the seminary, meeting Father
Gabriel and a number of stu—
dents in the candy shop—an
informal union where Seminal“
ians may gather for refresh—
ments. Our hosts were college
students much like Ourselves,
participating in a fourryear lib-
eral arts undergraduate pro-
gram with a major in philos-
ophy. Following this, they plan

SPALDlNG GOLF BALLS

 

to complete another four
years of graduate study in
theology, after which they will
be ordained.

Father Gabriel discussed
“Thomas Aquinas and the Mod-
ern World,” Saturday after—
noon, He reminded his audience
that Christian philosophy in the
ancient and early medieval
worlds had followed the dual-
istic Concepts of Plato and his
ﬁo‘llower Plotinus, There was a
drastic division between a
man's physical body and his im-
mortal spirit. An early hymn
referred to the body as a “pris<
on” from which to escape. St
Augustine wrote of a rational
mind within a mortal body.
This point of view, which p
meated Benedictine monastic-
ism, ran counter to early Jew-
ish belief and the Christian con-
viction that me Son of God was
incarnated as a complete hu—
man being. Yet this dualism
still persisted, and is reflected
in such existentiallst works as
Sartre‘s Nausea and in the con-
cept oi pDSiLivlsm—the belief

,that all phenomena may be ex-

pressed in material or quantita
tive terms.

Thomas, however, affirmed
that the body and soul were of
one substance, although the
spirit was immortal. The ma-
terial world was good—some-
thing not to be escaped, but to
be embraced, This concept of
essential unity in the universe

tic Catholicism

and perhaps Whitehead—«Father
Gabriel believed to be the only
tenable viewpoints in the face
of modern technology.

The question was raised as
to whether Thomas or Teilhard
dc Chairdm could properly
c o m bin e philosophical and
scientific language. More gen—
erally, can concepts such as
aesthetic beauty and moral
goodness, usmg different scales
of measuremeni, be correlated?
Dr. Manly, a colleague of Fa-
ther Gabriel's, took pains to
demonstrate Thomas’ separa-
tion of philosophy and science
as specilic subjects, although
he was willing to affirm along
with Father Gabriel the concept
of “unity in diversity.”

The lecture and discussion
were followed by Mass in the
monastery church, an example
or the Romanesque revival.
The Mass was carried out in
concelebration; that is, several
priests represented the con-
gregation in accepting the sac
rament. Also noteworthy were
the many hymns and responses
in English,

Aboriginal Music
Topic of lecture

By Sue Barquist
Dr. Richard A. Waterman, an
ethnomusicologist at Wayne State
University, recently gave a lec-
ture entitled “Music in the Life of

the Australian Aborigine."
Dr. Waterman is both a distin-
guished anthropologist and profes-
sional musician (as amply demon-

strated in a Langan basement jam.

session with the jug band).

Waterman said that music's
main function for aborigine is to
hold the society on its own par
ticular path of life. The music life
cycle begins with women’s cert!»
monial wailing at birth. followed
by children's songs of the same
sort. Children sing when playing
games, etc. These songs teach chil-
dren about their environment and
help them learn to speak.

As the child begins to observe
the ceremonies of the group he be-
comes familiar with Karma songs.
These simple songs are history
and religious lessons, as they are
about hunting, ancestors, and cus-
toms.

Another group or songs includes
those song for pure entertainment
purposes by the bachelors in the
group. They are simple and ac-
companied by much clowning.

Other categories include men's
sacred songs and women’s wailing
rind general, multipurpose. magi-
cal chants.

The entire audience felt an im»
mediate admiration for the abori-
gine when Waterman explained
that planning ahead is looked up-
on as wrong trom their ethical
Viewpoint. They do not grow or
store food and do not even build
shelters for the wet season until
alter it has started to rain.

As the spring sports season heads into the home stretch,
the Pioneer golf team looks like the best bet to bring a con-
ference crown to Grinnell. After an opening loss to Iowa
State 61/2 - 8V2, the linksmen have whipped off six straight
victories, including five conference wins.

The golf team’s one non-conference win was over Drake
141/2-Vr. The list of conference victims includes Monmouth
14V2-l/2, Coe 131/2-1V2, Beloit 16-8, and Carleton 9-6. The Pio-
neers also avenged, on Tuesday, their one defeat of last year
with an 11-4 win over Cornell.

The last four matches for the Pioneers that were played
here on Friday, Saturday, and Tuesday give a good picture
of the team.

On Friday the Pioneers beat Beloit 16-8. In the individual
competition three golferSADave Sellergren, Ted Risser, and
Dave Shellenbargerawon while Eric Miller tied. In the 2-man
best ball competition Sellergren and Risser also won their
match.

On Saturday the Pioneers had a big triangular meet with
Drake and Carleton. Against Drake all five Grinnell golfers
—Risser, Sellergren, Mike Miller, Eric Miller, and Jeff Kohl-
man—notched victories in the rout. Risser, Sellergren, and
Mike Miller also won in the match with Carleton as the
Pioneers ran away with the meet victory. In this meet Kisser
also took medalist honors with a 70 While Sellergren and
Mike Miller both had 723.

On Tuesday the golfers had a match with Cornell and
whipped them easily. Risser, Sellergren, Eric Miller, and
Dave Shellenbarger all won in this meet.

Among the six golfers on the team, three are now unde-
feated and only one, the sixth man on the team, is under .500
in dual meet competition. The three undefeated linksmen
are number one man Ted Risser with a 5-0-2 record, number
two man Dave Sellergren with a 7-0 record and number

'five man Dave Shellenbarger
with a 5-0 record.

Number three man Mike
Miller and number four man
Eric Miller have 43 and 4-2
records respectively. .1 e ff
Kohlman, ,,who shares the
number five spot with Shellen-
barger, has a 1-2 record.

The golfers will finish
their season with the confer-
ence meet at Knox next week-
end. I do not want to put a
jinx on the team by predicting
a victory. But the fact is that
it will take a minor miracle
to keep this team from fin-
ishing near the top in the
standings.

As coach Merrill J archow of
Carleton said after the Pio-
neers snapped his team's three
match Winning streak: “Grin
nell will be the team to beat
in the conference meet.”

Nelmen Beat Ripon,
lose to luwrence

The Grinnell varsity tennis
team was on the tennis courts
from 9:00 am. until 6:30 p.m. last
Saturday. The Pioneers met both
Ripnn and Lawrence on Grinnell'l
courts.

Ripon was supposed to he the
tougher oi the two schools, but the
Pioneers won four of six singles
matches and two of three doubler
to win 6-3.

Winning for the Pioneers were
Greenfield (No. 3). Hicks (No. 4)
Lovell (No. 5) and Kinsey (No, a).
Grinnell's second doubles team of
Clymer and Greenfield, a confer-
ence title threat, won in three sets
as did the third doubles team of
Lovell and Hortonr Clymer and
Greenfield have not lost a doubles
match since the season opener at
Carleton.

The afternoon match against
Lawrence proved tougher on the
Pioneers. Grinnell managed to will
only one singles match outright.

Clymer (No. 2) won 6-1, M, 64.
Mike Greenfield, playing his sec-
ond marathon match of the day,
agreed to terminate play after two
sets in order to begin doubles play.
Greenfield Won the ﬁrst set 11-9,
but lost the second set 7,9,

In doubles, the Pioneers almost
swept Ripon. Clymer and Green-
iield won again, as did Horton and
Lovell in three sets. But Shannon
and Hicks, playing No. l doubles.
were unable to defeat their Ripon
opponents, despite a victory in the
first set.

The ﬁnal score DI the Lawrence
contest was Lawrence 51/2, Grin-
nell 3I/2.

The netmen are playing at Belolt
today. If they continue to play
good tennis, they should have lit-
tle trouble with Beloit. The Pio-
neers have one more match be-
fore the conference match. On
Monday, the netmen entertain
Iowa State on the Grinnell courts.
ISU is favored.
