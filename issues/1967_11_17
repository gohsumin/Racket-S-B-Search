"MEET THEM AT THEIR OWN LEVEL"

COEDS SLOW
TO REPEL
INVADERS

By DEBBIE GENTRY

Mears, Cleveland, Haines and
Read dormitories had, reports
say, from five to twelve male
visitors Saturday night long af-
ter permitted visiting hours.

It all apparently began at
about 11:30 on Moars second,
where one of the men walked
unannounced into a room, sur.
prising a girl in bed. He asked
where room 450 was, and then
left. She leaped out of bed and
put on her bathrobe.

The male visitors returned a
few minutes later, a witness
said. The girl shouted for them
to leave.

They went to Cleveland, where
they ran up to the second and
third floors. One girl who was
having a crazy foam (like light
shaving cream; it is used for
play) party with a friend in
the bathroom said she heard
their voices.

“We thought it was just an
illegal," the Cleveland girl
added, “and we started gig.

gling, but then one of them came

into the bathroom, and grabbed
my friend who was only wear-
ing pajama tops and panties,
and said: ‘Give me a kiss.’

“She was fighting him off and
I was hitting him and trying
to shut the door on him, All
sorts of people came running
out of their rooms and pan-
icked. Someone ran downstairs
to try and fetch Steve Aldrich,
the Resident Advisor’s hus-
hand."

Meanwhile, another girl, who
had been giving a team, lett
her room to discover the ma
son tor the screams coming
from the bathroom.

A witness said: “She was

Craig Allin, program director
at the unaired college radio sta-
tlou, submitted his resignation
to station manager Babnk Ar—
majani "litesday.

Allin, one of the founders of
this most recent attempt to es-
tablish radio at Gl‘innell, cited
lack of time as one reason for
his resignation. He also stated
that the “administration is
guilty of breaking faith” with
the staff of the radio station.

Station manager Armajalli
elaborated on the significance
of “breaking faith." Tile stu-
dents were to establish a staff,
apply for a license, and submit
requests and plans to the ad—
ministration for equipment and

a studio. “We have a staff, and
we have done our part of get-
ting the license, but the equip-
ment we wanted has been slow
in arriving, and the studio is
only now being started," ex~
plained Armajani,

Mr. Walden told the radio
station staff that the facilities,
to be located in the northwest
corner of Darby Gym, should
be completed by December 1K.
The station hopes to be on the
air the first day of second so-
master.

The radio station will make
a progress report to the stu-
dents of the college at an open
Senate meeting Tuesday at 7
p.m. in ARI-l auditorium.

very angry, and tearcup threat-
eningly in hand, ordered them
to get out. One of them wrestled
with her, she broke loose and
would have thrown the cup at
him, but it was her favorite,"

They were chased by the girls
out of Cleveland and ran into
lfaines.

By this time there were only
three oi them. A girl on Hail-res
second stated; “I was sitting
on the bed in my underwear
knitting when my bedroom door
opened and there was this guy
standing there.

" ‘Oh, excuse mei’ he said
and closed it. Then a second
guy opened the doorl l shouted,
'Get out of herel‘

“ ‘Do I have to?’ he asked.
'Of course you do‘ I answered,
and shut the door and held it,”

These were not high school
kids, but looked like college
students, she added.

Myrna Aldrich, resident ad-
visor of Cleveland said that
there was no substantial evi-
dence as to who they were.

“But," she concluded “they
were here and now they're
gone.”

Back in l-laines second bath-
room, ono of the more adven-
turous types was rattling the
stalls.

A girl told me: “A guy
peered over the toilet door. I
hit him over the head and
shouted ‘Wllo the hell do you
think you are? Get the hell out
of herel’

(“My mother once told me
that you have to meet them
at their own level and talk to
them in their own language,”
she later confided to her res—
ident advisor, Suzi Argenti.)

“My roommate, trapped in the
shower, whispered, ‘Don’t leave
me, Don’t leave me.’ She
chased him out of the bath-
room.”

Read second was the next and
last.

“All of a sudden I heard
mens’ voices laughing and shout-
ing,” a girl stated, “I shut the
door and they left,”

But they came back! Half an
hour later a Read second girl
was in the shower when a
man’s head and hands appeared
under the door of her shower
stall.

“I heard frantic screams
from the bathroom," her neigh-
bor said, ‘It was really fright-
ening. I ran to help my friend
and stepped on some glass from
a broken bottle dropped in
fright by one of the boys."

Recalling reports of the inci-
delit later, a Loose girl mused:

”Pity they didn't get as far
as Loose.“

(Ed, note: The followlngis an

HOW AMERICANS
CAN VOTE FOR LOVE

By ED HOFFMANS

A genuinely free electoral
process incorporates a basical-
ly nonviolent idea: that ballot:

are superior to bullets for re-
solving disputes among men and
nations.

. . . American ballots with
names like .1 n hn s on, Nixon,
Reagan, Romney or Gavin on
them are unlikely to stop the
bullets currently being used to
resolve the Vietnam dispute, In
other words, the present kind
of American ballot is incapable
of performing its natural func<
tion.

Hence the reform of Ameri-
can electoral politics calls for
the adoption of a new kind of
ballot. Impersonal ballots bear-
ing the names of politicians
who falsely claim to represent
our best interests must give way
to personalized ballots with tho
names of people we can trust.

And what could be more per«
sonalized than a ballot with tho
voter’s own name and signa.
ture? Draft cards should be the
ballots for our new electoral
system.

Electoral systems also requlu
voting booths for the deposit of
ballots. Federal marshails' of-
fices and in d u c ti o n centers
should be the voting booths of
our new electoral politics.

An electoral process features
the deposit of a ballot in a
voting booth, The new process
will work the same way. fea<
turing the deposit of a citizen’s
draft card in a Federal mar-
shalls' office or induction center.

Our new electoral process
would produce four benefits.

Firstly, draft card returner!

Editorials . . .

THIS IS NOT AN EDITORIAL

This is not an editorial. If you were expecting the son's analy-
sis of, and pronouncements on, a critical issue facing the campus
today, I’m sorry.

There were quite a few things to write about this week. Grin-
hell was Visited by a “new politician" and a “radical paciﬁst,"
the radio station is having a hard time getting on the air, and
North Campus men can‘t decide whether their biggest enemy is
the Dean of Men or themselves.

My chief cause of concern, and the reason that there is no
editorial this week, is the problem of objectivity. Basic to any edi-

torial policy must be an objective and objectivity. My objective
is simple: I wish to see students have the greatest opportunity to
live and learn, academically and otherwise, during their {our
years at Grinnell. I am sure that this objective does not differ
greatly from the wishes of the faculty and administration, but the
speciﬁc methods to foster this opportunity will. ii I am to per-
suade anyone that my method is better than theirs, I must be Ob‘
ijective. Shouting, demonstrating, and poking fun may be enjoy-
able and sotisiying pastimes, but they will not convince anyone
or anything.

One of the most dangerous imitators of objectivity is the edi-
mrial plural, If you read "the 5&3 feels that. r . r” you will prob-
ably think about the problem a bit when I sit down to write an
editorial, and I’m thinking about my girlfriend a thousand miles
away, an hourly tomorrow, and when I have to do my next laun-
dry, I don't feel too much like an editorial we. But if I write ”I
{eel that . . .” you are likely to think “goody for you, Ancona_" If
1 am going to honestly convince you ot anything, without beguiling
you into believing that I am speaking for a committee of leading
thinkers, it must be done by me, not "us.”

Getting a clear understanding of any issue on campus is diffi-
cult, and is further complicated by sixteen credits of courses (a
lubtle plug tor academic credit lor the editorship). Getting a grasp
an a major campus issue is dilficult for an administrator to do In
a year, much less is student —- whose main concern, unlike the
administrator, is not campus problems — for a weekly deadline.

The use of reason, which is basic to any argument, seems to
be missing quite olten from discussions on campus. When I pointed
up what seemed to me to b? contradictions in Edward Holtmans’
argument during his South Lounge speech Wednesday, he replied
that it was a paradox. I guess it you‘re “right” and you face a
contradiction, you’re allowed to Call it a paradox. But how can
you determine logically if you are right beiorc reaching the cou-
tradiction? You can't. And it you can‘t discuss your position log<
icaliy, you can’t discuss it at all.

1 have barely scratched the surface oi the problems surround.
lng editorial writing in a liberal arts college in a world or change,
but if yoll see an editorial next week, do me, and yourself, a iavor.
,Think less about “where [he 5&B stands” and more about why.

LETTERS TO
THE EDITOR

millilitlllliilliilllllilllilllllllillllllllllllllilillllillilllllllillillllll in:

To the Editor:

In the last issue of the 5&1!
Mr. Deblcki, of the Spanish De
partment. properly undertook
to correct some factual errors
made in u previous issue of
the paper. In doing so, how-
ever, he seems to have com—
mitted an error of his own.
He wrote: “Emphasis in the
course (Humanities) is on Ilt~
erary analysis in depth through
the irequent writing or papers
which are thoroughly criticized
by the instructor, and through
conferences.“

But the purpose of the Hu-
manities course is not “Empha-
sis on literary analysis." In
1963 Mr, Dehicki himself was
on the committee which pre-
pared 8 “manual for instruc-
tors" in the Humanities; in that
manual appears "A Rationale
for Grinnell's Course in the
Humanities". There, on p. a,
the manual states:

The course has a twofold
purpose: 1) to introduce a
student to humanistic works
with which an educated per-
son should be acquainted;
and 2) to train him in the
skills necessary to relevant
appreciation and use oi the
great creative works of men.

The new report on curriculum
currently under consideration
lists the purposes of the Hu-
manities course as lour in num-
ber; they are substantially the
same as the two listed in the
manual whi ch Mr. Debicki
helped to prepare.

It would be unfortunate if
the Humanities were ever re
duced to the status of being
merely a course in "literary
appreciatlon", like “chemistry
appreciation” or "physics ap<
preciatlon" and other such
courses in science lor non-
majors. The idea of a non-
majnr in Humanities is direct-
ly counter to the aim of a
liberal arts college.

ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

By Nei Fischer,
MEMO

T0: Ron Miller, Vietnam Committee, GSM (et 31.)
FROM: Neil Fischer, 5&3

SUBJECT: Is there a Vietnam petition or isn’t there a Vietnam
petition or where in hell is the Vietnam petition or whatever
happened to the Vietnam petition, anyway?

“I’m copplng out."

That, Mr. Miller, is what you told me a few minutes ago after
I saw you sit through a tworhour discussion with an Iowa protessot
who just turned in his draft card.

I believe you, Mr. Miller, and I think you ought to he blasted
this week. ‘

i wanted to turn this columns garish little scarohlight on po<
lin‘cal animals _ democratic and republican — at Grimell in this
issue, but I’m going to turn it on you instead.

Two and o hail weeks ago you, Mr. Miller — in the midst
of a long forgotten Convocation and long before a lengthy mid-
sem break — fired up this campus to sign an anti-war petition
bombasting a war “immoral in its useless loss of lives.”

You were very concerned, Mr. Miller, about the precise syn.
tax or your sentences. 1 made a mistake in writing about your pe.

titiorl, Mr. Miller; I called the War “immoral and a useless loss
of lives."

You seemed so genuinely concerned for your petition that the
sail; ran a special boxed correction pointing out the mistake, it
was a little change, Mr. Miller, but I was happy to make it for
you because I thought you were genuinely devoted to your causal

I tried to give you more coverage in the 5&3 than any othal
convocation event I made sure you got your picture in the paper,
Mr. Miller. I saw to it that the Des Moines newspapers and wire
services got stories about you, Mr. Miller, and about your petition
and your Vietnam Committee and your GSM.

i signed your petition, Mr. Miller.

Forty percent of the student body signed your petition,
Mr. Miller. Ashley Montagu signed it, Mr. Miller; so did Mar- ,
tin Luther King.

A nice lady from The New York Times even interviewed you.
Mr. Miller.
Mr. Miller, you told me Lyndon Johnson would he sent a copy,

of the petition . . t and Dean Rusk and Rockefeller and a whole
lot of other people.

You told me, Mr. Miller, that if I paid for it I could send coplel
to my congressmen at home.

What will you write my congressmen now, Mr. Miller? Will
you tell them that “about a month ago less than hall of Ihe
students at a tiny, isolated college bus stop signed a petition?"
Is that what you‘ll say in the letter you’ve been drafting for
two and a half weeks, Mr. Miller?

That’s old news. Mr. Miller.

If you had sent it out when it was fresh, Mr. Miller, tl
might have meant something. What does it mean now, Mr.
Miller?

You told me that some of the signatures were falsified and
some of the names non-existent. You told me you had to check
them, Mr. Miller.

Does it take you and your committee — you, who lired up al~
most half the campus in a week — [Wu and a half weeks and more
on check twenty potentially-false signatures? Twenty, by your own
estimate, Mr. Millerr

Does it take two and a half weeks and more to make a public
announcement of how many signatures you got, Mn Miller? well.
does it?

Does it take you that long to type them out and write a letter
giving background on your petition?

What, in fact, have you been doing with the Vietnamese peti-
tion since October when it was signed? It is now the middle Of
November, Mr. Miller,

I have seen you in the Forum gleefully poring over yuurrpetl-
tion on several occasions since convocation. l have asked you,
several times, for a breakdown of the signatures, Mr. Miller.

Mr. Miller, I think you have done all of those who signed
that petition, all of those who considered it everywhere ironl
Main Lounge to the Wednesday night Senate meetings, all ot
those who thought about it and publicized it and wrote home
about it a vast injustice.

And this week, Mr. Miller, I want you to do something about
it.

I only have one more rhetorical question for you, Mr. Millenl
Are you going to send copies of those signatures out or are you
going to use them for notebook paper?

I hope you take this column personally, Mr. Miller, I hope
people come up to you and ask you about the petition. I hope
people get angry about it, Mr. Miller, and about you.

And then I hope you crawl out of your lethargy and print thou
signatures. Mr. Miller. And 1 hope it isn’t too late.

ONE DEGREE OUT OF
THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY
or
LIFE IS DERTAINLY
UNDEBTMN

EBY PAUL JONES

Alter two months at writing about creativity and rule philoso-
phy, i ﬁnd that now 1 have nothing more to say. As tar as I’m
concerned, 1 have asked all at the questions and given as raw of
the answers as I intended. This is the end.

But in all honesty, there is one more thing that has to be sald,
That is: [don’t know what‘l'm talking about, It's a iairly shocking
realization, but it’s true. i really don’t know anymore it I'm saying
what needs to be said. I suppose that l should explain. Sitting at
the Longhorn the other night, I realized that when 1 leave here, 1
will not leave with an education or “education” as such, but
rather with I Grinnell education, something radically different
from "education."

Granted, Grinnell is judged by external sources to be one of
the “best" liberal arts schools in the country, but merely by vir-
tue of its being a ”school", it is not education in general. What it
does present ls a fairly specific mode of a certain kind One con-
clusion to draw from this is that I don’t really know what “edu-
cation" as such is; I can not get outside of my conditioned way of
looking at things.

But another conclusion, and a far more devastating one in
terms of the purpose of my writing a column in the newspaper, in
that, having once considered creativity and rule philosophy to be
the most important and allrembracing concepts about which 1
could talk, 1 now don't know if that’s true anymore, What 1 don't
know is the answer to the question “What is there left to know?"
That is, what is there to know which I don‘t already know about
knowing?

Don't mistake this for a claim to omniscience, it is exactly
the contrary, a claim to ignorance, and an ignorance which
is, to a large extent, fostered upon me by many sources:
parents, teachers. Grinnell, language, everything. To speak meta-
phorically, how many degrees, out at the iull circle of the three
hundred and sixty degrees of what there is to know, do i now
recognize? Maybe one degree at the whole circumierence. Arid l
doirt really know how to get outside at that one degree.

The ontortunate thing is that 1 know that I will ﬁght this con-
ditioning for the rest oi my life, and i don't kllow why i should
have to. What i am getting at, and it's an old horse to beat, is
that, yeah baby, Grinnell is narrow. But not just in the sense that
it’s llity miles tram Des Moines, l.e nowhere, but that it is thou-
sands and thousands oi miles from being what it should be, a liba
eral education, miles irom a sense that a liberal education is not
an end in itseli, but merely a steppingrstone to the future search
for usable knowledge, not just the acceptance oi what is now call<
ed knowledge.

A prolessor told me that what this realization has done ior
me IS to liberate me, not libcralize me. ln one sense this is true;
it has given me the opportunity to ilght like hell to get as tar
away from the ‘idea' or Grinnell education But telling me that I’m
liberated doesn't tell me a damned thing, actually. What am 1 free
to do now? l don't want to spend die rest oi my lile ﬁghting
against an idea, but rather ior ideas it my mode oi conditioning
will ever let me see beyond what i am now conditioned to see.

So 1 ask: is creativity a Worthwhile problem in the “real
world”? is rule philosophy in its broadest sense, i.e., ethics, is real
problem? i don’t. know anymore. Who does?

A STUDENT OPINION
SELF-IMPUSED SEDBEGATIDN?

NAME WlTHHELD BY REQUEST

Talking to Mr. Randall Morgan, Chicago Area Civil Rights
leader, at Encampment gave me some new insights. l preier to
remain anonymous because i want what i have to say to be judged
on its own merits, not on my personality. i am white.

I have noted increasing concern among both Negroes and
whites on campus over the increased membership in what 1 will
call the Negro subculture. This is a group of Negro students who
have “opted out” or the rest of Grillnell's society. They have
chosen to stay within their own group exclusively.

Wily is it distressing to the onlookers mentioned above that
this group prefers to eat together, walk together, talk together,
dance together, and generally spend time together exclusively?
This exclusion of the White world is self isolation with carelul
signs, rituals, slang, and other cultural elements. It is just as evil
a form of discrimination as that which these students probably
experience in reverse in their home towns.

Of Course, in saying all this, I realize that this Subculture is
not unique to Grinnell. It is the transplantation to this campus oi
the Negro subculture from which these people come. Neverthe-
less, its existence is not good, and there are several points which
were elucidated in encampment that we should remember.

We all recognize the background which is so important here.
The Negro in America is withdrawing into his group all over the
nation. This withdrawal is necessary partly tor the discovery ct
identity and self-respect. And, of course, we cannot expect a Negro
coming to Grinnell to drop out or what is probably the most im-
portant thing the American Negro is doing right now. We cannot
ask him to become white for eight semesters, Race betrayal is not
the answer.

Some people feel that the relatively Sudden growth of the Grin-
nell subculture (it has become an active force in the Negro com-
munity in less than a year) is due to the increased numbers of Nee
groes at Grinnell, 1 leel that it is more likely because oi the above
national movement.

There is some signiﬁcance in the greater number of Negroes
here. however The larger the number, the wider the variety nr
backgrounds. This variety makes it more likely a greater per-
centage ot Negroes here will come lrom highly prejudiced environ.
ments, will be persons careiully socialized in total segregation,
persons totally unpracticed in interacting with whites.

We must also keep in mind the courage it takes for a Negro
to come to a predominantly white school like Grinnell. There is
certainly less prejudice and discrimination here than in some
other parts of the nation, but the Negro knows he will encounter
prejudiced individuals here and will experience some discrimi-
nation. Aitending a Negro college is an emotionally easier way to
get a college degree. So, the white students here must remember
that Negroes, because of the nature of this country’s hypocrisy,
must enter Grinncll with apprehensions.

These apprehensions are not immediately dispelled by good
will. We operate on an artificial level here, and few of us quickly
reveal our true selves. When one drunk person reveals repressed
prejudice to a Negro, think tor a minute how quickly the Victim
would lorget all the many seemingly non-prejudiced contacts he
has had, One such incident suggests widespread repressions oi
the same kind to the person who is unsure how he will be treated
in the iirst place.

Such dISlllilsionment is possible because of the white commu-
nlty's failure to provide positive and concrete Ieaiiirmatlons or
our desire for a genuinely nah-prejudiced and non-racially-oriented
Grinnell society. Quiet acceptance or the nonrracial point oi view
leaves the unsure Negro, when conironted with very subtly-hidden
prejudice, manifested in situations when the barriers are down,
to assume this repressed prejudice is the dominant pattern,

It is not my purpose here to suggest how we, the white stu-
dents, can concretely reaffirm our commitment to an integrated
society at Grinnell. 1 leave suggestions to others. 1 reel, however,
that if we are aware that what we are doing now is not enough,
occasions to maniiest our feelings will arise, and this awareness
will lead to action.

PLAIIDITS FOR PANNWTT: GGLD STAR FOR RED BADGE

By JOHN WILES

The 196168 Grinnell Theatre
loason saw its first real suc<
less “with distinction" in the
recent Arena production of
laird Williamson's dramatic ad-
nptation of Stephen Crane’s
The Red Badge of Courage.
Very few critical bones need
be picked with this production,
which impressively combined
Icting, directing, and technical
Excellence into one of the most
creatively outstanding and af-
fecting works which have been
attempted in the Arena Theatre
In years.

To start with. some fair share
at credit must be apportioned
lo the property itself. William-
son has been supremely faith-
iul to Crane, although the ap
peal of this play certainly ex-
tends beyond simple faithful-
less.

Williamson’s adaptation of
trane's novel is ostensibly a
bare, roughly sketched transla-
tion of the story of the naive,
fdealistic youth Who grows in
character through his tragic
confrontation with the "blood
swollen god" of war. Super-
ficially, the script actually of-
fers little more tangible the-
atrical potential than that of a
limple dramatic reading.

The play is short, summarized
and abbreviated (the actual run-
ning length of the Grinneil pro-
duction was but a scant 45
minutes).

Yet Williamson, in transfer,
ring the essence of Crane’s
story from narrative to dra-
matic form, has decidedly ex-
panded the possibilities for the
telling of that story, and has
accordingly “opened up" the
story to anyone with sufficient
creativity to take advantage of
the new genre’s potential.

Williamson seems to offer a
clue to the work's production
possibilities in his extensive
Ind affecting use of the novel's
rich language and images, Hen~
ry Fleming, the young protag—
onist, is described early as an
eager-eyed youth who dreams
of “vague and bloody con-
flicts," and the'heroism which

he just as vaguely believes will
surely accompany them.

Having thus faithfully identi-
ﬂed the early Henry as a
dreamer, Williamson compounds
narrated references to “visions
of a thousandtongued fear;"
the soldiers' “mysterious frat-
emity;" and the "monster”
war — a "red animal" which
is personified in the imagina-
tion and frightened mind of
Henry.

Such language is clearly in.
dicative of the supernatural,
the psychological, the unreali
the abstract, the impressionis-
tic workings of the tormented
consciousness which is Henry’s
internal identity. The differences
between what drama can
“show" and what narrative can
“tell" of this, the real essence
of Crane’s story, seems to
point toward taking a relative
ly free theatrical rein in se
lecting the elements with which
to dramatize this adaptation.

Director Libby Pannwitt and
her crew proved themselves
quite adequate to the challenge.

In bringing the possibilities of
the script to theatrical reality,
Miss Pannwitt apparently took
up much a similar directorial
interpretation, freely and cre-
atively capitalizing upon the
play’s symbols and imagery.

Realistic camp scenes and
characters' speeches throughout
the play were purposefully in-
terspersed with segments of
choral dialogue and symbolicals
1y choreographed actions. One
character Was made to dis
“realistically" on stage; a sim-
ple circle of eerie green light
was used to symbolize the body
of another, decaying dead sol-
dier.

in one scene, the company
of soldiers was realistically pre~
sented lounging at rest on the
countryside; in another, the
troops mechanically marched
in time (and almost in place),
betraying the weary boredom
of the troops continual move-
ment to no one place and for
no clear purpose in particular.
The effect of such combinations
of style and dramatic elements
was to confront the audience
at once with the stark reality
of war, and also with its ir»
rational incomprehensibility.

Two of the most effective
scenes of the play unmistakably
complemented each other
through just such purposeful
diversity. An early scene rep~
resents an actual dialogue be-
tween Henry and his mother,
revealing “realistically" the
youthful idealist, confident in
his soaring illusions, A later
scene found Henry alone and
separated after running away
from battle; nameless mem-
bers of the chorus besieged him
with taunts and ridicule for his
cowardice. The illusions of the
voices represented Henry’s own
thoughts and self-accusations,
the {armless fears which had,
ironically, become his hellish
reality.

Visual and auditory effects
were imaginatively and impres-
sively employed to support both
aspects of the play’s presenta-
tion. Lighting in many colors
and arrangements helped to tie

fine and contrast realistic and
abstract elements, Drums and
recorded music artificially un-
derscored moments of realistic,
climactic tension.

The set was simply and phys-
ically functional — in no way
really representative of ground,
yet extremely adaptable to both
realistic and a b s t r a c i movt.L
merits. Costumes suggested real
uniforms, while remaining. as
work shirts and jeans, in ef-
fect symbols in themselves.

Even the painting of the walls
of the theatre (the first Arena
production for which this has
ever been dared) was a credit
to the imaginative staging of
the play. Three walls were a
dark, somber gray; the back
wall, a blank, impersonal light
gray-blue. The audience thus
was at all times surrounded by
an environment which affect-
ingly contained and reflected
the play’s serious mood.

The cast itself was excellent
to a man. Virtually every actor
was believable in his role, and
contributed to a polished, co-
hesive, complementary sum of
performances.

Ned Benton was especially
excellent as Henry, conveying
with sensitivity and depth the
youthful dreamer's internal de-
velopment as catalyzed by the
battle‘s crises Benton remained
strong, from his initial boyish
characterization of the optimis-
tic, illusioned enlistee to his
more mature portrayal of the
ironic, disillusioned hero whose
war-weary “Damn. . .damn,.
damn, . . damn. . ." under-
cuts a moment of apparent
glory with a telling indictment
by one who more sadly and
wisely understands the real
pain and hell of war,

Benton was weakest as Hen-
ry in his most hysterical mo-
ments of near»madness; his
emoting seemed less natural
than consciously summoned,
and occasionally appeared to be
approaching a pitch of uncom-
fortable histr‘ionics. Such com-
paratively weak moments were
few, however, and did not ser-
iously undermine a generally
controlled and finely - charac-
terized performance.

All of the soldiers were Well-
played, and the cooperative in«
corporation of such group “bits"
as card-playing and good-ha.
tured needling were largely
responsible for giving the play

the realistic moments it needed,’

when it needed them.

Greg Wallance and Carter
Coleman were very good as
Henry's companions, Wilson and
Jim. Both defined their char~
acters convincingly, without
turning them into overly strong
characters who might have up-
staged the central protagonist.
Coleman's only disturbingly
awkward moment came, iron-
ically enough, after his “death”
as Jim.

The classic problem of how
to get a dead body off stage
was not Well handled, and the
exit of the corpse on his own
suddenly resurrected power was,
while not a serious fault within
the play, a minor irritation
which might more pleasingly
have been avoided.

Merritt Olsen injected a de«
Cidedly valuable element of
comic relief into the play with
his characterization of the
Wounded Soldier. With one dead
body and one seriously shocked,
near-hysterical character also
sharing the stage, it took dell-
cate handling on the part 0!
Olsen to keep his comic figure
from becoming irreparably ir-
reverent and annoyingly out of
place,

As it was, the scene became
a symbolic representation of
the incomprehensible juxtaposi-
tion of extremes in any war.
Henry was effectively framed
as the victim of such insanity—-
a tragic corpse on one side, a
senseless clown on the other.

Olsen’s only weak moment
was partially shared in this
sense by Benton. Not nearly
sufficient attention or signifi-
cance was given to the exchange
of the handkerchief, which ob-
viously was intended to he the
play's final, crucial symbol.
Henry’s conclusive moment of
truth and understanding was
thus unfortunately weakened by
this shortcoming of an earlier,
preparatory scene.

Dale Dreyfuss and Dennis
Wilson were excellent in much
smaller roles, giving credence
to the axiom that “there are
no small actors, just small
parts," Each took upon himself
the seemingly negligible, but
extremely relevant business of
making his unnamed character
seem nonetheless individually
distinct and real.

Bonnie Tinker, in much the
same manner, made her few
brief moments as Henry's moth»
er so thoroughly believable and
convincing that it was almost
too hard to accept her as
merely a nameless voice in the
chorus throughout the rest of
the play,

The chorus was expertly em-
ployed, with every member of
the cast at some time slipping
from finite characterization in-
to the function of a nameless
observot and commentator on
the futility and damnable waste
of war. Ricki Ravitts was par-
ticularly outstanding — as were
Dreyfuss, Wilson, and Miss
Tinker — in combining precis-
ion of vocal expression with
fluid, graceful physical move-
ment.

If any one of the play’s
numerous fine moments were
to be singled out for special
praise, it would unquestionably
have to be the abstract, sur-
realistic battle dance. Judy
Mendelsohn's choreography was
hypnotic and almost literally
frightening. She was given fine
support by a seemingly all-
stops-out employment of techni-
cal ingenuity which mixed pur—
ple, yellow. and threatening
melody to create a near-psyche-
delic impression of acute dan-
ger, fear, and death.

i-ienry Fleming’s futile ques-
tions of ”why?"; “What for?";
and "Don't we do all men can
do?" were never answered by
anyone in this play.

The play being true to Crane,
however, the questions could not
be answered; only me awful
truth might be guessed in the

final "damn" of Henry’s new
awareness.

Last year‘s War Without End
attacked Grinnell audiences with
essentially the same truth, and
with more than twice the the.
atrical effort. Mr. Crane, Mr,
Williamson, Miss Pannwin, and
all others responsible for The
Red Badge of Courage are to
be commended for hitting clos-
er home — on a smaller scale
but with just about twice the
effective coherency and organ-
ized creativity.

more skeptical when they find
out the truth."

He said, however, that Reag-
an has a “reasonable chance"
to be the Republican nominee
in 1968.

Unruh said he could see no
way of “dumping Johnson” as
the 1968 Democratic party norm
lnee unless LBJ himself stand]
aside.

“Gene McCarthy could win a
couple of primaries and cause
a lot of shouting at the Con—
vention," U n r u h suggested,
“But that’s about it."

The Speaker explained that
Johnson's war policy was en~
dorsed in California with the
significant and major defeat of
the San Francisco referendum
"especially when you consider
that San Francisco county is
the most liberal in California."

Unruh, a democrat and a
past president of the National
Conference of State Legislative’
Leaders. advanced argiments
for his brand of politics-what
he calls “Creative Federalism:"

He stated that; state legisla-
tures were the places to
“strengthen and preserve de-
mocracy as we know it,"

“Unfortunately,” he added,
“the Federal Government is
always looked to to solve the
problems. We should resist this
tendency to concentrate power
in one unit of the government
as this one'unit gives us just
one solution."

The essentials of the “New
Politics,” Unruh said, include
responding to the people and
their problems, recognizing no
pre-commitments, and not be
ing dominated by set ideology
or doctrine.

Closing his address to the
PPPE and Grinnell student an.
dience, Unruh called for an illu-
volvement in the political pro-
cess.

"Equip yourselves to do the
best job possible," he concluded.

observed that the processes may drop on instead. Leaves drop
off trees in the tall. tar example, because of the growth or an no-

SHOW INITIATIVE FUND USE

By LEE ARBETMAN,
INITIATIVE FUND
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN

Now in its second year of
operation, the Initiative Fund is
finally being used as It was
originally intended: to encour-
age uniqueness and creativity
in social planning.

Formation of the fund, which
was put Into operation in the
Fail or 1966, stemmed from a
desire on the part at the halls
to receive extra ﬁnancial old
when joining forces on a party,
and from the Senate's wish to
increase social interaction be
tween North and South Campus.

At that time it was decided
that the halls could apply to
the fund for inter-hall or hall-
taculty social gatherings. Ob-
iections raised were primarily
concerned with the {act that
halls were being unfairly co-
erced into multi-hall parties
which occasionally turned out
to be fiascoes.

This year, with a liberaliza-
tion of application criteria, most
requests for money have come
from groups of students inter-
ested in providing events open
to the entire campus. A few
examples of events either fully
or else in large part sponsored
by the fund include the Chess
game on Barber Plaza, the
BIi‘d»Bowl Hall, the GRAB (out-
door dance and sleep-out), the

In addition, the fund has
helped to defray the costs of
several ottcampus parties and
dinners tor students who are
tundless for social planning even
though they pay the same at.»

students.

Halls are still encouraged to
apply for help in ﬁnancing
their social projects (though
multi-hall planning is not I
requisite condition). But this
year the Initiative Fund ha-
been able to liberalize its cri—
terin enough to allow it to sup
port events which illustrate
creativity and uniqueness—two
glaring weaknesses in most hall
sponsored social affairs.

“galvanized" by the mere sug-
gestion that a fallout shelter
be built in the basement of the
new fine arts building then
under construction.

Last Sunday Nan Robertson,
of the Times Washington bu-
reau, was back at Grinnell to
discern—oi all things—“the na<
ture and extent of political and
social activism at Grinncll,
1967.”

Miss Robertsoniwho is also
researching activism at Harvr
ard, Berkeley, the University of
Texas, anrl the University oi
Wisconsin —interviewed SGA
president Ric MaCDOWell, AWS
board president Leida Schoggen,
5&3 editor Barry Ancona and
several other “student leaders”
chosen lor her by the college
Information Service.

She talked With members DI
the Grinnell Student Movement
(GSM) concerning anti-war sen-
timent on campus and inter.
v i e w e :1 several anthropology
majors on problems at Negro—

Grinnell.

Miss Robertson also attended
a dinner with officials of the

The Times reporter, present-

noted a change in the Grinnell
sonic-political climate since her

In 1962 she said she found
the campus “swept with rumor,
apprehension and discussion" at
peace tests, anti - war move-

An international relations club

1962, she said she got quotes
like this one:

“We are building up to ex-

assert our feelings and our in-
tellectual arguments in a more
public way."

”Grinnell College when I was

In other words, citizens would
ignore the current electoral
system that forces so many
voters to lie to their govern-
ment, and they would express
their opposition to violence and
hatred in a peaceful, loving,
and truthful manner that would
thoroughly contradict the gov-
ernment's lies and evasions.

Secondly, the new voting sys-
tem would allow many who
want withdrawals of American
troops from Vietnam to express
their choice directly, thus re-
introducing valid choice on ma»

American politcs.

Thirdly, listo-Zl-yearrolds who

citizens are already registered

an election.

(2) Voters do not have to wait

SUPER SEASON
$FOR FIGHTING FROSH

I By JEFF SCHECKTER

-r he a result of numerous
threats by the freshmen, a poi-
son pen letter and the plead-
ings of a beautiful cheerleader,
the story of the freshman
football team is now being re-
leted.
This year's squad is the only
, beaten and untied team in
life history of Grinnell fresh-
men football. 1n compiling this
0rd, the Pioneers defeated
Elimell 22-21, Knox 23-14, and
08 124).
A talk wlth Coach Pfitsch m.
ealed that at least 13 of the
1 players on the team are
ready to compete with the van
llty in the Midwest Conference.
The freshmen won their
ames on the strength of their
Ens, the querterbacking of
dry Johnson and the mining
of left halfback Roy Lewis.
“The two guards, Steve
ﬂutchlngs and Larry Grimm,
are two of the finest l have
vet coached,” said Coach
fitsch. They were backed by

Justin Natural Color Rufﬁan!

and Red-Wing Roots

Jim Edwards and Tom Cole,
two more excellent linemen.
Doug Lewis was outstanding
as an offensive center and the
tackles Karlan, Rose, Pope
and Hamilton were coming on
stronger with every game.

The ends, Gary Jones and
John Czerwinski, played very
well as both blockers and re«
ceivers. Gary Jones hauled in
three touchdowns and account.
ed for one/third of Grinnell’s
scoring.

Gary Johnson was excellent
in his quarterbacklng, both as
a signal-caller and as a player.
Gary passed for three touch-
downs and four extra points in
a three game season.

Roy Lewis was the work-
horse of the backfield, can-y.
ing the ball for four touch-
downs, and should be a poten<
tial All - Conference runner.
The remainder of the mnning
chores were ably performed by
Jim Spell and Bob Haythome.
both of whom were playing out
of normal positions.

The first two games were
played by a nervous and inex-
perienced team. Twice the
trash were forced to come from
behind in the fourth quarter to
win. The last game with Coo,
however, was quite different.
Despite the muddy field and
the cold weatller, Grinnell
scored the first time it had the
ball. Keeping on the ground,
Grinnell rolled to a 12—0 lead
at halftime, The mud grew
worse and the defense grew
better and Grinnell eventually
won the game after a scoreless
second half.

The 21 players on the team
will be welcomed next year by
the varsity. Many of this
year's starters are seniors.
Look for Jones, Johnson,
Grimm, Hutchings, and many
other irosh to be playing first
string on the Pioneer varsity
next season.

The Pioneers played a con-

would have difficulty Winning
