From Iowa cornﬁeld to lliel Jungle
Success Story of F armor 8&8 Editor

BOB HODlERNE, tonne. 5&3 editor. interviews a resident oi
Chicago's west side. Hodieine is now a war photographer in

Viei Nam.

Ed. notet The following report
was written by Henry Wilhelm
'68, a close friend of tanner
5&3 editor Bob Hodierne. Hi)-
diei-ne is now a war photograph-
er in Viet Nam.

By Henry Wilhelm

"We were walking across this
big open area (much like a valley
between mountains or jungle) and
from quite a ways up ahead two
machine guns (30 cal.) opened up
on us. The land we were on was
sloping up to a plateau where the
machine guns were and they were
quite distant from us. So the bul-
lets couldn’t get low enough

The above was taken from a
letter by Bob Hodierne, former

5&3 editor, who has temporarily
quit school to work as a war
photographer in Viet Nam. Short-
ly alter the conclusion of last sea
mester. Hudieme sold some stock
to buy a one way plane ticket,
told his parents that he was “go
mg to travel around," bought two
Nikon F cameras, and left for Sai-
gon by way or Hong Kong.

When he arrived in Hung Kong
he found that he could not be in
Viet Nam for longer than seven
days since at the time he was not
accredited by any “responsible
news organization." But he went
on anyway in the hope that he
would find someone to accredit
him otter he got there.

Hodierne wrote: “1' got to Sai-

gon late Monday night and went
to the UPI oﬂice ﬁrst thing Tues~
day morning. They were pleased
as hell to see me. They got me ac<
credited at once, are taking care

a place to stay. They also provide
me with all the lilm I can 1159.
Wednesday was my ﬁrst day on

New Dean Discusses Grinnell

By Ann Kirschner

Mrs. Alice Low, Grinnell's new
dean Ol’ women, is more interest-

ed in establishing a philosophy oil

living for the residence halls than
in putting emphasis on rules.

Mrs. Low teels that college stile
dents should continue to assume a
great deal of responsibility with-
in the hall system. however, she
also said in all interview last week
with an 5&3 Writer, “You cannot
put 500 girls in the Quad and not
have rules. There are some people
who might olherwise iniringe on
the freedom of others." Mrs. Low
said that a rule should be put into
ettect it a situation logically re-
quires it and if it also makes
sense in a longer-snge view.

Greater studenlrfaculty commu-
nication outside the classroom is
one of Mrs. LnW's main concerns.
Many or the taculty expressed in
terest last spring in having more
informal discussions with students.
Mrs. Low said, “This is a two-Way
street, but students must take the
initiatiVE.” She would like to see
groups of students interested in
having a particular discussion in-
Vlte professors to the hall lounges.
Mrs. Low feels that it is not the
number of Students involved that
would determine the success of
such a meeting, but how meaning-
iul it was to those who participat-
ed. She hopes that the discussions
will become more informal.

Mrs. Low has taken a special int
terest in the availability at more
academic and personal counseling.
Aside from the professional ser-
vices oiiered to students, Mrs.
Low will be meeting with the Bat-
tleboards to better prepare them
to deal with the problems they
might encounter in their capacity
of advisors.

in response to feelings expressed
last year by students about how
ing at greater say in determining
the curriculum, Mrs. Low feels

that the administration should be
‘willing to listen to suggestions and
iparticipate in profitable diSCIlS<
‘Sions. She Said that the students
must realize that Wllile they will
not be able to make the final de-
cisions, the administration should
be very interested in working
closely with them to determine the
feasibility of instituting courses
where interest has been shown and
also for explaining why certain
courses may not be given,

Mrs. Low was dean of women
tor the past six years at Central
Washington State College, Elicns-
berg, Washington. where she re-
ceived her master's degree. She
was an undergraduate at Eastern
Washington State College.

The “great parking lot contron
Versy" which stirred campus con-
cern last spring appears to be
solved.

in an interview with an 5&3
writer earlier this week President
Leggett said, “We're committed
to the idea that it we have park.
ing lots they will be on the cam-
pus ner. “l'v.” : ' would
not disturb campus greenery.

Leggett said he plans to ride a
bicycle this year and expressed
the hope that [acuity and stair
members would follow his exam-
ple in an eliort to mlieve the shorts
age at parking space.

The controversy arose last
spring when 3&6 employees be-
gan construction or a parking lot
in the grassy area across the railr
road tracks 1mm Burling Librarv.
A group or students protested the
action and staged a sitdown strike
on the construction site. The con-
troversy we : unsettled when

Credit-Fail Comesl'o Grinnell:
New Faculty Joins Old Guard

Accompanying the new laces on

innovation [or Grinnell, the credit-
iail grading system, Any Sopho-
more. junior or senior may elect
one course each semester under
the system, provided tha§>the
course is not a general graduation
requirement nor in the student’s
mayor iield. The hoped for result
is that cliemistrv nioiors will now
throng into medieval lit courses
and likewise that English majors
will avail themselves of the rigor
of the scientific method. The new
system of evaluation will replace
the conventional numerical grades
in the elected courses. It the
grade is “credit" it will not be in-
cluded in ﬁguring the student's
gradepoint average. it it is “fail"

House Cleaning»-

The Scarlet & Black is cleaning house. The de-
arture of the former editor calls for a reassessment of
.he S&B role. This reassessment cannot be completed
until the Board of Student Publications names its
choice for new editor. In the meantime, however, sev-
eral things seem clear.

First, the 5&3 should continue to be a radical
voice in the Grinnell community. It should not be
afraid to step on the toes of administration and faculty,
and it should also be prepared to step on student toes.
The 5&3 editor and his staff members have access to
more information about all aspects of the campus than
any other group or individual. They should be pre-
pared to use this information to expose weaknesses
and promote strength throughout the community

Second, the S&B should become a responsible
voice in the community. Muckraking is sometimes
necessary, but it can only be effective if the community
has confidence in the reliability and honesty of the
8&3. Too often in the past the 58:8 has found itself in
the role of the little boy who cried wolf. To overcome
this role, the 5&3 must strive for accuracy and techni-
cal strength, not sensationalism.

Finally, the 58:3 staff should not be a social
clique. Much about the nature of the S&B’s operation
tends to foster a tightly knit staff. Nevertheless, in so
far as it is technically feasible the S&B should be sup-

orted by a large staff of interested students. It is up
0 the S&B leadership to encourage widespread par-
ti ipation in the production of the paper; it is up to
the student body to be ready to spend time and effort
to make the S&B a strong voice in the community,

These three areas, radicalism, responsibility and
participation, seem from this viewpoint to be the most
vital concerns of the S&B in the semester ahead. They
have been sketched only broadly above. Hopefully,
circumstances will make it possible to expand on them
in the weeks to come. The first step must come Sunday
night at the first staff meeting of the year. The im-
portance of this meeting and the evidence of student
support which the attendance will show cannot be
stressed too heavily. If you care about the future of the
Scarlet & Black and are willing to devote time and of»
fort to its success, you will be in the S&B office at 8:30
pm. tomorrow.

“The cops also smashed a TV
camera and tried tu take my film
away from me. The cops are so
little that you sort or growl at
them and make sure that none of
them sneak up on you from be
hind. All this took place when the
government police surrounded a
school where a group of anti-gov»
emment Buddhists were having a
meeting. All three networks, three
wire services, and many news-
papers were there — quite a
gathering really.

“Anyway, they told us to leave
and we said no. They don’t like
in have their handling or disslr
dents photographed (they are none
loo gentle).

“About our ambassador: The re-
porter that got beat up was British
and Within two hours after notify-
ing the British Embassy the em-
bassy ﬁled a very slrong note of
protest. The next day another of
our photographers, Steve Van
Meter, got beat up. We notified
the American officials and they
said that they would look into it.
They never did do anything. The
embassy and high military people
don’t like newsman, I’m afraid."

nodierne says that as of yet he
is in no position to comment ex-
pertly on the Vlet Nam situation,
“I didn’t really come here to do
that.” He went on to say, “All my
previous expectations about life
here were wrong. Before I came
over I read nothing which pre-
pared me ior this place, it's such
a complete shift from the 11.5. in
almost every respect. People try
to understand it in terms oi U.S.
standards, which simply do not
apply.”

In early July Hodierne was
wounded, though not very serious-
ly. while out on patrol with an
American armored column. “I
was riding in this personnel car-
rler (APC) and our artillery was
iiring protective rounds along the
jungle on either side of the road
(keeps Charlie back away from us
and helps protect us from amr
bushes). Anyway, they ﬁred one
volley rub close and I look schrap-
nel in my left arm and in my
chest near my right shoulder. Bled

worked on the extensive 5&3

5&3 Hodleme wrote, “You may

about things that happen outside
our sequestered Skinner box on
the prairie. You may, in tact,
find an editor who is quite bored
with things that have concerned
campalgning editors ol bygone
days. l'm not likely to become up-
set about SGA elections and the
like."

Hodieme often expressed his
discontent With college life at
Grinnell and wrote several col~
umns and editorials in Ihe 5&1}
about this. In one he wrote of a
nineteen-year—old soldier who was
shot in a Viet Cong ambush: “Hel

large Crop of leilermen
Favors Bright Grid Season

With a team built around 21 let-
termen, Grinnell is expected to be
in the thick of what shapes up as
the Midwest Conference’s wildest
football race in years,

The lettermen comprise more
than half of the 40-man Squad
which began drills last week. The
Pioneers open their season against
Cornell at Mt. Vernon Sept. 24.

Twenty of the veterans were
members of last year’s club,
which won six of eight games to
place second in the loop. The let
one lettered in 1964, but missed
lasl season while on an off-campus
study project,

"This year’s race should be a
real battle,” says Pioneer Coach
Edd Bowers. “Defending champ
ion Ripon has to get the nod, Grin-
uell, Belolt, Lawrence, and St.
Olaf all have a good chance to un-
seat the Reilmen. And Carleton
Cue, and Cornell will be tough too.

“We should be better than last
year because ui our experience
and could be very good,” Bowers
noted, but [lien cautioned, “we
could also hnish with a poorer
record because of the high level
of competition."

Bowers has experienced gridders
returning at every posllioh, with
the heaviest concentrations at and
(six letlel'men), guard (four), tear
kle and halfback (three apiece),
and fullback (two).

The big trouble spots are line-
backer, where all-conference per-
formers Tom Lannom and Paul
Thurston must be replaced, and
quarterback, where Barry Ander-
son, who set four Pioneer career
passing marks, has departed.

Veteran Rich Weeks and sopho-

 

more Tom Lower are expected to

Both are ranked as better run-

with an anticipated strong ground
attack.

The Pioneers will again he on
the small side — only four of ihem

‘We did a good job of compen-
sating for our lack of size with
the quickness last year and I think

Bowers stated.
