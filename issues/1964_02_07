day. -

Advanced reservation by col-
lege activity ticket will be re-
quired for admission to the 8

Six Coeds to Help
Mentally Retarded

Six Grinnell students will
spend the weekend of Febru~
ary 7-9 working at Woodward
State Hospital for the mentally
retarded, just west of Des
Moines.

Susan F o s t e r, Suzanne
Gelber, Susan Gilmore, Susan
Goldberg, Suzanne Watkins,

and Jean Watson will partici-
pate in a weekend institution-
al Service Unit, sponsored by
the American Friends' Serv-
ice Committee.

In this program, students
from several colleges spend
one Saturday and the follow
ing Sunday morning in the
wards of the hospital-school,
caring for mentally retarded
children. \

“The purpose of the pro-
gram," says Jean Watson, who
organized this weekend's trip,
“is to acquaint college students
with the problems of the men-
tally retarded.”

The program also includes
discussion and evaluation
session with volunteers and
leaders. During these ses-
sions, the students compare
reactions to the program, and
share their experiences.

The students sleep at the hos—
pitalschool, free of charge.
The only charge AFSC makes
for the weekend is $1.50.

Students interested in a simi-
lar trip may receive applica-
tions from Mr. Roger Eldridge,
college chaplain, or from Jean
Watson. Anyone may apply.

Termed by some reviewers
the “most distinguished chor-
ale ensemble to be presented
to the American public in al-
most a decade,” the group of
young Southern Californians
is currently making its third
(our of the U. S. and the Eu-
ropean continent, where they
will appear in 50 cities.

“They look like refugees
from a college prom,” wrote
Time of the Gregg Smith Sing-
ers at the Darmstadt Contem-
porary Music Festival last
year. “But they soar with un-
canny ease. . . through music
. . . as difficult as any being
written.”

The Gregg Smith Singers be-
gan in 1955, when Gregg Smith,
a graduate teaching assistant
in the music department of the
Lo 5 Angeles campus. Uni-
versity of California, gathered
a group of music students and
young musicians interested in
singing the new music and
rarelyrperformed old works.

Early in the group’s life,
support came from compos<
ers and other musicians in-
trigued by the unusual
phenomenon on the musical
scene—a choral group of pro-
fessional calibre actually de-
voting time and energy to the
singing of works other than

Handel’s “Messiah” and
other standards. Many were
contemporary compositions
never heard in concert be-
fore.

In 1958, an invitation came
from Monday Evening Con—
certs Director. Lawrence Mor-
ton, to perform Schoenberg‘s
Opus 27, a work which had been
scheduled several times before
but never offered because of its
complexity. “Actually, they ex-
pected us to turn them down,”
remembers Smioh. “But our
group felt there was an enor-
mous value in Schoenberg, not
to be overlooked, and that the
preparation and discipline in
volved would be good back-
ground for our doing other
composers." ‘ ‘

Ten months later, the eliLe
avant-garde Monday Evening
Concerts audience heard the
Schoenberg. “A standout,"
said the Los Angeles Times.

Prominent Roles in Midwest UN
Manned by 13 Grinnell Students

Thirteen Grinnellians will be
playing prominent roles when
the three-day Midwest Model
United Nations convenes in St.
Louis, March 18, for its third
annual session, Eight students
will be active in the leadership
of the conference, While five
others will represent the
school—taking the role of the
delegation from Portugal.

David Golden, Grinnell Sena
ior, who will serve as President
of the General Assembly at this
year's MMUN Conference, de-
scribed the meeting in St.
Louis as ”playing the serious
game of the United Nations.”

“Our main purpose is to
delineate the issues and to
show what happens when
countries have to become ace
countable for their policies
and actions," Golden said. In

In ‘0rder Seminar’

The “Interdisciplinary Semi-

second semes-
t e r w i t h a
speech by Dr.
Monroe Beards-
] e y, professor ‘

He will speak
on “Order and
D i s o r d e r in

p. m. Tuesday
in H e r r i c k

“The \ Nature of Artistic
Creation” will be presented
by Dr. Beardsley as the fine
arts lecture on Wednesday.
Both lectures will be open to
the public.

Dr. Beardsley received both
his bachelor’s and doctor’s de—
grees from Yale University. He
has taught at Yale and at Mt.
Holyoke College, going to
Swarthmore in 1947,

A specialist in the philoso-
phy of art, Dr. Beardsley has
written numerous articles and
papers, and several books.
Among these are “Practical
Logic," “Thinking Straight,"
and “Theme and Form,” of
which he is a co-author.

Dr. Beardsley is the eleventh
lecturer in the yearvlong semi-
nar series. He will be foll wed
by Dr, Charles Hartshorne of
the University of Texas, and

playing the game, the 500
delegates from schools
throughout the midwest learn
how this process occurs in
the actual United Nations
sessions in New York. This
process, ierces the nations to
confront issues and to com-
promise.

Delegations of five from over
a hundred colleges and univer»
sities throughout the midwest
will gather at the Chase Park
Plaza Hotel in St. Louis. Each
delegation will represent a
member nation of the United
Nations, These students will at-
tempt to take the role at the
Model UN which their country
plays at the General Assembly
session in New York. Thus, stu»
dents learn not only about the
policies of their country, but
also about the bloc of which
their country is a part,

The delegation from Grin-
nell, which will be represent-
ing Portugal, the last classi-
cal colonial power, is com-
posed of Dan Bucks, chair-
man, Phil Johnson, Peter

Miller, Tom Lane and Paul,

Thurston.

Golden explained that the
MMUN represents only the
General Assembly and the Se<
curity Council. These are the
parliamentary bodies of the
United Nations, and they do
little of its actual work. The
work i done by the agencies
and civil servants, but these
are the organs in which the
give and take among nations
takes place.

The General Assembly, in a
manner similar to that of the
United States Congress, does a
great deal of its work in Corn-
mittees, Golden explained. At
the conference itself, must of
the time is spent in model
committee meetings, and in
model General Assembly ESSA
sions. Each of the five dele«
gates from a school serves as
a part of the delegation in the
model General Assembly ses-

sions and also represents his
country on one of the five com-
mittees of the General Assent-I
bly.

Grinnell students will serve
as chairmen of these various
committees. Paul Courtright
will chair the Political and
Security Committee; Tom
Evans, the Special Political
Committee; Curt Lamb, the
Social, Cultural, and Human-
itarian Committee; Mike Pat-
terson, the Trusteeship Com-
mittee; and Paul Reichs, the
Economic and Financial Com-
mittee.

These schools whose coun-
tries sit on the Security Coun-
cil will send six delegates, on.
for each of the five commit¢
tees, and one to represent the
country at the model Security
Council meetings. Jack Chap<
man will serve as president of
the Security Council.

Another Grinnell studen'
Steve Fleck, is chairman o
the Conﬁrmations Committee,
responsible for the election of
officers and the continuation of
the conference from year to
year. Other major officers of
this year’s MMUN session are
students at the University of
Illinois and at Drake University
in Des Moines.

Proiect Gets Support

The National Science Foun-
dation has granted $9,900 to
Grinnell College to support a
catalytic research project. for
two years, starting this month.

The research, titled ”Soluble
Silica-Alumina Catalysts,” is
directed by Dr. Joseph D. Dan-
forth, professor or chemistry,
who has b e e n conducting
studies of catalysts, particular-
ly in their application to “crack
ing” of petroleum, over a long
period of years.

The new grant supplies con-
tinuing support for the studies
of catalysis begun under a
grant from the Office of Naval
Research in 1948.

The interim session looks good on paper. The
Junior Liberal Arts Exam impresses the prospective
student, and adds depth and polish to the college cata~
loguei But the fact remains — students consider both
the JLA and the interim “comic relief.”

A time designed for independent study finds the
students migrating to the train and bus_depot, rather
than to the library. Shelves in the bookstore remain
stocked with relevant material long after the syllabus
has been distributed. Lecturers, experts in their fields,
are brought to the campus — morning lectures attract
a great number of curious students, while later discus—
sion sessions entertain a handful of sleepy listeners.
The members of the junior class compare notes on how
little they have read about Aristotle, Darwin, or New-
ton, and proceed to deal out the next bridge hand,

What does it mean, this interim period? A two-
week paid vacation for a group of shiftless liberal arts
students who choose to party rather than prepare for
independent progress? It can hardly be a question of
Whether Grinnell students can study independently.
Regular course work, and advanced projects show that
they do a great deal on their own—both by choice and
by necessity.

But where, in the study plans for the interim ses—

the seniors, in preparing for comps, have the oppor-
tunity to do extensive work in a chosen field, and the
chance to graduate necessitates the completion of that
_work successfully.

' Although the JLA is not supposed to shadow the
interim period, the juniors have been restricted cornv
pletely during the last two weeks by its existence.
Their study is independent only in respect to whether
they do it or not For those students who decide to go
along with the experiment, at least two full weeks of
reading are mapped out by the syllabus. There isn’t
much room for-exploration in areas of personal interest,
and there isn’t enough interest in those areas supposed
to be explored The knowledge that no one has to pass
(unless he anticipates needing those four credits to
graduate) might relieve pressure, but it also eliminates
motivation. _

Sophomores and freshmen are guided by vague
plans for learning, and faithfully read books from the
proposed lists and attend their lectures for a while. But
when the interim is over, they have little more to show
for it than memories of sleeping late in the morning,
attending movies every night in ARH. and the appre-
hension that they are one year closer to the JLA sylla-
bus.

If the interim session is going to benefit just the
handful of underclassmen that take the maximum
amount of energy in an attempt to fulfill a rather
vague degree of responsibility, then it should be
abolished. Right now it exists as a lot of free time to
use up before classes start again,

If the juniors are going to have a JLA, then the
topics should be more relevant and more individually»
oriented. Some discrimination should be drawn be-
tween those who do the work and those who “bull"
their'way through; and with the topics as vague and
general as they are now, this is often not possible.

If the college wants to provide the student with
two weeks free from classes to pursue independent in
terests, the interests must be particularized for each
“body-student" rather than bin-aggregate “studenk
body." Let’s focus the interim session or scrap it.

The announcement by Mar-
‘gal'et Chase Smith that she
livnuld enter the New Hump
lshirc primary in an attempt to
secure the Republican presi-
dential nomination came as no
surprise to those of us who are
worried about Creeping femin»
ism in American society. Her
announcement should be a
clarion call of warning ibi-
those American men who have
not yet fallen under Lhe insid~
ious control of the opposite sex.

Whether there are any such
people left in our society has
been open to doubt. Former
President Harry Truman,
when asked about the possi-
bility of a woman president,

answered: “I don’t see why
not. They I u n everything
else, and if you don’t know
that now, you soon will."

Ambrose Bierce conveyed the
same impression when be de-
lined a Queen as “A woman
by whom the realm is ruled
when there is a king, and
through whom it is ruled when
there is not.”

Despite these statements, it
is clear to me that, fortunately,
men make most of the imporr
tant decisions in this world. I
say fortunately, for if these de-

 

Tom Wilmer—“h?
l

l

Cislons were made by women,
I doubt whether our civilizallon
could endure.

1 am a firm believer in the
doctrine of male supremacy.
This belief is firmly ground-
ed in empirical prejudice.
However, it would be foolish
for me to argue for a pro-
gram to deal with women’s
rights which was based on
the separate but equal con-
cept. That type of program
is no longer accepted by the
intelligent individual in to-
day’s society
What i do argue for is a
more realistic policy, a policy
which recognizes the necessity
for Women in socieiy and the
associations Which must take
place in such a society if it is
to continue to function. That
policy is based on the more
realistic and practical concept
of together but unequal.

The American woman simply
has not shown herself capable
of doing anything which re-
quires the slightest amount of
ingenuity and original thought.
She has shown herself inca-
pable of performing such minor
tasks as driving a car. A womr
an never parks a car; she
abandons it.

Women, of course, do have

 

their place in this world. if
trained properly, they make
excellent occasional compilfv
ions and have shown some
abilily in doing menial work.
The marriage vows recogiiice
that woman is suited to be a
servant to man. Each woman
at the altar promises to “love,
honor, and obey," her' hus-
band. That is as it should be.

Even Grinnell is not safe
from the insidious quest lor
equality for women, For those
who are complacent, I need
only point but that two of the
last ioui- S&B,editors have been
women.

One week from today will
begin a test for Grinnell Col»
lege. Next weekend is women‘s
weekend. Each man must de-
cide for himself what his own
Conduct will be during this Crit-
ical period.

I would only suggest that
Grinnell men act from a posi-
tion of strength. Reasoning
is useless with women, but,
like the lower form of intelli-
gence which they are, women
respect ﬁrmness and lame.
Before resorting to violence,
however, one is cautioned to
check with the humane so-
cieiy.

 

An Explanation

To the Editor:
in the last issue of the 5&3
there appeared an ad which

“Independent” Study

To The Editor:

Many faculty members have
been troubled. as has Tom
Fullmer, by the use of the term
“independent" of some study
here at Grinnell. 1 don’t know
which dictionary Mr. Fullmer
consulted. i should urge all to
acquire the habit of consulting
the rich treasury called for
short “N. E. D." — A New Eng-
lish Dictionary on Historical
Principles. N. E. D. meaning
number i for “independent" is

“Not depending upon the
authority of another, not in
position of subordination or
subjection; not subject to ex-
ternal control or rule; self-
g o v e r n in g, autonomous,
l'ree."

Absurdity develops ii we de-
fine “independent," as does
Fullmer’s dictionary as “free
from control or persuasion" in
an absolute sense This is
N. E. D. meaning 5:

“Not dependent on others
for the formation of opinions
or guidance of cpnduci; not
influenced by the opinions of
others; thinking or acting.
or disposed to think or act,
for oneself, (of persons, their
disposition, pm)"

One usage of (his kind is of
“ancindependent' and energetic
man who will vote as he
pleases." An extended use is

sion, is the notion of either choice or necessity? Only .

urged student support of the
advertisers represented in the
paper, andl feel that further
explanation is needed.

This year ihe Cyclone and
the 5&3 have taken their
business out of Grinnell, with
the Cyclone photography be-
ing done at Cedar Rapids and
the printing of the 5&3 being
done in Newton. The respec-
tive decisions to leave Grin-
nell were made after careful
consideration of the offers
made and the services to be
rendered.

Naturally Grinnell businesses
were upset at the loss oi this
business, and as of now three
firms have withdrawn their
advertising {r 0 m the 5&3.
These firms are Coast-to-Coast.
Cunningham's, and I. D.'s. This
could be understandable to the
publications' stalls, but there
are two obicciidns to the With-
draWEIls,

rim, boih publications are
on budgets, and they have to
get what they consider to be
the most for what money they
have 1 think that Grinnell
businesses should realize that
it takes more than location in

Grinnell to win the college

contracts and should offer

more than that in getting the
college business.

The second objection to the
withdrawal of the advertising
was the way in which it was
done. The three firms termi-
noted their business with the
idea that. they do no! need stu-
dent business and support for
their firms. Therefore, i think
all students should think about
this next time ihcy do any shop-

Adult: Mature?

To the Editor:

Perhaps the crux of our prob
lem within the Grinnell Commu‘
nity is the assumption we tend
to make that the terms “adult"
and “mature” are necessarily
synonymous. They may be, bui
need not be. We may have lor-
gotten the la ct that most
“Adults" are not “mature."

When the Community ap-
preached the s f u d e n t indi-
vidually or institutionally as an
“adult,” it made the assump-
tion — “mature."

The Community seems to for—
get that Che larger society has
many mechanisms which lunc-
tion constantly to discipline and
integrate socially the vast ma-
jority of the “adults” who will
never be “m a t u re," even
though they live a millennium.

with the campus political clubs
and iii the classroom upon re-
turn to the college next fall.
The internships will be equally
divided between Republican
and Democratic candidates,

Each intern will work un-
der the supervision oi a mem-
ber of (he Grinnell faculty.
Periodic reports will be sub-
mitted and a final evaluation
will be required upon com-

pletion oi the internship. Each
intern will be required to reg-
-ister for a two-hour indepen-
dent project during the fall
semester. The project will be
_based upon the internship ex-
perience.

Exam Slated For
future Teachers ’

College seniors planning to
teach school can take the Na—
tional Teacher Examinations
Feb. 15 at nine testing centers
throughout Iowa.

Scores on the examinations
are used by many large school
districts for employing new
teachers and by several states
ioi- granting teaching certifi-
cates or licenses.

During the full-day testing
sessron, iuture teachers may
take the common examination,
testing their proiessional knowla
edge and general educational
background, and one or two or
the 13 optional examinations,
measuring mastery of the sub
jects they expect to teach.

Iowa test centers include:
SUI; Iowa State University,
Ames; Stale College 01 Iowa,
Cedar Falls; Drake Universrty,
Des Moines; Loras College,
Dubunue; l) a r s o n s College,
Fairiickl; Uppe Iowa Univerr
sily, Fayette; Giinnell College,
Grinnell; and Morningsidc C01-
legc, Sioux City.

 

Pfitsch, (Phys. Ed.) and Wllv
ham 3, Vanderpool, (speech)
comprise the Committee. Win-
ners will be announced before
the Spring recess.

This is the fifth year for the
PPPE summer internship pro-
gram. In the summers of 1960
and lets: the internships were
with political candidates. Na-
tional pressure groups in the
nation’s capital played host
to the summer interns in
1961, and-last summer the in-
ternships were in the office
of two Ur S. representatives
and one senator.

Grinnell interns working in
Washington last summer were
Marilyn Ault, Jack Spence and
Phil Johnson.

Art Gallery Otters
Show by Talented
Parisian Children

By Ann ‘Showalter

“Close to German expres-
sionism in regard to What they
see in nature and in mature
artists’ responses to nature,”
said Robert w. McMillan (art)
of the painters whose works
are currently on exhibit in the
Schaefier Gallery of the Fine
Arts Building.

The paintings, by Parlsian
school children aged nine to
sixteen, are "crentivn and
free, yet controlled."
McMillan commented that
the paintings seem to show the
Parisian art teachers’ skill at
stimulating and guiding the
children’s freshness of response
to the world.

”This exhibit is not simply a
display of talent, but a display
of the potential which exists in
any group of children and in
adults,” he explained.

One of the problems at art
instructors of all educational
levels is trying to tree their
students from preconceived
ideas of what art should be
and from succumbing to
“someone else‘s sense of or-
der.”

In recent years the philos-
ophy of art instruction has been
changing. Formerly, it was
thought to be most important
to teach the child how to
“draw,” to describe accurately
the things he saw.

“Now art instruction tends
more toward description by
analogy than Strict analytical
d e s c r i p t i o n,“ McMillan
statedaThus, instead or paint-
ing a wateriall exactly as he
sees it, the artist may try to
capture the force behind the
waterfall.

McMillan noted that in
France, as in the United States,
the quality of art education
varies considerably from one
school to another. The current
exhibition is an example of
sophisticated art education
techniques used in the public
schools of Paris.

The paintings of people, still
life, and the Parisian landscape
are being circulated in this
country by the French Em-
bassy.

) Gregg Singers
Continued from Page 1

And then, the.versatile Gregg
Smith Singers followed with
Bach's Motet No. 6, establish-
ing a tradition which even now
characterizes every concert
appearance. R a r e l y , heard-
works of contemporary or early
composers are always balanced
with the classic choral works
and the music of America, tra-
ditionally folk. ‘

That same year, the Gregg
Smith Singers took their first
steps to international recog-
nition with a tour of Europe
that began with their spon-
taneous decision to partici-
pate in the International
Eistedfodd, a centuries-old
choral folk singing competi-
tion held in Wales. Here the
singers presented to continen-
tal music lovers the rich folk
music of our country. An in-
vitation for the group to sing
at the Brussels World Fair
and other concerts followed.

Twentyrﬁve young students,
musiCians, and composers piled
into a chartered bus headed for
New York, On the way they
sang in such widely divergent
U. S. Communities as David
City, Nebraska; Zion National
Park, and Chicago, Illinois.
Then they enplaned for London.
In six weeks they gave concerts
in Wales, France, Italy, Ger
many (including the Mozart-
eum in Salzburg), and Brus-

Golden: Entire Mock UN
is Arranged by Students

By Susan Taylor

David Golden, who will serve
as president of the General As-
sembly for this year‘s Midwest
Model United Nations Confer-
ence, emphasize?! that the con-
ference is “completely organ-
ized and run by students.“ Un-
like so many other student or—
ganizations of regional or ha»
tional’scope, MMUN does not
have any full-time employees.
All of its officers are full time
students at midwest schools,

The General Committee, this
year composed of the Grinnell
3 t u d e n t s, ,
a e l e c t s the
agenda items.
"We have to ,,
-c o m p r e s s
an October-to-
March session
into four days,"
G o 1 d e n ex-
plained Neces<
sarily, t h e n,
s o m e depar-
tures from ac-
tual Unite d GOLDEN
Nations procedures occur.

Golden explained that the or-
ganization gets some support
from the St. Louis chapter of
the American Association for
the United Nations, but the
students themselves make all
the arrangements and the de—
cisions “We’re really proud of
the fact that we run such an
excellent Conference,” Golden
said. "It proves that college
students 0 a n do something
that‘s constructive and means
ingful in an organized and ma-
ture manner.”

“We try to set up an organ-
ization to meet the United
Nations as it actually is,“ he
continued. Some of the dele-
gations ’go out of their way to
make the atmosphere more
realistic: they speak English
with an accent typical of the
country they represent; they
stage battles and play up
splits in the delegations on the
floor of the General Assem-
bly; and they give very so-
phisticated speeches.

"We have a few agenda items
that the United Nations does

not discuss,” he said‘ This is
to give the participating schools
a chance to do some Creative
work Within the philosophy and
in accordance with the record
of their country.

This year there are sixteen
agenda items. They include
such things as the admission
of Red China, disarmament,
withdrawal of A m e ri c a n
troops from South Korea,
the establishment of a perms-

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

nent UN armed force, the
Berlin question, the avail-
ability oi capital development
funds in the developing na-
tions, and, of special interest
to Grinnell delegation, the

noncompliance of the govern-
ment of Portugal with the
Charter of the United Nations
in its management of Portu-
guese overseas territories.

The delegations from the par-
ticipating schools may submit
resolutions on th e various
agenda items. Golden explained
that each of the five main com-
mittees considers three agenda
items and the resolutions sub-
mitted under them. Each coma
mittee reports one resolution to
be discussed by the General
Assembly, and m ay report
other resolutions to be voted
on but not discussed.

The model Security Council
will consider only one agenda
item — disarmament, Golden
said that, besides the fact that
the United Nations charter gives
the Security Council the issue
of armament control, the Gen-
eral Committee felt that this
item could he better discussed
by eleven nations than by a
hundred

Golden defined the purpose
of the Midwest Model United
Nations as “to provide educa-
tion for college students on

 

the United Nations itself -
how it Works through political
maneuvering, and the prob-
lems involved when you have

such diverse nations working
together for compromise.”

Golden himself believes that
we must support the United
Nations “as a living ideal;
something that’s here and rep-
resents a great possibility for
the future." Even though the
General Assembly, much of the
time, is a debating society, it
compels nations to confront is-
sues a nd compromise. “it
forces nations to stop shooting
and start talking,” he said. He
feels that the UN has made good
progress, especially in the eco-
nomic and medical areas.

Deeply involved with the
United Nations — as well as the
MMUN —.all of his college
career, Golden does not plan
any immediate activities relat»
ing to the world organization to
which he has devoted so much
time and effort. He plans to
spend the next few ‘years in
medical school. .

He is well prepared, however,
to serve as President of the
General Assembly at the third
annual MMUN, since he has
been active in the leadership of
the other two conferences. He
is also president of Clark Hall,
and treasurer of the Interna
tional Relations Club.

Third Class of 'liberul'luniors
Receive 1M 'Baptism By Fire

By Karen Adkinson

Yesterday and the day be
fore, Grinnell juniors recoil/ed
their baptism by fire, the Jun-
ior Liberal Arts Exam.

This institution is a fairly re-
cent innovation at Grinnell;
this year’s class is only the
third to have taken the exam.

Like the interim session, the
exam grew out of a faculty
study of curriculum. Prelimi-
nary work was done by faculty
groups with consideration and
final approval by the entire
faculty. Since then, several fac-
ulty committees have worked
year round developing the test,
the concepts, the syllabus and
bibliographies.

Associate Dean Waldo Walk.
er, who is in charge of the
exam, outlined the reasoning
behind the institution of the
exam: “One a! the principles
of a liberal arts institution is
that an education that cuts
across disciplines is a valu-
able asset to one that exper-

iences it, If this principle
holds, and a liberal education

h as tangible benefits, it

should follow that we might
well develop a device that
would indicate to the student
.his degree of success or fail-
ure in attaining the major
objectives of a liberal educa-
tion."

Besides measuring the at-
tainment of a liberal education,
the JLA exam is designed to
aid the student in synthesizing
the work of his Various courses
in an atmosphere of independ-
ent study. to offer him a diag-
nostic tool for analyzing his
strength and weaknesses, as
well as revealing to some ex-
tent the success of the college’s
effort in providing a liberal ed-
ucation. ‘

Although other schools have
had tests on the order of the
HA, Grinnell’s form is unique
and has sparked inquiries irom
other Midwest Conference col«
leges about the ILA expe-
rience.

The exam consists of an ob-

jective Area Test and two
mornings of essay responses
to concept questions. The in<
clusion of the nationally ad
ministered Area Test serves
to measure Grinnell students
against another norm and
also may aid the college in
assessing its role in the edu-
cation of its 'students. The
concept section previously
covered “The Nature of
Man” and “Evidence and

Evaluation,” but was
changed this year.

“The exam has been, and still
is, in an experimental stage,
’and. revisions have been found
necessary,” said Walker. “The
faculty narrowed the concepts
to the'more specific topics of
the Aristotelian, Newtonian,
and D a r w i n i a n conceptual
schemes of order because we
believed it too difficult to pre-
pare a satisfactory examina
tion around such broad con-
cepts as used in the last two
years." .

This year in preparation for
the exams, students received
bibliographies and a syllabus
pertaining to the concepts chos-
en. The primary bibliography
was intended to provide a start—
ing point and common fund of
information for all students;
the second bibliography, which
was more extensive, was one
from which students might se-
lect further readings in the
fields which most interested
them. ,

“This year the tests were
less oriented toward the syl-
labus than previously, In
fact, syllabus is too broad a
term for the document dis-
tributed to juniors this year;
it is more oi an introduction
to the concepts,” explained
Walker. ,

Grading of the tests is done
by the faculty Test papers are
passed out to faculty groups of
three to four members. Stan-
dards {or the answers are
available for consideration of
graders. Each paper is read
and graded independently by at

 

least three of the group. If the
grades disagree, the members
discuss the paper together, but
Walker revealed, “There has
been less variability in grading
than I had expeCted,"

Ranking will he done ac-
cording 'to three categories,
high pass, pass, and no credit.
Papers in the first two cate-
gories will be awarded four
hours of Credit. The test,
however, will not be a Pre-
requisite for graduation ei-
ther this year or for several
more years.

uate and former faculty mem—
ber of Grinnell, has been ap—

Pioneers Top (0e; To Meet Rams Tomorrow

By Pete Kollman

Grinnell remained in the
thick of the MidWeSL Confer-
ence basketball race with a
hairsraising 73-71 victory over
Coe last Saturday in Darby
Gym, The game was a “must"
for the Pioneers and the win
put them into a second place

tie with Cornell, both teams/

only one game behind league
leading Ripon.

The game started slow with
neither tealn looking particu—
larly impressive, Coe failed to
hit from the field for the first
6 minutes and trailed 10-4 at
that point. Then the Kohawks
began to connect and the game
became a see-saw battle with
the Pioneers in the lead most of
the time. A basket just before
the halftime horn by Dick Ul-
rich, Pioneer guard, sent Grin-
nell to the dressing room with
a 38732 lead.

Affer the half, the game
”see-sawed" again, but the
Pioneers steadily increased
their margin until it reached
ll points with about 10 min-

utes to play. At this point the
game seemed safely in
Grinnell’s hands but the K0-
. hawks fought back and took
the lead with about three and

a half minutes remaining.
Grinnell retaliated with two
buckets to make the score
71-68.

Once again, it looked like the
game was safely won but a
missed free throw and a bad
pass put Coe in possession
trailing 71—70, when Kohawk
guard Dave Collie was fouled.
He sank his first free throw
but his second bounced off the
rim, The jump ball which en-
sued was controlled by the Pio-
neers, who called a time' out
with 23 seconds remaining to
be played. Grinnell waited un-
til 8 seconds showed on the
clock, when Jeff Ftantz shot
from 2|) feet out. The ball
bounded high but Pioneer cen-
ter John Sundell was there to
stuff in the winning basket.

Notable performances for
Grinnell were turned in by co-
captains Jim leilin, who
scored 23 points and got ll re—
bounds, and John Sundell, who
scored 16 and pulled in 24 re-
bounds; and by reserve guard
Ulrich, whose' pass to Mifflin

under the basket enabled the
Pioneers to regain the lead,
69-68, and whose ensuing good
fake and lay-up gave them a
three point hulge. Guard Jim
Eeckman led the Coe scoring
with 20 points.

Bothteams were equally cold
from the field, each shooting
33 percent. Neither team did
much better from the free
throw line with Coe hitting 11,
of 20 for 55 percent andi
Grinnell hittiing only 9 of 43‘
for 39 percent.

Grapplers io Resume Action:
Journey to Dubuque University

By Ken Clymcr

Grinnell’s undefeated varsity
wrestlers open the second half
of their season tomorrow with
a non-Conference bout against
Dubuque University on their
mats. Dubuque threatens to
give the Pioneers more com-
petition than they have prev-
iously encountered.

Before Christmas the mat-
men had compiled a 4-0 record
by defeating Lawrence (39-0),
Ripon (3273), Simpson (22-10),
and Warthurg (22-15% With
their best team in years the
Pioneers hope to give peren-
nially strong Cornell a real
battle for the conference chant»
pionship March 6th and 7th.
Last year Grinnell surprised
the whole Conference by edging

out Carleton for the
spot.

At Dubuque, coach Edd
Bowers plans to wrestle Bill
Barnes (123 lbs.), Ken Stub<
ler (130 lbs), Al MacKnight
(131 lbs.), Will Van Home
(147 lbs.), Ken Clymer or
Nick Nonas (157 lbs.), Larry
Miller (167 lbs.), Jeff Lewis
(177 lbs.), and Morgan
Michel (Hwt.). Barnes, Mil-
ler, Lewis, and Stuhler re-
main undefeated in du all
matches so far this season.
Lewis has pinned four oppo-
nents in four matches.

The grapplers‘ final home
matches Will be held in Darby
Gym next Friday and Saturday

against conference opponents
Carleton and St. Olaf.

the floor in Darby Gym. The
7:30 Contest Will not only break
the second place tie, but it Will
probably drop the loser out of
contention for the Conference

Ripon is leading the race with
an 8-1 mark while Cornell and
Grinnell are both 6-2. Ripon,
however, faces a tough sched-
ule this Week as well. Fourth
place Knox, which defeated
the Redmen last week and res
juvenated Monmouth will be
the visitors.

Grinnell coach, John Pfitsch
is still uncertain about his

starting lineup. Since Kin-

kead’s departure the team
has not been Working togeth-
er as smoothly as before.
He hopes to remedy this with
a few changes. John Sundell,
of course, will Start at cen-
ter with Jim Mifflin at one
forward position. Either Jeff

Frantz or Clyde Smith will

start at the other forward.

Three guards, Dick Ulrich,
Tom Buchholtz, and Dave Sel-
lergren will see a great deal of
action. Pfitsch has been im-
pressed with Ulrich’s play in
the last few games and Buch-
holtz is probably the best out~
side shot, Sellergren has been
a regular starter.

The Rams boast two of the
top scorers in the conference
in Jack Grams, the scoring
leader, with 22.3 points per
game and Dick Calbow who is
averaging 18.1. Dal Zierk and
John Shillinglaw will be the

probable starters at guard with
John Allhaugh at Center. Bob
Moore should also see quite a
bit of action at center as he
is B-ﬁ and may be needed to
guard Sundell.

Cornell uses a zone defense.
the best in the league, while
Grinnell uses a man to man.
Coach Pfitsch is counting on
Sundell to keep Grams from
raising his average, but says
that he is not particularly con-
cerned about the team's de-
tense. “Our biggest worry is
getting the ball through the
hoop."

the refusal tlo be obliged to any-
one for anything. In this con»
text, that of learning, such a
meaning of “independence”
_would imply that each of us
can learn nothing or should
learn nothing from anyone
else. If this is absurb, then
where may well be sense, very
good sense, in saying: there
are opportunities to learn un-
der circumstances freer in
some respects than those you
have known heretofore. Why
should an administration and
{acuity say, for a short period
to students and faculty: no
classes and no attendance re-
quired; no course grades, no
course texts? The point is to
focus on topics of maximum
Importance: — the nature of
man, his use of symbols, the
nature of planetary system and
motion of its parts,

Mr. Fullmer has missed the
educational bus if he thinks
that the interim speakers are
solely to entertain, solely to pre-
yent death by boredom, or that
the writing of essays is solely
to consume excess paper, or
that senior comprehensives are

iven as punishment. Of course,

e is speaking ironically, pos-
sibly as spokesman for those
who miss the bus.

The job of learning to be
your own boss, to formulate
a design for learning and to
carry out a project is diffi-
cult. or course it can't be
taught as training in read
ing, or learning about the
city (reference to the history
bibliography.) Requiring stu-
dents to present a plan would
indeed help many students to
avoid intellectual vagrancy or

simple truancy. But won’t we
have to rely on the individ-
ual‘s desire :0 learn for its
own sake?

There is no perfect system
of education; any system will
fail to be the best for every
scholar involved in it. Some
will go home during interim,
some will sleep rather than lis-
ten and discuss, some will be
bored and seek diversion, We
can say sourly that these types
shouldn’t be here, and we’ll
have to pick Students Who will
appreciate being weaned from
the educational breast or bottle,
and ready to outgrow spoon

feeding of pabluml It would be ‘

better to say that no system
can be completely successful.

 

After all, in consolation after
each of the 36 semesters 1 have
taught, I say that lawyers lose
half their cases, and physicians
eventually lose all their pa-
tients, and ways of salvation
are also ways of damnation
(a “perfect hell,” required log-
ologically, says K. Burke, as
well as a perfect heaven).

As for submitting u “pr0<
gram" to an adviser—why
not now adopt Howard Bow-
en’s proposal that each stu-
dent ke e p an intellectual
diary through his four
years? It‘s the task of each
of us to ensure that our win-
ter interims and semesters
and summer interlms add up
to a pattern of coherence be«
yond the ability of any test.
The results may not appear
quickly or be recognized
swiftly. The excellence of
George Berkely‘s student
diary took more than 200
years to be appreciated.

The catalogue uses the ideal
of ”independence” in an intel-
ligible sense — developing the
abilities to formulate hypo-
theses, to judge whether the
evidence confirms or discon»
firms, to imagine what we are
not told, and to go beyond all
received opinions. This is
called becoming a person oi
“independent” judgmen .”

“Liberal’ education is too
much conceived as “general"
in contrast to “special and ap-
plied or technical.” Whether
this plan will work to free us
from “servile bonds," from
“envy,” from "‘rumours,” as
Sir Henry hoped of his scholars
at Eton, depends on how‘seri-
ously we believe in it, we ens
sure that it won't work. it we

do act on the belief that it will,
very likely it will some of the

time, I’d rather see it work
some of the time, so I choose
to stress its promise.

Informal Student-Faculty Discussions
Are Insiilnied by Board of Religion

By Suzanne Gelber

“A grass roots attempt to
solve a grass roots problem,”

stated Board of Religion presi-
dent Paul Courtright, charger
terizillg recently formed stu-
dent-faculty discussion groups.
Genesis of the groups lay in
student and faculty concern
with factionalism and aliena-
tion within the college commu-
nity.

Instituted and organized by
the Board of Religion, some
thirty discussion groups now
exist, each possessing one
faculty member and approxi-
mately six student partici-
pants. Eager to promote an
“honest exchange of views"
between students and faculty,
Courtright hopes the meetings
will “clear the campus chan-
nels of communication.”

Speaking frankly, the Board
of Religion president noted that
uncreative attitudes t 0 w a r d
rule changes and student-facul-
ty dichotomy seriously affect
Grinnell’s public image. “The
college community should be a
unified organism. We don’t
know exactly what the college
problem is, so these discussion
groups represent an attempt at
direct definition. and indirect
solution," maintained Court-
rightl

Set up to provide variety of
class and gender, the discus-
sion groups have draWn a
slightly heavier response from
freshmen and sophomores than
from juniors and seniors, and
from women students, rather
than men

“What is important,” stated
Courtright, “is that student and
faculty response to discussion
has been genuinely critical and
open.”

Originating from a discussion
between Roger Eldridge, col-
lege chaplain, and Courtright,
the groups were conceived with
the express idea of airing view-
points on facultyrstudent rela
tionships

Art Arnold H No. 461,

Courtright mentioned that
the administration image of
Grinnell seems to stem from
identification of the college
with schools such as Oberlin
and Carleton and results in a
feeling that Grinnell‘s rules

are liberal by comparison. 0n
the other'hand, students tend
to compare Grinnell with in-
stitutions such as Swanhmore
and Reed, by whose stand-
ards college rules appear
restrictive.

Explaining that such conflicts
contribute to alienation, Court»
right expressed the conviction
that discussions held under
auspices removed from faction-
alism would provide a form [or
objective consideration of dif-
fering viewpoints.

The twelve-member Board of
Religion itself operates on a
$1500 annual budget, drawn
from Sunday chapel contribu-
tions, which go to support the
college religious program and
Ahmednagar College in India.
Students servo two»year terms
on the Board, which Courtright
hopes will ”deal with broad
campus issues with ever-in-

creasing effectiveness."

 

'There will be no services
in Herrick Chapel this Sun-
day, due to the “between se-
mester" break. Regular col—
lege services will resume
next Sunday, Feb. 16. Mr.
Roger Eldridge, college
chaplain, will give the ser-
mon.
