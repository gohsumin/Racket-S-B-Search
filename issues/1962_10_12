Women's hours?

Some Grilinell authorities apparently feel that with-
ticlt women's hours free love would flourish and ti lt Gilli-
nell would immediately be tabbed as a college with low
tr l'al standards
l THESE REASONS seem to me to lie based largely on
conjecture. I have always felt hours regulations to be a
c'enial of a basic right of women students: to decide for
themselves how they will live their days i all 4 hours 01'
titemi

A morality dependent on regulations rather than
one founded on conviction is a handicap, not an asset.

Grinnell's women will not have the “convenience" of
cill'fews all their lives. Why impose upon them a set: of
regulations which relieves them from the responsibility
ct mak lg decisions which will. for many, inevitably arise
after giadnation.

And “ill the name of the college suffer that much?
Will it be criti ized by those people \ihos Clitlcisln can

To the Editor,

The Executive cabinet has per:
vcrtcd the foundations of student
government. They have usurped
our right and have decided that
student government is not for

,thc students but is a place to

test the effectiveness of “power
politics," These budding politic
crans have ignored thc rcoucsts
and rights of the students in
their quest for selfraggi‘andize-
rnent.

WHEN QUESTIONED about
the Missisippi resolution, 104
out of 13:: students requested ‘an
all-campus referendum on the
‘issue. The Strident Senate added
its unanimous approval of such
a l'efelcndum in response the
Executive cabinct denied both
rccucsts.

Boston explained the
cabinets action by blaming it
on student apathy. This nrust
bc false. for by their actions
the students have deﬁnitely
demonstrated their concern.
Mr. Boston further complains
. of disinterest in student gov-
eminent. Yet when interest is
ﬁnally d'plnycd. he and the
exccirtivc cabinet stiﬂe it and
promote further disinterest by
ignoring the voice or the stu-
, dcnls.

The preservation of student
government lies in on hands.
We must express our dissatisfac—
tion with this course of events
Thc leaders must bc cducatcd in
the fundamentals of democratic
govcrnnrcnt. Mr. Boston and Mr.

incn in st be stopped in

FORUM;
DiiEENi

By Tom Phillips

For my initial ioray into tile
acid of “columny.” 1 would like
to takc up a question which is
often found burning upon the
nation‘s campuses, and which. i
imagrnc, Continues to smoldcr on
into later lifc. Thc question be.
ing. of coursc, “Which is bettcr,
communism or capitalism?"

Now rm going to approach
this seriously. My friends often
tell me that communism is
better because: it eliminates
selﬁshness rind competition
which result in vicious econ
ncmic and social inequalities.
That it provides noble common
goals instcnd of personal goals
And that. by its control of the
means of production, it is bets
tcr able to comply with actual
demand, thus doing away with
big surpluses. recessions, and-
similar phenomena

Now I realize that what my
fricnds are doing is describing
communism in theory rather
than communism in practice, but
that doesn't really bother me at
all. What really bothers me is
that they arc ignoring a big
ccntrcl oucstrcn which is also
rather obvious, namely, “15 conic
munisrn “in” (Or more propor—
ly. "Would communism be tum")

HERE I‘M GOING to take my
stand, 1 like capitalism bctter
than communism because the
former is more fun than the lat-
tcr: that's my stand. And now
lct us take some Cesas in point,

Last week. aftcr an extended
abscncc, the Minncapalrs and St.
Louis freight train resumed run-
ning through the middle of our-
campus as in ola- of yore, And
do you know what happened
when that ﬁrst train of the ycai
hovc into view? Wcll, about any

people empted from
nearby buildings and chalged
out to the railroad tracks yell-
ing and waving.

IN THE UNION. a lot of pet)—
gatlrcrcd around lhc windows
to watch, and among other
things they saw one young lady
run alongside a boxcar and
jump up onto one of those littic
ladder-s.

People like that train. and
now we must attempt to tie-
lineate why: partly because of
the whistle and the nnise, part-
ly because you can wave to
the cabooscman and he'll wave
back, but mostly because of
those boxcars with signs on
them: slog-airs like Route of
thc Vista-Dome North Coast
Limited," or "Ship it on the
'Frisro," or “The Peoria Gate-
way," or that very best one of
nlL "The Southern Serves the
South." Wonderful signs. Ciill
forth visions,

At this point 1 would like cw
cryonc to cast his or her mind
back to that Russian movie we
all saw in Roberts theater, the
one in which we got a good
extended look at a Soviet freight
train.

were all lhc same
color, weren’t they? And the
same size, And did you per,
chance see any picturcs on them,
lrkc that mountain goat on the
Greal Norther-n bexcars'.’ And
would you. my friends, have rim
out of the Union with such glee
to greet a long. plain. grav
freight train?

Well. i have another main
vclorrs example which conccr
a teddy bear 1 won at Concy
island. and some very witty
Burma-Shave signs which i real-
ly should inform gcu or. but
I'm afraid that space rcuuln ions
preclude such obstr-cpcr sir :. And
so, until then. 1 remain.

Rev. Benedict describesllilemmasl

facing people of the ‘inner tiiies' ,

By Nanci Ferguson
5 do is Staff Writer

“The American City in a Rev»
olutionary World” was discussed
by the Rev. Donald L Benedict
last Friday morning in Herrick
chapel. it was the' third in
series of critiques oi American
culture sponsored by the Board
of Religion.

Rev. Benedict is the director
oi the Chicago city Missionary
Society and has spent all of his
ministry in the “innencitics” oi
New York, Cleveland and c1
cage, He described a home mi
sionary as “a foreign missionary
without a halo or furlough" and
said that from the inner city
one can see what is happening
in the entire world.

Benedict listed three main
revolutionary iorecs which are
loose in the world today and
which can he secn irorn the
inner city. The ﬁrst at these
farce: is technology; it has he-
come the “god oi culture." He
went on to say that in some
parts oi Chicago 25% of the
male workers are unemployed.
and that as a result the chil—
dren lose their sense at aspira—
tion and [eel that “there is no

Point in learning or getting a by saying that the church must‘

Urbanization, the

tion has led to three kinds of
alienation.

THE FIRST is the alienation
of man from man which is lound
in segregation. An example of
this type can be felt riding in
a subway at rtish hour, whenl
onc develops a “subway stare“:i
that is, being able to ride on a
subway With the eyes open while"
seeing nothing. ‘

The second type of alienation.
is that or man from commun y,‘

Harpsichordisi
will begin 1962
concert series

By Mary Gwynneavaughan
s at 3 Stan Writer

Ralph Kirkpatrick, regarded
by some as “the world's greatest
harpsichordist," will open this
year’s concert series with per-
formances Friday and Saturday
next week at a p.m. in Roberts
theater. .

Kirkpatrick's early - reputation
as an “authority,” established
by his relatively tcw writings
and editions, has been followed
by his general recognition as a
pertormer oi the ﬁrst rank

He has- long been known to
music lovers ol this country. but
recently has expanded his ea—
reer to the extent that his para
torinanees abroad now outnum—
ber those in the United States.

in addition to pertorining‘at
the Vienna, Berlin, Edinburgh.
Lucerne and Allsbach iestivals,
Kirkpatrick has been welcomed
by numerous countries as an
interpreter of their own music.
He has been engaged to play
Scarlatti in Italy. Mozart and
Haydn in Vienna, English music
in London and French music at
Versailles.

Besides making harpsichord
recordings, Kirkpatrick has re-
corded his clavichord playing
and has pertormed on the eight
acnllrcentury piano and the
modern piano. ,

Reservations tor the Kirkpat-
rick harpsichord concert must
be made in advance at the stu-
dent uoion irom lo a.m to l2
noon or lrom 2:30 to 4:30 pm.
next Tuesday through Thursday.
Activity tickets will be required.

THE LAST KIND et' alimla»‘
tion explained by Benedict is‘
that oi man ironi God. In our
culture, he said. there is a feel:
men feel that there is nothing
they can do about lite. There iSr

a popular lallacy that knowl-

SCARLET AND BLACK

edge of a problem solves it. Hal

concluded hy saying that a loss‘
at transcendence results in a loss
at Justice. a loss which' should
not occur in a culture where it
is believed that all men are sons

of God and equal under ‘Him. ‘

Sen-determination was cited
by Benedict as the third revolue
tionary iorce in our world to-
day. This iorce was on the verge‘
of completion at the time of the
American Revolution and
ﬁnally he realized with the
equality ct Negroes to whites.

Benedict stated that the
main questions iaeing whites

today ar ~ “Do Caucasians

have the spiritual depth to ab-
sorh 200 years of terror?" and

“Can we absorb the hostility

oi the American Negro who is

now going to assume his right-
iul place in society?”

Benedict concluded his lecture

realistically {ace the problems

by-lzroduct of the metropolis, and that tllel
by role oi the church must vary inl

order lo deal with the techno—

eity and the outer city.

Grinnell to defend perfect mar/t; $72M
face Coe in homecoming event

By J. Eric Jacobson
5&3 stair Writer
Grinnell's unbeaten football
team will risk its pericct rec-
ord against a young and sure
prisingly good Coc team in a
Homecoming hattlc here tomor-

row.

Coo. with only eight ex-
perienced players returning
from last year's squad, was a
preseason choice to wind up
in the second division, out the
Kohawks have put themselves
in contention for the title by
posting a 271 record and tying
for second in conference
standings.

The Kohnwks dropped the‘
opening game to St. olaf he-
iore upsetting highly rated
Riponl Last week they mauled
Knox 34-0.

COE EXHIBITS a strong run-
ning attack from a wmg»T of—
fense. Halfhack Ken Poling,
fullback Jack Fridley and quar-
terback Warren Nicholas pro»
vide the offensive punch,

The Kohzlwks have an exper-
icnced defensive line which
runs several defenses. The over-
all team speed is good.

Pioneer conch Edd Bowers

is looking toward Coe as a
crucial game. “It's :I real im—
portant game against a coming
team. A win could put us in
an excellent position in the
conference," he stated.

day against Coe on Ward ﬁeld.

Both teams will use the

fans should be alert for the
use of the belly series and

Coe is expected to hold an-
other strong freshman team,
making this a ditticult contest

punt rolled dead on the Grin-

a 22-yard Art Peterson to Gene

AN UNUSUAL aspect of this
depth shortage is that there are
six capable guards, yet icw ends

for an end who has size and can
catch the hall. in comparison
with the line, the backs are in
good shape, and are the strong
point of the team.

Moore tccls that this year's
team has developed more quick—

This, he says, is because Moore!

the young coach has one year or

Worried frowns are beginning to form on the brows
10f Grinlicll’s full-sports coaches. Here it is, October 12, and
lilo Grillilell athletic team has yet managed to lose it con-
lfei'eiice contest. “Has the faculty read in the 5&3 that
lour winning teams tire the result of '1)1'ccise calculatioli’

lili recruiting?” the coaches might well be wondering.

‘ There hasn’t been I! mill [or a fllculty investig tion
iyct. But if the Gl'innell athletic teams don’t stop their ins
lcessantg victory mongering, an investigation is in order.
i If I had the pleasure of heading a facility investiga-
:tion coln’mittee, I’tl first question Irv Simone, the soccer
iconch. I’d ask him what effective scouting network had
‘idl'scovei-ed two of his top players, Frank Chilingulo and

lViliceiit Anltti, both students from Africa.

1 I’d budget- him further about his well conditioned soc-
‘cel' co-cziptains, Bill Molitfoi't (from New Jersey) rind Don
iCook (‘ll'om Geneva, Switzerland). Then, as Couch Simone
lsat speechless (from guilt of course), I’d turn my ntteiis
‘thllS' to Dick Young, the cross country coach.

l I’D‘ ASK YOUNG how he managed to come up with
‘ifive sophomore runners just as the varsity hopes began

ito dim. If he replied that three of these runners had not

‘revell l‘llli cross country in high school, I’d look on to facts
illnll.

Here I'd put both Head Coach Edd Bowers and his
football assistant, Athletic Director John Pfitsch, on the
island. I‘d continue lny questioning along the same line as
before. Hours later, after Coach Pfitsch had finished his
opening I‘em‘dl'l and had noted the high grade-point ave s
rig-c ol‘ Gi'illliell athletes and the fact that the Grilmell Col-
lege football team‘s roster lists players from 13 states, I’d
motion that the committee cancel tiny further investigation.

Young has been studying
karate for three years and has

karate for the Hawaii Karate

The course will include some

found karate to be more eitcc.
livc in selfsclcfense, but there
are several things in jujiisu
which are also Valuable.”

The basic principle oi both
karate and ju tsu as Young
explains it is this: you strike
your opponent as he is about
to strike you. in this manner
the combatant can beat his
opponent to the punch as well
as attacking him while he is

such as the side of the hand or
the foot. It is this fucusilig of
power which enables a karate
expert to do the imports stunt
of slicing a board or brick into
two halves with his bare hands.

Young is quick to emphasize
that destroying bricks is not at
all a concern oi karate but
merely a demonstration oi the
cap-abilities of a karate trained
person,

THE SPORT of kaiatc is sim-
ilar to boxing with the addition
oi the use at feet. All blows and

highly iniurious or iatal are

The match is judged on the tech

however, he will go more into:

to continue working and some-
day hopes to reach black belt

FROM THIS desire to merely‘
learn sellsdel'ense through
karate, Young has developed an
interest in the whole Japanese
Civilualion. He says, “From
karate a person can learn about
