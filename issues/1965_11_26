Five Students Face FCSA
0n Illegal Visitation Charge

Three Langan hall students Wednesday
night were given the option of withdrawing
from school or being dismissed, and two
Read hall students were suspended for the
remainder of the academic year as the
result of an incident last Friday night when
the ﬁve were found together in one of the
men's rooms after hours by Dean of Men
5, Eugene Thompson and Assoclate Dean
Richard Wintel‘s.

The penalties, as issued by the faculty
committee on student allairs, were original-
ly to have included the dismissal of the
men and optional withdrawal by the women,
but individual appeals to the FCSA led to
a lessening of the punishments.

All five students will be allowed to peti-

 

 

 

 

 

 

tion the committee for the right to take
final examinations for this semester in
absentia.

According to Thompson, he and Winters
had informed Langan president Richard
Relchmann that sometime in the future they
would come to the hall to look for tran-
sients who were believed to be staying with
students in Langan basement. Relchmann
said that earlier that Friday he had told
residents of the basement that Thompson
might come over at any time.

When the two deans arrived, they found
the ﬁve students. Because the five were
apprehended by administration officials, the
Case went immediately to the FCSA instead
of to the student courts.

Yolk’s on SAGA, Bul Eggheads Fry

The first conduct probation pen—
alties of the year were handed out
recently by the Dean of Men’s oi-
ficc to tour north campus residents
who splattered eggs in the Saga
office in Cowles hall late last
month. ,

S. Eugene Thompson, dean of
men, said that the four — two sen-
iors, and or junior, and a sopho-
more « returned to campus and
messed up the ollice after town
police had apprehended them for

throwing eggs at automobiles in
downtown Grinnell. ‘

Police filed no charges against
the tour, although they reported
the incident to Thompson. Thomp-
son learned of their involvement in
the Sega office incident when he
questioned the four about the down
town episode,

One senior was placed on pro-
bation tor the rest of the school
year. The others will be on proba-
tinn until the end of the semester.

 

North Campus Problem
Assessment Underway

By BOB HODIERNE

Discussion Conolnuas about the
“North Campus Problem" wheth-
er it exists and, if it does, what
to do about it.

Grinnell’s President Glenn Leg-
gelt said in an intervtew last
week that “Dean Winters and I
both are persuaded that the res-
idence hull system is working well
in some halls and not so well in
others."

“The ‘North Campus Problem’
has a variety of causes, some ol
which have no relation to the res-
idenco hall system," said Dr. Leg-
gett, Some of the causes he liso
ed included a small town loca-
tion, the level or academic pres-
sure, nonexistent supervision ex-
cept by students, students having
been reared in a permisslve at-
mosphere, and pressure from
the general state of the world,
especially the threat that the war
in Viet Nam presents to college
men.

When asked if he was dlSSEtlSe
lied With the way the Student
Government Association had en-
larced rules, Dr. Leggett said,
“Yes, In some cases. But what I
don’t know is if it's the system
or unfortunate leaders."

The Executive Council of the
laculty, which has been discussing
the problem “very informally”
for about a month now, feels that
“anti-intellectualism is pretty pre-
valent on north campus," ac-
cording w Dr. Leggett. “There is
excessive moral neutrality in the
residence hall system," he added.

Calling himself an “idealist."
Dr. Leggett said the halls ought

 

to “satisfy two needs-one practi-
cal, one idealistic."

The practical needs, said Dr.
Leggett, include being “quiet o-
nough for study, orderly and tidy
enough to be clean, and well
enough regulated idl- respect for
privacy, personalities, and prop-
am,”

The idealistic needs of the halls
as outlined by Dr. Leggeit includ-
ed a reflection at the “ongoing
academic and educational pm-
gram, The transition from class,
library and lectures to hall life
should be natural. It should not be
from one life to another."

The president went on to say,
in the same idealistic vein, that
“there Should be a feeling of a
community of young scholars."

He also stressed that he is
“eager not to be represented as
a man who has a ‘thing' about
the residencs nail system.“

Several o! the proposals that
have been discussed by the Exec
utive Council at one time or an-
other included arranging the halls
by class. One suggestion was to
put all the freshmen together in
several halls With upperclass ad-
visers. A second suggestion would
have had the seniors living to
gelher with relaxed housing regu-
lations. "I haven't heard much
about lihese proposals recently,"
said Dr. Leggett.

Dr. Leggett commented that
whatever change is selected—
and it seems certain that some
change will be made—the “Valid-
ity of the program should relate
to how it improves the education<
al almosphere and not be just a
group of ‘don'ts‘ for students."

Grinnell Sends Twenty Students to D.C.
To Join March Aguinsl Viel Nam War

20 Grinnell students left Wednes~
day afternoon on a chartered bus
to Washington, D.C., where to«
morrow they will join an expected
30,000 protesting the war in Viet
Nam. The marchers are advocat-
ing immediate ceasefire and de-
mobilization, with subsequent with-
drawal of United States troops.

Five sob reporters and photo-
graphers are in Washington to cov-
er the protest march for next
week’s paper, which will he the
trial issue for the newly elected

editor, Bob Hodieme.

The bus which took the Grim
ncllians to the nation's capital was
chartered by Herbert Hoover, 'an
Iowa farmer and pacifist.

The Washington march has been
organized nationally by the Com-
mittee for a Sane Nuclear Policy.
with the cooperation of other
groups.

A march sponsored by student.
for a Democratic Society in Wash-

Realm of FCSA in Changes
Confined lo Mere 'Courl'esy'

“Our role in the proposed
changes in the hall system is min-
imal. I think we are being con-
sulted out at courtesy more than
anything else," said John Burma
(sociology). chairman of the lac-
ulty committee on student affairs.

Burma sald this Week that his
committee has been discussing
possible changes in hall structure
and that witllin two weeks the
FCSA will make a recommenda-
tion to the Executive Council of
the faculty.

President Glenn Leggett has
asked the Executlve Council to
make a wide-ranging investigation
of the present hall set-up at Grin-
hell.

Burma noted that the FCSA will
be consulted in the event that any

hall system reorganization should
require concomitant changes in
such areas as the student courts.

Ed. note: In the Oct. 15,1965,
issue of the 5&3, Burma said
that his committee saw its
major duty in the area or pol~
lcy rather than in speciﬁcs.

The FCSA, he said, would not
handle such matters as a pos-
sible exlension of women‘s
hours by 30 minutes on Friday
nights, but “we would be con-
cerned with a possible change

To the Editor:

The Student Senate three weeks
ago rejected by a vote of 14-7 8
groposal to give $15 to the Des
ioines Project. The primary ar-
Xument for not giving money was
that money allocated for social
purposes shouldn’t be used icr any-
thing other than social events. be-
cause of the Senate‘s record in
consistently voting money to the
National 5 t u d e n ts Association,
which certainly doesn’t provide
social opportunities for more than
one or two Gl‘innell students, Ind
the restrictive implications it has
for the jurisdiction ot the senate,

found this argument untenable.
Upon further discussion alter the
meeting, one senator indicated he
used this argument or social funds
only for social purposes merely as
. tront, and he opposed the prey:
eat for another reason. He didn't
think the project was being run
efficiently and involved expendi-
tures of money with few or no sub-
Itan '3], positive results. It is this
criticism of the structure and ei-
iectiverless of the Des Moines
project on which I focused nly ab
tention and traveled to Des Moines
in hopes of learning more about
the program.

I spent about four hours in Des
Moines with Billy King, who is on
ganiling the Des Moines Project.

uring this time we took pictures
of a house that had faulty wiring
and poor rooting. The occupant
was going on rent~5trike until the
house was repaired and wanted a
record of the complaints. We
Ipent the rest of the day visiting
people in the neighborhood. Many
of the people were Billy's friends

and the calls were little more than
social ones. But in the afternoon
we called on strangers, telling
them at the project and inviting
their participation.

The project was far enough
along so that meetings or neigh-
borhood people were held to dis-
cuss their mutual problems and
possible solutions. Discussion top-
ics ranged 1mm neighborhood rec-
reational sites they would like _to
start in order to keep their chil-
dren on the streets to regulations
on pets. 50 tar Billy has been the
main torce behind organizing and
directing these committee meet-
ings. He is presently trying to find
someone from the neighborhood
willing to assume chairmanship of
the committee. Hecause oi the
community’s historical iailure or
participation in the dcmopratic,
selfrgovernment process, this as-
sumption of the chair by one of
the community is very important.
it means that the committee and
neighborhood improvement can
continue well after Billy's depar-
tul'e.

On first glance the personal visi»
tations, the Saturday work projects
where Grinnell students do odd
jobs fixing houses, etc, and even
the neighborhood meetings may
appear insignificant and even mis-
directed in lighting poverty. But
there is a theory behind all these
activities, The theory is that of
community development, which is
used extensively by the Peace
Corps in fighting poverty abroad.

Essentially there are three stages

Budget Suffers from

To the Editor:

More and more these past years
we have been told how important
higher education is. Every medium
oi intormnticn is hill of sugges
tions to the federal government,
the states, the college themselves.
The individual is being told how
much 5 earning power is in
creased, in terms at dollars and
cents. (What a way of evaluating
education: in my way of thinking
it confuses education with job
training.) I tried to do it myself,
and i hit upon at least one snag
which could easily be avoided'

When my daughter was ready
for college, one at her tcachcrs
rccommended a small college as
excellent, and having just the right
courses of study. The yearly fee
(including entire lite on campus)
appeared rather high iur my bud-
get; but we decided that we should
be just about able to carry it.
Well . . ,

When it came to paying the first
year’s rec, there already was an
increase oi $110; the second year
the increase beyond our original
budget was $235; and for the ncxt
year it will be beyond the original

udget by $375. No doubt there
are good reasons tor the increases;
uniortunately, my budget is in no
way geared to that oi the college
And I am rolling hopelessly behind.
The same dilemma most assurcdly
hits hundreds at thousands of pec-
p_'e who try to solve thcir educa-
tlnual problems alone; and they all
can be spared the disappointment,
and possible unpleasant conse
bounces by some plain, practical
dunking (isn’t that the capacity

To the Editor:
In reply to the letter from “a

am amazed that any parent of a
Griuncll student would be so iii-
senaitive as to take exception to
the impressive issue of the 55:15
which discussed the problem oi
poverty in Grinncll, Des Moines
and Chicago. The stair of the sols
deserves commendation for this
issue, not criticism. and I hope
there will be continucd attention
to the problem. The only cominu

believe along with the parent of

Recently I had an opportunity to inlelylew a lead-

investigative agencies. This particular agency and

on his head.

_ The Grudge Pot

James Blood busied himself with the antique ﬁn-
gemailriile. The handle ended with the golden bust of
Queen Victoria set on a ruby inlaid pedestal, distin-
guishing the tool as a Victorian masterpiece from the
Royal Shops. Blood paused and admired the beauty
of hls pared ringers.

He was careful, as he sat at a table of the popular
London pub, not to cross his legs, (or he knew it
made him look prissy. He was lully conscious of the
tact that a top—notch espionage agent must remain in-
conspicuous — neither proud nor plowed. lie awaited
quietly his drink and the moment that his signal
would call ircm anonymity the other agent, ISL-7.

The drink was his own invention v a James
Bloody Mary. Two jiggers of Walkers, one of any
canned tomato juice, and one of brlefly chilled v.3,
shaken till bruised. with a twist of lemon find.

when the waiter brought the drink, Blood stood
up and slapped it from his hand onto the Hear. “You
peasant," he cursed, “the lemon must be twisted
counter-clockwise!”

Blood did not care about the drlnk but hoped that
the spy hum SMOCK, who had been conspicuously
munching Frims at the bar, would mistake
“counter." as a signal to iorego the rendezvous, Ac-
tually, Blood’s use of his rigllt hand to knock the
drink had indicated that GL7 should walk east from
lhe London Bridge.

As Blood wandered along the leggy banks or the
Thames, he wondered what GL-7 would he like. He
hoped it would be a beautiful girl whom he could se-
duce before his next assignment, but they usually
were rather runty ex-army officers.

Suddenly, he tripped over a bulky object and fell
to the ground. Undoubtedly, it was GL-7, he surmised
as be viewed the motionless heap, A large boot (hen
smashed his skull down onto the cobblestone pave-
ment.

"Harrington's Bootery" was lightly etched on the
bottom of the sole. A slight clue, ll he survived.

“Well, Mr. Blood,” said the voice above, husky
and tinged with a Slavic accent, “you should have
ﬁnished your drink." The enemy's harsh Cockle
seemed incongruous with the pretty London night,

James Blood always struck while they were
laughing. With a great short or his body. he hung
his feet upward at the other's temples, He grabbed
the lat calf and gave a hard twist. he snapped back
to the ground like a bow-string to its place and let
out a huge groan.

The sadistic spy laughed again. He laughed even
harder. When he thought oi the Englishman ruining
himself in his feeble attempt to escape, he wept for
joy. lie doubled over in lmcuntmlluble guffaws, Bass
roars alternated with soprano giggles.

James Blood stood up and brushed his dinner
jacket. The ioggy air bothered his sinuses, and he
had to suppress a sneeze. When the SMOCK agent
was completely prostrate with mirth, Blood pressed
the golden iingernaiHile reluctantly into the left
aurlcle. and the laughter slowly faded. Blood casu-
ally left the scene, knowing that the police would
record the event as a simple mugging in which both
the victim and the culprit were killed.

Now the fog began to lift with the dawn, and the
small bust of Queen Victoria looked silently nttmss

Nine years ago, an alert 5&8
columnist noted the possibility of
small-town trauma among the
newer students at Grinriell, As he
put it. . .

“According to the catalog. Grin-
iiell College is situated in ‘Grinr
nell, a city oi nearly 7000 persons

. about 300 miles west oi Chi-
cago and 50 miles east or Des
Moines.‘ This puts us right in the
middle of nowhere, and it has oc-
curred to me that a new student
from a big City might be confused
by this phenomena at the small
American town,

“For this reason, i thought we
might take a short tour at the
town, while I point out some, of
the more interesting features."

Astute Columnist goes on to give
a royal tour of “downtown” Grin-
nell, which has changed little dur-
ing the intervening years. Thus.

the "square," a solid block of

“After seven pm, on any night
at the week, these cars are driven
by teen-age “soodsLa “seed”
who is trying to be a “hood". . .
They never drive in anything but
second gear, so as to be able to
slow down and stop for any dollie
that might happen to come out
of Davis’ Ice Cream parlor.

“As you walk around the
square, don’t miss the following
attractions. The newstand (Yes-
sir, that's Brownle's very own

last check, they were offering a
wide variety of detective maga-
zines with stories titled ‘Sin,
Scandal, Sex, and Death' and
‘Fourteen Slashes in her Shortie

“The Poweshiek bank, on the

famous architect named Sullivan,
a pioneer in steelrand~concrete

tore, they will not participate in

of Mercer County, NJ.

Miss Bond solicited a write-in

the margin or victory.

Her functions and salary as core

seven maior lines of sportswear they Carry.

Is This Important?

Yes, because sportswear made from naturally

springy wools keeps its shape —— day other day.

Are The Lines?

These lop-rotted sportswear lines are: Pendleton,

White Stag, John Meyer of Norwich, Garland, Tami,

Country Set, and Mr, Thompson. These fine lines are

found only at Poynler‘s in Grinnell.

To the Editor!

I have something to say about
the deoay of the English language,
This past weekend I read about
200 pages of student papers

There is a kind of Gi‘esham's
law of words. Long words drive
out short ones, and with regard
to intellectual coinage. there is a
parallelism to “had money drives
out good money.”

For example, “the Gi-esharriito,"
is i may so call him, says he
“orientates himself in 3 World,"
when there is a simpler, shorter
verb. "to orient oneself." Then he

writes “cl zer," when there is
a word “critic“ And is “analyza-
lion" needed? What’s wrong with
“analysis?"

If a men learned English at 4e,
as did Paul Tillich, then we
should have mercy on his lengths
ened torms such as “resul'recta-
tion" or “salvificntion.” For those
of us who have spoken it in the
nursery and enjoyed the simple
and erteetive speech ol Mother
Goose, the language is lor us to
save. Save it it you can. Damn you
it you can’t.

Play Achieves Dramatic Effect
By Incongruities Between Acts

By MARY MALCOLM

The physlcists, presented last
weekend by the Grinnell Players,
began with a deceptively simple
ﬁrst act taking, in typical Dur-
renmatt form, it grotesquely
shocking twist thereafter,

The performance DI the start-
ling second act took me by wind
as an impressive and highly dra-
matlc departure from the kind of
ﬂoundering hallrsuccess achieved
in the ﬁrst.

The script itsell provides an
ambiguous, ironical farce in the
ﬁrst act as the foundation of an
entirely ditlerent kind at drama
in the second. The Physicists, as
it ﬁnds expression in the second
act, is a powerful, almost over-
stated comment on the useless sil~

The dichotomy and total ab»
sauce of continuity between hrs:

effective. It demonstrates the au-
thor’s almost too simple concern
with the normal appearance or a
very sick world. We cannot ask
the director to instill something
in a play purposely omitted by
the playwright, so Denms Rich
deserves rather more credit than
criticism tor the abrupt change
in the tone of the acting between
these two acts. Nevertheless, it is

ﬁned characters, by the gilt of

those portrayed by Miss Tinker

Stepping hack into the very
different kind of job done in act
one, i realize that I reacted more
as critic tlhan audience, and justly
so. There was some poor acting
done, coupled with opening night’s
nervous slips and sturterings.

Seven lettermen, tour of them
starters and a fifth a semi-reg»
ular a year ago, return for the
196566 basketball season at Grin-
nell, but also on hand is the same
problem that plagued the Pioneers
last winter.

Once again, the Pioneers lack
height and rebounding power. None
of the pioneers who are expected
to see heavy action top 631/2 and
only ﬁve of them are taller than

The shortest team in the Mid~
west conference last year, the Plo-
neers finished with a 7-15 record,
Their 5.13 loop mark dropped them
into a cellar tie with Monmouth.

“We will be giving away a lot
at height in virtually every game
again this year." notes Coach John
Pfitsch, "but we will have better
overall height than last season. We
should be able to put two or three
pretty good board men under the
basket and hope to do a more et-

fective
year.”

“We should also have better
depth than in 196465,” according to
Pfitsch, “I feel that we can put
any of ll) or 11 boys on the floor at
any time without being hurt." Last
winter, Pfitsch was forced to go

The returning lettermen are Jeff
Frantz, Elliott Hibbs, Tom Hill,
and Tom Risser, all starters a
year ago, Bob Watt, a semi-regular
in 1964-65, and Dick Lowell, and
Dan Markman. Frantz, a 6-2 sen-
ior, excells in every phase at the
game — scoring, rebounding, de-
fense, and flour play. He received
first team all—conference recogni-
tion last season and rewrote a con-
siderable portion of the school rec-
ord book, setting season standards
with his 509 points, 208 field goals,
and 23.1 average, and claiming sin~

Hibbs and Hill, a pair oi juniors?
tallied 286 and 273 points, respec<
tively, a year ago for 13.0 and 12.3

with 136. Kisser had a 7.3 average;
Watt a 3.4 average,

Wrestlers Face ‘Build'

Back as Grinnell wrestling coach
atter a two-year hitch in the Peace
Corps, Terry Moore has only rour
lettermen returning from last
year’s Pioneer team which posted
a 6-5 dual meet mark and placed
third in the Midwest Conference
meet.

Sophomores fill all but one of the
other spots on the lZ—man squad.
Six oi the newcomers are expected
to earn regular status.

“This has to be classed as a
building year for us,” according
to Moore. “As has been customary
with Grinnell wrestling teams, we
don’t have much depth. With only
one boy at most weight classes,
we Will really be in trouble if any
ct them are hurt. But, we have the

makings of a respectable team and
hope to win our share or dual
meets and finish in the confer-
ences's first division.”

The returning vets are Bill
Barnes. 123; Ken Strubler, 130;
Gary Wilson, 160; and Bob Geller,
17].

Two or the toughest little guys
in the conference, Barnes and
Strubler have already earned
places among Grinnell's mat
greats.

Barnes, the deiending loop titlist
at 123, won 12 of 15 matches a
year ago, including eight in a row
at the end of the campaign. He
placed second in the league the
previous year.

Third in the league as a sopho-

ing Year'

more and second last winter, Stru<.
bler boasts a 27764 record for his
two years of action.

A late addition to the team last
year, Wilson lost only once in six‘
appearances and placed third in
conterence competition. Geller was
214. He frequently wrestled at lei,
where he gave away considerable
weight.

The sophomore contingent is
rated as Grinneli’s most talented.
in at least three years. Sopho<
mores who are expected to claim
iull time jobs are Mike Martinson,
115; Joel Richman, 137; John‘
Sharpe, 145; Ray Mendel, 152;
Lou Kelley. 167; and Lee Roth-
stein, 191.

There are no heavyweights on
the squad.

 

Swimmers' Problem-Shallowness

Grinnell, which boasted one of
its deepest swimming teams in his
tory last year, will iieid one oi its
shallowest this time around.

Thirteen mermen were consistent
point getters in 1964—65 as the Pio-
neers won eight of nine dual meets
and placed third in the Midwest
Conference outing. This season,
Coach Irv Simone has only four of
them back — Ken Adelman, Bill
Batschelet, Richard Lance and Bill
Lontz. All four are juniors. There
isn’t a single senior on the nine-
man squad.

The top returnee is Adelman, a
butteriiy specialist who cracked
both the school and pool marks four
times a year ago. He lowered Grin-
nell’s 20~yard pool record to 2:125
and notched a school standard of
2210.1 at Carleton’s 25-yard pool.
Unbeaten in dual meet competition,
he placed third in the conference

 

Selected as the most improved
swimmer on last year's team,
Lontz Claimed the number two
spot in the conference in the 50-
yard freestyle. He was also a
mainstap on the freestyle relay
quartet.

Lance, who doubles as a diver
and sprinter, concentrated on the
iormer event a year ago, held down
the number one spot for the Pin-
neers, and ranked among the loops
top performers. Because of the
lack of depth this year, he will
probably be called on in the
sprint events too.

Batschelet is tabbed for duty in
both the 200- and Evil-yard free-
style events.

Rounding out the squad are five
sophomores — Bruce Austin. Steve
tIoltze, Richard Seifcrt, Robert
Wells, and Eric Vail,
