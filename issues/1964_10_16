Open House

Sometime this weekend the Dean of the College
,Will issue a letter to students defining the particulars
of the college Open House program as it has been
worked out by administration and student leaders and
approved by the Board of Trustees. We would like to
take this early opportunity to commend the Dean and
all who worked on the program. The Open House pro-
‘gram not onlycseeks to satisfy all the various college in~
terests, but it also seeks to establish a criterion by
.which students can measure their freedom. We feel it
'does this, and that much of the success in this program
will stem from the fact that it has been the result of
go-operative effort on the part of both students and ad-
ministration who have responsibly merged divergent

needs in seeking the solution to a particular dilemma.

Double Welcome

*

Only once this year, but it will be a weekend to rev
member. This time we welcome not only moms and
dads but also the grads — recent and not so recent. It‘s
a weekend to look forward to even if it does mean that
you have to stand in line fifteen minutes longer for Sat—
urday night Saga steaks — but they may be better than
usual.

The campus is festive; all week they've been
mowing the grass arid smoothing out the mounds of dirt
which have so far somewhat hidden from view the not-
quite-finished Forum. Amid the color of homecoming
mums and festivities of the game and the dance will
be, the meeting of parents and greeting old friends who
have journeyed back to their Alma Mater,

The little tang of louesomeness in those of us whose
parents could not make the trip will not last long, for
we will share the happiness of seeing our friends with
their families and knowing that the college life is at
least a little more meaningful for the entire family.

And We can be reassured that this life is something
of value when we see again those who have “escaped”
to the real world, yet find it worth their while to come
back to Grinnell to see old friends and familiar places.

Combining Homecoming and Parents Weekend,
then, seems not only to give us a weekend contact with

i the real world while we are on campus, but also to say
to us that the real world thinks we’re doing something
good here — at least something worth a journey and a
crowded, hectic, yet very enjoyable weekend, to visit.

We hope that not only the guests but the college
community enjoy themselves, and that it will be a
'weekcnd to remember, pleasantly

Dear Editor:

My penetrating observations
on campus immaturity were
definitely confirmed by two lete
ters in last week's SELB. In this
present letter I shall answer
charges made by Paul R.
Jones, ‘68, while incorporating
the letter of Mr. A. Youthful
Upperclassman into my proof.
Jones assaults my letter for
three reasons,

Though Jones disagrees, the
enlightened ircslimen do view
the campus as being immature.

Jones tags my letter as im-
mature and thus fails to per-
ceive the scope of my inten-
tions, Its purpose is far greater
than Jones realizes. Mr. Jones,
reread my letter.

My convictions are strong,
but “the innocent humor” of
the prepping program necessi
tates anonymity. Fear. the
force that moved Jonathan

 

Swift, Anonymous, and Alexan-
der Pope to cloak their true
identities, also intimidates me.

in the concluding portion of
this letter, I wish to offer other
examples of immaturity. Mr.
A. Youthful Upperclassman’s
letter is the epitome of imma-
turity. upperclassmen immatur»
ily. AYU‘s defense of the prep-
ping program is illogical arid
absurd — adjectives that chain
actcrlze the program itself.
AYU speaks of “lifelong cam-
airaclerie," but who wants to be
friends with irrational sadisls
who release their lrustrauons
on innocent freshmen. Also
are the $40,000 Worth of books
stolen from the library ”merely
innocent exuberances?” Every
line of this classic exhibits a
similar irresponsible attitude.
One can easily dismiss thi
“youthful” letter. .

Several students at Grinnell

savage irresponsibility and have

disregard for college property.
These students, not being happy
With the color and condition of
the paint on the walls of their
rooms, have repainted their
walls! It’s true. They actually
went downtown and bought
paint and brushes, went back to
their rooms, and (probably in
the dead of night) spent five
or six hours painting their
walls. The colors of these new-
ly painted rooms are, admit-
tedly, almost in keeping with
our fine college standards:
light blue. white. and beige are
the colors in the rooms with
which I am familiar. But this,
of course, is irrelevant. Neither
is it important that the walls
have been improved, nor that
the students have used their
own money and taken their own
time to make their rooms a
little more desirable. We also
must not consider the fact that

a student. None or these things
are important. The important
thing is that students are, in
general, a very destructive and
irresponsible g r o u p. They
should be punished as often as
possible when they step out. of
line. A lot of times this pun-
ishment, for one reason or an-
other, cannot be carried out
properly, but in at. least two of
the "room painting episodes"
our wonderfully efficient and
just Buildings and Grounds De-
partment has hit upon a beauti-
in] and appropriate punish
ment: they are going to re
paint Lhe repainted rooms and,
naturally, send the bills, to the
guilty students. (And, in at
least one case, they are going
to repaint the walls the same
color the student has painted
them). Can't you just imagine
the smiles over the physical
plant when they mail out the
bills? “Boy, wait’ll they see
these bills. That’ll fix ’em." It’s
easy to imagine their satisfac-
tion. And so, if in your hall
there is a leaking water pipe
or a pluggedrup sink, you’ll
have to wait a while before it's
fixed: 5&6 is in the punish-
merit business these days.

Oedipus Rex Uses
Traditional Dress,
Greek Palace Set

The title role in Oedipus Rex,
the Greek tragedy which will
be produced in Roberts Thea-
ter November 1244, will be
played by Walter Lowe. Mar-
garet Weathers will play Jocas-
ta, his wife. Other principal
parts will be played by Charles
Burns, Maxwell Helfolt, Ric

‘Macoowell, Dan Mason. Terry

McCoy and Burt McDowell,

”I've felt for a long time that
we should do a Greek tragedy,”
director Mr. Richard Meyer,
Said. “This is the first in a
long Lime at Grinnell, and we’re
deliberately doing it in a some-
_what traditional pattern.”

The play will be done in tra-
ditional Greek costume, and the
set will suggest a Greek palace.
Assistant director is John How-
ard and Karen Hardy is mak—
ing all costumes.

A large chorus, directed by
Mrs. Robert Voertman, will
dance as well as speak. They
will tentatively be accompanied
by a single flute.

More than 70 students tried
out for places in the cast, Mr.
Meyer said, and 95% of the
cast are freshmen and sopho»
mores.

Walter Lowe, who will play
Oedipus, is a freshman from
Chicago, Illinois. At Parker
High School in Chicago he had
the lead in fifteen plays and di-
rected three. Although he has
never played Greek tragedy,
he has seen four portrayals of
Oedipus Rex.

“Oedipus is a man of stark
arrogance, often moved to an-
ger," Lowe said. “He does not
like to he disagreed with I'll
play him as a man who’s al-
ways right, until he finds out
that has completely wrong.
We have a very solid Cast, and
everyone is eager. It should
make for an exciting perform<

Bayli: Greatest Battle is for Men' 5 Minds

By Ann Showalter

Senator Birch Bayh of In-
gana climaxed Democratic

ay events Tuesday with his
peech, “The Great Society—At

omo and Abroad,” at the 8
.mi rally in Darby Gym.

”We cannot solve the prob
lems of the space age with stone
rgc mentality,” Bayh declared.
‘We have to decide whether we

9 going to accept Lyndon
ohnson’s challenge—to contin~
he to build the Great Society."

He sketched the three main
’goals of the Great Societyi
equal opportunity for everyone
in America, gradual disarma-
ment, and winning the support
of emerging nations. He ex—
plained how he feels the Ad
ministration and the Congress
have been moving toward
these goals and how the pres
ent Republican leadership has
worked against them,

“The right of equal opportun-
ity is the right of every Amer-
can boy and girl to dream and
to make their dreams come
true because they work for
them,” Bayh stated.

He feels America has moved
closer to achieving the Great
Society at home during the last
four years. He cited bills passed

 

by the Eightyrelghth Congress
providing increased vocational
education funds for college
classrooms, libraries and equip-
ment and loan programs for
prospective doctors, dentists
and nurses. _

Bayh praised the American
arms program because “its
aim is to protect the peace, not
to wage war.” He hopes for a
gradual reduction in the need
for arms until “the day when
man will sit down and talk
about their problems instead of
shooting them out.”

The junior senator from In-
diana said there was no bill
he felt more honored to vote
for than the ratification of the
nuclear test ban treaty. “This
is not the panacea,” he ad-
mitted, “but it is the first time
man has had the power to de-
stroy the world that he has
voted to limit this power.” He
pointed out that Senator Barry
Goldwater opposed the treaty.

He also criticized the Repub-
lican candidate’s opposition to
the "hot line” between White
House and Kremlin. “Anyone
who has read Fail-Safe or seen
Dr. Strangelove realizes there
is a chance the hot line could
prevent accidental nllclear dis-
aster," he said.

 

Bayli believes, ‘Only one man
Should be entrusted with the fi-
nal say in the use of the weap»
Oils in our arsenal, and that
man is the President of the
United States.” Thus he op-
poses Goldwater's plan to en-
trust the field commanders
with the authority to launch tac—
tical nuclear weapons.

According to Bayh, however,
the greatest problem we face
is not that of armed conflictl
The real battle is the battle
for men’s minds,"

He elaborated, ‘The emergv
ing nations must choose be-
tween the freedom we offer and
the shackling of mind and body
by the Communists,"

He suggested there is a close
relationship between our abil-
ity to solve problems within our
country and our ability to win
the “minds and hearts of these
awakening men."

“They are looking at us and
they are looking at the Rue
sians,” he declared, “and it is
up to us to present America,
the Great Society, in a manner
that will spread the cause of
freedom."

Stressing the “need for dis
content,” Bayl-l quoted Edmund
Burke: “All that is needed for
evil to prevail in the world is

issue of Campaign Is Candidates'
Judgement in Nuclear War Realm

By Lynn Denzler

Senator Birch anh, visiting
politician - in - residence, stated
before a student press confer
ence Tuesday afternoon that the
big issue in this year’s presi-
dential campaign c o n c e r n s
which man has the better judg-
ment in determining the actions
that a president might need to
take in the realm of nuclear
war.

The indiana Democrat made

the statement in contradicting
an analysis offered last week by
another visitor, Senator Peter
H. Dominick (ll-Colo), who
Said that he felt the issue of
the campaign concerned cena
tralizatlon of government.
- Bayh said that he would con-
sider centralization far down
the line of issues “if it is an is-
sue at all” and he went on to
speak of the quality of judgment
in the candidates.

“The question isn't that
Goldwater wants to start a war,
and Johnson doesn’t,” he said.
“Actually neither does” The
youthful freshman Senator con-
tinued by saying that the appar-
ent inconsistencies in the stands
that Republican candidate Bar-
ry M, Goldwater takes in his
speeches come from the fact
that he is not as well versed 0n
the issues as he should be.

“His statements are those of
a man who doesn’t use respon-
sible judgment before he talks.
You Can call it hipeshooting if
you want," the Senator re—
marked in answer to a student
query.

When asked about the appar—
ent Democratic attempt to cov»
er up the Bobby Baker scandal
for political reasons, the Senna
tor outlined Specific moves that
have been made by the admin-
istration to investigate the sub

ject. Bayh stated that he him.=
“violated

self felt that Baker
good conscience when he ped-
dled influence. No one in the
Senate Condones this,” he said.
He was critical however of
those who would make a pol";
icul football out of such a Situa-
Lion.

“The Republicans Want to
make the Bobby Baker issue a
big thing, but I have yet to' see
his name on any ballot.” Bayh
said.

While speaking on this sub-
ject the Senator said that he
would support the establish-
mcni of a code of ethics de-

 

signed for‘membets of the Sen-
ate.

“This is a serious thing to all
those who want government of
great respect,” he told the stu—
dents, “How can we get young
people lik‘e'iyou to come into
government when others have
tried to tear it down.”

As a freshman senator, he
has been called a “rebel" by
members of his party for stands
he has taken against the ad-
ministration-supported bills. In‘
defending his voting record,
Bayh emphasized that he felt
each senator should vote ac-
cording to what he believed
were the best interests of the
country.

When asked about the prob-
lems of agriculture, Bayh said
that he felt the Republican pro»
posals were completely Inade<
quate. “Taking the federal gow
ernment out of agriculture with
a snap at your fingers will only
create chaos,” he continued.

He further recognized that
some definite improvements
are needed by the administra-
tion in this area. “What is
needed is a long range answer
and not stop—gap proposals,” he
said.

Returning to the problem of
the president’s responsibility in
determining possible nuclear
war Bayh stated that he felt the
president is the only qualified
man to make such a choice. He
emphasized that reason is
needed today more than ever
before and said, “It takes a
bigger man to reason than it
does to bluster."

When asked about the results
of the so-called “White back-
lash" on the November voting
returns, the Senator felt that
many other issues would be
more important when the filial
time to vote arrives, He further
felt that peaceiul Civil Rights
demonstration, like any other,
was part of a sacred right for
any group, but added thut vio—
lence in this area, which we
have had, is detrimental l0 ulli-
mate accomplishment,"

Bayh was quick to admit that
the United States Was not win-
ning in Viet Nam, but could
not offer an answer to the prolr
lem. He talked about the two
apparent alternatives, to wage
all out combat for Victory, or
to pull out entirely, as inilile~
quate, and said that the U. S.
was going to have to atij st
what she has been doing in or-
der to iind another solution.

US. Population Suffers Assault On Eardrums

Have you noticed? It’s get~
ting noisier.

Already the world's noisiest
nation, the United States has
suffered a steady assault on
its citizens’ eardrums. Sound

levels have increased an esti-
mated one decibel yearly for
the last thirty years. Those
thirty decibels represent about

: one-fourth the level of sound

that can cause permanent dam-
age to the ears. Moreover, an
article in me October Read—
er’s Digest points out the rate
of increase is climbing and the
din is expected to rise even
more sharply in the future.

One main reason for the rac-
ket is that along with popula-
tion growth we are experi-
encing a proliferation of ma-
chines, The average suburban
home may reverberate to as
many as twenty different mo-
tors ranging from automobile
to air conditioner.

Scientists attempting to stem
the rising tide of noise are
meeting a surprising obstacle—
reluctance of us consumers to
give up the image of power
created by sound.

earsplitters. They can be made
far less noisy at little cost. But
when one manufacturer tried it
some years ago, his sales
dropped. The reason: custom-
ers felt that the less noisy mo~
tors had less power.

The converse reason explains
why any kid converting an old
car to a “hot rod" makes it a
first step to remove the muf—
tier.

Similar feelings on the part of
consumers have prevented au-
tomobile manufacturers and
makers of refrigerators from
making their products quieter.
Many of us find a good secure
feeling in the sound of an au-
thoritative clunk.

There is no question that
noise annoys. Studies indicate
that Workers in offices and fac-
tories with high noise levels
have more personal conflicts—
at home and at work—than
those in quieter surroundings.
Mounting lawsuits and com-
plaints also attest to the noise
created furore.

 

Science is doing its part to
help quiet things down. To al~

ers will have 'to abandon

War's Role in West's Civilization Underestimated.
Deeply Involved in at Least Three Social Aspects

By Douglas McCormac

“The role that war has
played in Western civilization
usually is underestimted—
even at Grinnell College,"
claimed Homer-Norton (hist.)
in Wednesday night’s Faculty
Discussion Series examination
of “The Historical and Legal
Aspects of Nuclear War and
Disarmament" With William
,Vanderpool (speech and the-
atre), who talked on the legal
problems of nuclear war, Mr.
Norton led the second in a
series of discussions sponsored

by the Board of Religion on the
general topic, “Nuclear War
and its Alternatives: Moral and
Ethical Implications,"

War is deeply involved in our
Western society in at least
three aspects, making the his-
tory of atomic war “a sticky
package,” Norton saidr War
traditionally has been an in-
strument of political power, a
means and a force in creating
and improving technology, and
a factor for promoting organi-
zation within a state.

Cole: War Paradoxical Situation
Starts Board of Religion Series

A high standard of excellence
and controversy was set for
[his semester’s faculty discus-
sion series on nuclear war by
Richard Cole (Phil). This ser-
ies, sponsored by the Board of
Religion, was initiated on Oct.
_7 with Cole’s discussion Of
"War's Humanity.”

Cole began by emphasizing
the paradoxical nature of war.
It is the only human institution,
he said, which contains both
the base and. the noble, the
ignominious and the grand. It
is a duality which combines
honor, dignity and Virtue with
the lowest forms of bestiality.
He urged the attempt to under-
stand this paradox, which is
the heart of the human condi-
tion, rather than a passive and
cynical acceptance of it.

Cole pointed out that man is
the only animal that accepts
war as part of its social ac:
livities, Animals fight, but this
is not the organized, vicious
struggle of “civilized" man’s
war. .

”A noble imagination” is
able to envision the end of war-
fare, Cole grants. However, he
pointed out that all important
Eolitical unions have been
uiit upon 'the force of war and
maintained through police force
of some kind.

Drawing conclusions which

 

from members of the audience,
Cole discussed the psycholog-
ical implications of war at con-
siderable length. He Said that
war fills a need in man's life
— a need to prove his courage
and provide an outlet for his
”spirited element." There is;
according to Cole, a need in
man for a life which is rational
but courageous. There is a use
and a need for violence. Lite
could exist without war, but; it
very likely would not be worth
living. Cole offered an incom~
plete conception of a possible
"higher warfare” which would
fill this need without bloodshed.
This would not, he said, be a
substitute, but a higher ’de-
velopment of man‘s spirited
element. , ,

During a heated discussion
period which followed Cole’s
talk, several other aspects of
his point of view were brought
out. Courage, he said is the
willingness to face death for

certain goalsTAlthough he is a‘

firm believer in the search for
peace, he claims it is ignoble
to seek peace through fear, for
this is showing a lack of cour-
age. Although he agreed that
war is rarely justifiable on

moral grounds, his ultimatei
view seemed to be that it is}

necessary or inevitable as long
as man has purposes and the
courage to see them through.

when we are forced to make
value judgments and sacrifice
for others while trying to
achieve our personal goals at

is the simplest yet the most pro-
found of educators, The world
is composed of artists, law~
yers, doctors, and engineers,
but the most respected men in
the professions are often those
with the most acute understand-
ing of themselves and society.
The goal of our four'years at
Carleton is that whatever pro-
fession we choose, our experi-
ence here will somehow magic-
ally transform us into better
people, I have yet to meet this
wise and potent magician.

indicated that Carleton is not
yet the kind of college where
this personal and social growth
can be best fostered. But the
possibility for it does exist and
we, the student body, can play a
major role in making Carleton
a better college. We are small
enough to make the concept of
a community practicable yet
large enough to provide a hete-
rogeneous and exciting group of
people. We must be our own

magician.

IF WE ARE TO GROW as
people and not just as students
we lnust CDnSlde!‘ ourselves as
part of a community, a group
of individuals who consent to
work together, Any community
must be built on trust and mu-
tual respect, something more
than the high regards of a stu-
dent for a knowledgeable prae
fessor or of a professor for an
excellent student. Our commu-
nity must be broad enough to
include different interests as
well as different viewpoints.

What Carleton needs most is
a group of students willing to

 

recognize the validity if not the
wisdom of college policies, stu-
dents with high ideals Willing to
spend the time and effort to
turn their ideals into practice,
and above all, students who are
willing to work with each other
and with the administration. We
must convince the faculty and
the administration that we are
capable of forming college pol-
icy as well as voicing our pro-
test. We must be militant when
the need arises. we must con-
tinue to make our presence felt.
But if we are serious about
what we are saying we must do

new ideas that will accomplish
what we’re after and satisfy the

A special Student-Faculty»Ad—
ministration Council Chaired
jointly by President Nason and
by the CSA President, is now
discussing ways in which stu-
dent government can play a
larger role in the college, Our
student government must be
prepared to assume greater re—
sponsibility. CSA committees
should investigate the curricu-
lum, the grading system and
whatever other areas pose
problems, They must work
closely with administration and
faculty groups. While our past
experience has shown that we
can work for change successful-
ly, we have also learned that
success Wlll not come unless all
three campus factions agree to
act together, to share a trust in
each other and to believe that
change can mean progress.

AT THE PRESENT TIME
our student government is
weak. Individual students acts

‘ ing through CSA have been able

to accomplish a surprising
amount but the student govern-
ment itself is almost powerless.
The big decisions on the campus
are made Without its participa-
tion. There are several things
we can do on our own within
CSA to make it better but our
main task will be to prove to
the administration that we are
capable of making a greater
and more Vital contribution to
the maintenance and develop»
ment of the college. This year
more than ever before our sucs
cesses and failures will indicate
the role we will play in college
government.

Soccer Team
Defeated 4-2

The Grinnell soccer team suf-
ferred its first defeat last week-
end at the feet of MacMurray
College, 42. The first quarter
was slow but Grinnell dominat;
ed play. Chilingulo scored 21

cal early in the period but
grinnell failed to tally again in

he quarter. MacMurray ral-
lied somewhat in the second
quarter and scored two goals
While holding Grinnell score-
less. The first goal was on a
penalty kick awarded for use
of hands. Goalie Kaufmann had
been incapacitated earlier in

e the play, forcing fullback Ros—
enbaum to make a desperation
stop of a Maclviurray goal at-
tempt with his hands.

The MacMurray team came

n strong in the third quarter

ut Grinnell held them score-
ess. In the final period Mac-

urrey pressed their attack
and scored two goals. Grinnell
tallied somewhat and scored
once on a deflected shot by
Rinku. Tho final score. +2 Mac-
urray.

In general Grinnell did not

lay an aggressive, hard chal-
enging game. They failed to
game their opportunity early in
he first quarter and thus lot

MacMurray rally in later per-
lods. One must not take any-
thing away from the MacMur-
ray team. Their tight defense
oontained the Grinnell eIEVen

Pioneer Victory 0ver Monmouth
Highlighted By Offensive Running

by Kris Nash

The Grinnell Pio n a ers
notched their second victory of
the football season last Satur-
day as they rolled past Mon-
mouth College 42-0. The game
marked the first time in three
outings that Grinnell’s back-
field speed and running ability
have lived up to its potential.
A combination of good blocks
and determined running a-
massed 307 yards rushing for
the Pioneers Added to the
typically potent passing of
quarterbacks Barry Anderson
and Denny Hanssen (ll of 21
complete for 144 yards), this of-
fensive overwhelmed the Fight-
lng Scots, who were able to
muster only 77 yards overall.

The Pioneer defense, in post
ing its second consecutive shut-
out, smothered the Monmouth

deep and often. Ons expects a
more spirited showing from the
Grinnell team in this weekend’s
home contest with Shimer Col-
lege (soccer field at 12:00).

attack efficiently enough that
more attention could be focused
upon Grinnell’s offensive prob-
lems. In the opening loss to Ri-
pon, numerous offensive mis-
takes which might have been
corrected, continued to cast the
Pioneers yards because coach-
es were forced to devotevtheir
attention to tightening a porous
secondary.

It was a far more aggressive
and effective defense that faced
the Scots, intent upon the idea
of a shut-out from the first. The
Grinnell line limited Monmouth
to 11 rushing yards and the soo-
ondary allowed them only 68 in
the air, with halfback Chip
Clarke making two of four in—
terceptionsl

The Pioneers lost a scoring
opportunity in the first period
when Monmouth defender Jim
Pilarski picked off a pass at
his own goal line Grinnell
came back with a SECDnd'quaF

vter drive that saw Hanssen

break the scoring ice with a 1-
yard sneak. Shortly thereafter
end Mike Dewitt grabbed a 15-

 

yard toss from Anderson to put
the Pioneers in front at half-
time 14-0.

Playing before a large and
enthusiastic h o m e co min g
crowd, Monmouth was reluc-
tant to submit, but a fake field
goal attempt with Anderson
again firing to Dewitt brought
Grinnell a single third-period

score. A similar play, though

unplanned, added a two-point
conversion.

In the fourth quarter Grin—
nell’s superior strength and
ability wore down the Scots and
produced a three - touchdown
barrage. Sophomore halfback
Bob Watt tallied on jaunts of 11
and five yards, but reserves
Bob Geller and John Kelsey
staged the most sensational
play of the day. Geller inter-
cepted a Monmouth aerial with
5:32 left in the game and
Instead of going down, later-
alled off to the nearby Kelsey
who scempered 25 yards to
score.

End Dave Gauger closed the
Storing by booting his fourth
extra point of the afternoon. In
addition to a 32—yard field goal,
Gouger has been successful on
five of seven conversion at-
tempts, with his only failures
coming on a blocked kick and
an errant center-snap.

Though they did not score,
backs John Shierholz, Elston
Bowers, and Marty Ringo were
the central figures in the Pio-
neer ground game with their
tough and elusive running.

 

Harriers to Run in
Inter-Squad Meet

Coach Dick Young‘s cross
country runners will take a
breather from intercollegiate
competition this weekend with
an intrarsquad meet. Scheduled
for 1:50 pm. Saturday at Ward
Field, the meet will match the
varsity and freshmen and will
precede the Homecoming Par-
enis’ Day football game.

The four varsity runners —
Bruce Beckord, Steve Brint—
nail, Andy Bushnell, and Clyde
Smith — will be joined by Galen
Bollinger, a sophomore trans
fer, who has been running with
the frosh.

The fresh team will be com-
posed of John Sharp, Bob
Grant, Doug Dray, Ric Mac-
Dowell, Darrell Dunham, Steve
Hunt, Jon Bilstrom, and Rich
LaFontaine.

Despite the loss of it top two
runners, Capt. Paul Patterson
and Rod Brown, the varsity
crew has won its last two
meets. After capping their third
straight Les Duke Invitational
crown two weeks ago, tho Pim
nears defeated Monmouth 23-31
in a dual last Saturday though
having only four runners.
Beckord, Brlntnall, Bushnell,
and Smith came in second,
third, fourth, and fifth in the
latter meet to offset the autor
matic 10th place points Grinnell
was assessed for not having a
full team.

crowd here tomorrow at 2 pm.
on Ward Field.

Since dropping their opener
to Ripon, the league co-leader
and defending champion, the
Pioneers have whitewashed
Knox iii-0 and Monmouth 42-0.
The 42 points the Scarlet and

against Knox and has been so
successful the past two weeks.
The probable starting offen-
sive lineup has Dave Gauger
and Dewitt or Al Peterson at
end; Rein Sal‘al and Eric Mil-
ler at tackle; Jeff Lewis and
Rick Anderson at guard: Mor-
gan Michel at center; Ander-
son at quarterback; Bowers
and Shierholz at halfback; and
Ringo at fullback. Watt is again
tagged for heavy duty at half-
back and Denny Hanssen will
back up Anderson at quarter-
back.

>On defense, Bowers will go
With Dewitt, Tom Hill and Chip
Kinsey at the two end spots;
Skip Weyrauch and Denny Ho-
merin at tackles; Pete Staben
or Mike Miller at middle guard;
Tom Lannom and Paul Thurs-
ton as linebackers; and Dave
Synhorst, Chip Clarke, Watt.
and Hanssen in the backfield.

"MARTY CHURCH, Prop.”

 

Al
F r

By Dick Lovell

The final score was Clark 76, West 6, When these
results were announced, reactions spread around the
campus with amazing rapidity. Many comments echoed
the theme that Clark Hall was point-hungry, sadistic
and had lost sight of the purpose of intramural football.
It is interesting that most of the remarks came from
people who hadn‘t even seen, let alone played in, the
game. Other accusations hurled at the Clark team were
largely froln the West team itself. These were, in ef-

fect, that Clark has some guys who play too rough. The-
1crux of the whole series of anathemas being cast upon

the Clark team, and the hall itself is that they areﬁ‘too
childish” and that they want to “win at all cost.”

As a participant in the debacle, I would like first
of all to give an explanation of some of the factors
which contributed to the score. First the Clark team
was hot — everything we did turned out right at first
We received all the breaks and built up a demoralizing
lead early in the game. Then came a series of incidents
which precipitated our extra effort during the rest of
the game. First, West disputed a referee‘s decision and
announced that they were protesting the game. (score
at the time: 25-0). Still angry and frustratedhthey re-
peatedly “flared-up” in anger over referee’s decisions,
hard blocks, and anything else they could think of.
When they did score, it was set up by a trick play
exactly similar to one for which Navy coach Wayne
Hardin was publicly reprimanded last year, because it
was termed unsportsmanlike. With this added incen-
tive, Clark “childishly” played as hard as possible un-
til halftime.

From this point on, I think the final result Was as
much West’s doing as Clark’s. Not content with losing
the ball on downs in the second half, West began re-
turning kickoffs by deliberately kicking the ball back
to us without even running one scrimmage play. Ques-
tion: It is more childish to give up or to continue play-
ing your best?

With Clark’s bench long since cleared early in
the last quarter, a,West senior at least three inches tall-
er and ten pounds heavier than his Clark opponent
(who was a substitute freshman) drew back to punch
him after a whistle, When another Clark man re-
strained him by holding him, he was threatened by
more West players.

Clark could have settled things through fisticuffs,
deliberate injuring, whining, or griping. We chose the
”childish” way, though —— scoring touchdowns;

Obviously, the entire blame for the atrocious score
cannot be fixed on either the winner or the loser. The
desire to “run it up” was there, I admit. However, it is
every bit as hard to lose a game 76-6 in this league as

it is to win one.

ASC Hears Speech
0n Testing Drugs

By Judith Wallace

Mr. Garland Reed of the
Food and Drug Administration
outlined the procedures and
problems of testing new drugs
in an address to the Grinnell
Chapter of the American Chem-
ical Society Wednesday night.

”The greatest surge" of new
’drugs has come in the past few
years, according to Mrl Reed.
,This has contributed greatly to
man’s benefit: — but has also
opened new possibilities of
harm. The increasing complex-
ity of drugs has made their
testing more difficult, he said.

The Pure Food and Drug Acts
have prohibited the adultera-
tion or mislabeling of drugs.
In 1962 the Kefauver-Harris
Amendments added the require-
ment that a drug be effective
as claimed when used as pre-
scribed, as well as safe.

With the anew application
forms, the FDA requires sub-
mission of full reports on all in-
vestigations, quantitative listing
of the drug’s components, and
full reports on methods and
controls in the manufacture and
storage of the drug. Samples
and the proposed label are also
called for.

The responsibility rests with
the drug’s makers to prove it
safe and effective to the satis—
iaction of the FDA, Inadequate
testing, lack of evidence of ef<
fectiveness and false or mis—
leading labeling are grounds
for refusing certification.

After the drug has been
marketed the FDA’s interest in
it continues. Under previous
legislation, the manufacturer
had no responsibility to save or
iorward reports of adverse ef-
fects caused by their drug.
Now, they are required to file
complete reports of further
testing and of reactions to the
drug. The FDA judges decide
whether the drug should con—
tinue without change, requires
a change in labeling, or should
be withdrawn from the mar-
ket Failure to report is suf-
ficient for the drug’s withdraw-
al,

The Kefauver amendments
also'set up an extended time
limit by which the FDA must
act on the drug Formerly, if
no action had been taken at the
end of so days. the drug was
automatically considered ap-
proved. Now the FDA must act,
although the manufacturer is
given the right to appeal their
decision to a federal court.

D e s p i t e the formidable
amount of testing required even
before a drug ls cleared for
testing on humans, it is almost
impossible to determine all of
a drug’s potential effects. Re-
actions vary widely with the

graduate of Grinnell. Mr. MC-
Blain's role in East and West
is the beginning of a projected
plan by the administration to
have whet might best be called
“faculty residents" in each of

Ideally. these residents would

Three members of the Eng-

a book, “A Preface to Literary
Analysis,” just: published by
Scott, Foresman and Company
Chicago, ‘

Sheldon P. Zitner, James D.
Kissane, and Myron Mr Liber-
man have, according to the
foreword of their 140 -page
book, “tried to present some
of the distinctions and skills
necessary in literary ahalysis.”

After describing the uses of
literature and its three major
kinds — lyric, narrative, and
drama — the book goes on to
discuss “close reading." appli-
cations to speciﬁc works, and
the premises of literary criti-
clsm.

_Prof, Grad Publish

James Kissane (English)
concluded a two-year term as
president of the Iowa Colleges
Conference on English at the
organization’s annual meeting
held Oct. 2-3 at Morningside
College, Sioux City.

Henry-York Steiner (English)
presented a paper, “Students

in Perception." at the meeting.

“I pretty well hibernated dur-
ing my senior year. I had a
double major in physics and
math; two comprehensivee to
study for, and l was gone sev-
eral weekends looking over job
offers."

McBlain’s current job, for-
mer education at Grinnell and
youthful appearance have ai<
forded him a few amusing inci-
dents. A few weeks ago as the
forming outside
Cowles at dinner time, an irate
senior, possibly remembering
him vaguely but nontheless cone
fusing him with some illustrious
track star, demanded to know
why he had not gone out for
cross-country this year. Me
Blaln’s reply that as a mathe-
matics instructor at Grinnell he
was thoroughly ineligible was
enough to send the embar-
rassed inquisitor into the
swarming crowd.

Asked if he had found Grin-
nell adequate preparation for
graduate school, McBlain said
that the ”full content” of the
courses at Grinnell made this
true, He added he was glad to
see that his own field of en-
deavur, the math department
had expanded from three in<
structors to five in his two-year
absence.

McBlain, having experienced
several “institution food serv-
ices.” had high praise for
SAGA and like everyone else
on campus these days, had a
comment to make on the ma-
turity of the average Grinnel-

‘ lian, “They seem much less

mature than when I was a sen-
ior or even a freshman myselfr
But then I guess it’s partly a
matter of a twentyrfour-year-
old looking on seventeen-year
olds rather than seventeen year
old looking on twenty—one year
olds.

Next year it’s back to S.U.I.
for “house father" McBlain.
