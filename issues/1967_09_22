Eric Thor, Cle iacto chairman
at the Tuesday meeting, pre-
faced his remarks with, “We
want to avoid a leader psychola

“Instead, we need a unit
psychology," he stressed, ex»
piaining that a strong GSM will
enable its members to exert ef—
fective pressure for changes at
Grinnell.

Thor expressed hope that stu<
dent power will not become
an end in itself, Rather,
sees the GSM as those Stu-
dents willing to be in the van-
guard of campus change.

The movement’s primary con-
cern now is the open rooms
question. Ron Steinhorn, head
of GSM's Opens Committee,
said, “We are trying to work
through ofﬁcial channels now"
to show the campus that noth-
ing will be accomplished this
way,

The GSM will put a proposal
calling for open dorms exten»

week and generally, added
Steinhorn, “keep the issue be-
me the campus,”

"The student leaders still think
we can reason with the deans.
Most of the student body won't
act until they’re sure the deans'
answer is ‘no.’

“As soon as we get an ex-
plicit refusal from the deans,
we have a rally point and can
have a revolution."

The Paper, GSM's under-
ground newspaper, edited by
Richard Schileirov, will serve
as the voice of the movement.

”We don’t intend to compete
with the 5&3," said Scllneirov.
“The 5&3 cannot provide ade-
quate space (to air GSM’s
views)," he explained.

Hopefully, said Schneirnv, the
paper will come out weekly in
mimeographed form. He in-
tends to print articles from
similar journals, news of stu-
dent revolutions a c r o s s the
country, and numerous ieatures.

“We don't have to be con-
cerned with just college is
sues," he explained. “The 5ch
has a responsibility to the cam-
pus. We don’t."

“There is a sudden burgeon-
ing of underground newspapers,"
Scllneirov continued. “They’re
not connected in any way with
what people call ‘The Estab~
iishment'.

“Most of them barely turn

limited. The content is often

EXPECTED SUNDAY .

Sue Dastal, Larry Frank, and
Russ Heuckendorf have been
selected as the first student
members of the Judicial
Council. The appointments
are expected to be confirmed
by the Senate Sunday night,

By ANNE TAYLOR

The Judicial Council of Grin-
nell's Student Government As-
sociation will be an innovation
in student selfrgovernment,

The council will consist of
three appointed students and
three faculty members chosen
by President Leggett upon the
recommendation of Mr. Wall,
the Chairman of the Faculty.

The Judical Council will have
original jurisdiction in all cases
in which violations of college
regulations are alleged to have
occurred except those in which
the house councils have origin-
al jurisdiction.

At its discretion, it may have
appellate jurisdiction over cases
handled by a House Council or
may refer any cases back to a
House Council if it is felt that
the House Council should have
original jurisdiction.

The council will have the
power to recommend any ap-
propriate measure, however, its
decision is subject to the stu-
dents right of appeal to the
President of the College.

The three student members of
the council, Sue Dostai, Larry
Frank, and Russ Heuckendori,
were selected by a committee
composed at eight honse presi<
dents and Ric MacDowell.
Eighteen candidates were inter<
viewed on Monday and Tues<
day nights, and the final selec-
tion was made Wednesday.

Frank and Heuckendurf will
serve until December, and Dos-

tal will serve until May. An.“
nouncement of the three faculty,
members of the council is also
expected Sunday. '

The faculty members of thl
Judicial Council will also in,
announced at that time and will
serve one year terms.

The most important innova.
lion within the Judicial Council
Will be its prerogative to mid.
ate investigations of student a
fairs. The council will be abid
to investigate the underlyin
causes of the violations of th
college's policies and regulaa
lions and to make resolutionl
affecting student behavior,

In previous years the function
of the council was executed byl
a High Court and n separatd
Men's and Women‘s Primary,
Courts.

The members of last year]
courts would be the first
admit that their judical aystza
lacked adequate means to m >
the needs of Grinneil‘l student
body.

The primary courts found
themselves wasting time dictat-
ing regulations and inflicting
punishments for disciplinary
problems. Most of the courts
decisions were merely cniorcmg
standing regulations, regula<
tions which, more often than
not, Could have and should have
been dealt with through housa
councils.

The courts had no integrity.
Simply, any of their decisions
could have been (and some
were) revised by the Faculty
Committee on Student Affairs
by request of the deans.

The inefficiency of the com-
plex court system was exemp ,
filed by the fact that the Higii
Court was not used once last
year.

 

IOWA EDITOR TAKES SWIPES
AT PROFS AND POLITICS

By NEIL FISCHER

Billed as a speech on possible
Republican candidates for the
next presidential election, a
Thursday night Political Dis-
cussion Group (PDG) dinner in
the private dining rooms of the
Forum lapsed into a verbal joust
between Burlington (Iowa)
Hawkeyo Editor John McCor-
mally and Professor C. Edwin
Gilmour (political science).

The bantering centered around
civil rights, the Vietnam war,
and the Republican alternative
of Ronald Reagan.

Though a “not for the record"
atmosphere pervaded most of
the evening, McCormally's quot-
able statements summarized his
overall viewn

“It's a hell of a lot more im-
portant to save America than

it is to save Vietnam . . . We
can renego on our commitment
there if there is a need at
home."

Just as a man can renego on
a Red Cross pledge il hs needq
the money more to mend a dist
aster in his home, the Iowa edi-
tor expiained, we can renege in
South East Asia if we’re in
trouble."

“Is that it reasonable politi-
cal alternative?" asked Gil-
mour.

“It is politically feasible it

TOWNIES ON CAMPUS

The rock and roll dance Saturday night in the North Lounge
was attended by college and high school students, and the com-
bination didn't seem to work. The blame did not lie with the
townics.

The high school students, attracted by the Pete Klint Quintet
(which was popular on the Iowa band circuit this summer), and

with nothing else to do that evening, arrived at the Forum
promptly at 9:30 pm. Most oi the college stttdents who were
going to the dance were still watching the hRH movie.

Even before the dance floor became crowded, high school stu~
dents were being told to leave, and those outside were told not to
come in. Forum guards patrolled entrances to the North Lounge.

The townies that remained inside were subjected to rudeness
and physical abuse at the hands of some ol the less liberal arid/0r
sober college students. Most, however, retired to the terrace out-
side the North Lounge. Here was witnessed Line of the more in-
credible sights oi the evening, as a prominent administration
ilgure announced to the townies (who were sitting harmlessly
and listening to the band) that: “all high school students must go
home." Most ot them were gone by ll pm.

Let those people who say that the high school students pay no
activity tees and theretore should not be admitted he reminded
that our omnipresent triends irom William Penn pay no more.

Let us also remember that college Students didn't start to
crowd the dance floor until alter IO p.m., and that the high school
students could have been allowed in until then and then told p0-
litely to leave.

Poor relations between the town and the college are perpetue
ated by such actions as transpired Saturday night. It is uniortunato
that the first action in 8 long time that finds students and admin-
lstration on the same side finds them both in the wrong.

REALITY iS BAD I‘OR P.R.

“The October Convocation is a iundraising vehicle tor the
college, and other benetits train it are secondary." This was told
to the sol; by James Avisorl, Director or Development

We see nothing wrong with raising money tor the college. We
see nothing wrong with doing it on campus, during the school
year. We see nothing wrong with inconveniencing the students a
little.

What is objectionable is turning Homecoming and Parents‘
Weekend into a three ring circus, and inrcing plans on the college
community, students and iaculty alike.

. . . According to the latest inlormation, Martin Luther King.
who is receiving star billing on lhe weekend, will arrive at mid-
night Saturday, preach the Sunday sermon, and leave immediately
afterward.

. . . Homecoming iloot building was eliminated this year be-
cause the noise would disturh all oi the participants, who were to
live on campus. Three at them are staying on campus.

. According to the weekend schedule, separate dining for
men and women students (men and their guests at Cowles, and
women and their guests and alumni at Quad) is the order of the
day.

Is this an attempt to balance dining iacility use (which usually
balances anyway) or is it also an attempt to retain. it just for
the weekend, the “old way or life” at Grinnell, so people can re-
member it “as it Was” rather than how it is?

There are other examples, and other problems with Convoca-
tion weekend that should be worked out. Reality may be bad ior
public relations, but it is wlizlt the students must live with the
rest of the year.

There Will be further editorials and articles on Convocation,

fused to publish last spring for
legal reasons.

everything you say; you’re just
politically naive.”

"I make a career out of be-
ing naive and writing ﬂqul it,"
McCurmally mused.

“I take up a lot of lost causes
myself, you know,” Gilmour
concluded.

“But," he added, "after in-
vesting thousands of American
lives and millions of dollars,
you tell me we’re just going to
get out?” the political scientist
asked.

“It is my personal opinion,"
McCormally answered, “that
as one Iowa newspaper editor
who has read everything he
could get his hands on . . . and
talked to everyone he could get
hold of I think we ought to get
the hell out and 12! Ho (Chi
Mihn) have it."

Turning finally to the Repub»
lican candidacy, McCormally
was asked by Gilmour who he
thought would be the Republi-
can answer to Johnson.

“Ronald Reagan,” McCor-
mally answered resolutely,
“And it scares me to death."

“When you run out or alter—
natives and answers,” the Iowa
editor added, “Reagan is the
altemative — the fictitious an-
swer, a guy who gives the im-
pression, who . . . looks good
and sounds good."

“I think people would be
much more willing to pay $100
to hear him (Reagan) speak
than Nixon," agreed Ptoiessor
William Vanderpool (speech),
county Republican chailltlan.

“I think Reagan can’t win
against Johnson,” McCormally
added, “But I think a Rocketel-
ler might be able to ur a Per.
cy -— or a RockelellereReagan
ticket."

“You all got sold down the
river tor Goldwater; we got
sold out by Johnson," he said.

“I voted for the man because
he said that Goldwater would
give us war in Vietnam,” he
explained. “and now I . ."

“Lyndon is week by week,
month by month, losing all of
his best people."

The verbal joust was “all in
the spirit oi knowledge and dis-
cussion,” PDG head otlmour
said at the outset of the meet-
ing.

“it those two guys (McCor-
mally and Gilmollr) didn’t love
each other enough to get more
rietl,” observed McCormalIy's
son, Sean (Gates sophomore),
“it could be really bitter.”

ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

By Neil Fischer

There is nothing more distasteful to me than u lot of talk
and no action - especially when all the talk is about not having
enough action.

And after a couple weeks reading columns on the “loneliness
of long distant” students, reading letters concerning loneliness
on campus, and listening to chatter — and chattering a little my-
self —— about “not enough to do at Grinnell,” I have come to a
conclusion a bit out of character {or this column.

Namely, that our college has become a place characterized
by myriad verbal "tordo’s" about everything bttt also by people
who don’t want to do anything, and that it’s not the administra-
tion‘s fault,

Or to he more tacky — Grinnell students are ingenuuus, but
have no ingenuity.

They are staunch supporters of the freedom to have an active
social liie, but they seldom 7 it ever — come up with anything
interesting or unusual to do on campus.

Take “no hours for women students.” Since my last Epistle
on the subject, individuals have come up to me ﬁrmly stating
that the only reason the “no hours” system was advocated last
year was “the principle or the thing.“

I disagree, or course, but it “the principle of the thing” was
the only reason, what the situation boils down to is this: “We
weren't interested in doing anything with the time; we were only
interested in the freedom to do nothing.”

This, while noble, seems a waste of time 101‘ everybody -t
students, administrators, SGA members, and columnists alike.

Or take the monthly social calendars distributed in the mail-
boxes.

Most students take them anyway and on Friday and Saturday
nights — and every other night ior that matter — ioilow them
like they were Army strategy maps,

A inend of mine pointed out a notable phenomenon to me the
other night — a student reading his calendar and jotting down on a
pad: “8 RM. — GO TO STUART DEMPSTER CONCERT IN
ROBERTS . r I 10:15 RM. COFFEEHUUSE FLAMENCO GUITAR
IN COFFEEHOUSE . . . 10:45 RM. ~ GO TO JAM SESSION,
NORTH LOUNGE, FORUM . I ,” etc.

But when nothing is marked on the Almighty Calendar, nobody
is in the coffeehouse or Roberts or anywhere else.

Can’t you people just go tor a cup of espresso or tell im-
promptu jokes on the Roberts stage or have a midnight picnic
in the local cemetery?

Do you always have to go to the scheduled movie?

Someone with just a modicum or ingenuity organized a Satuh
day night “Camp Out.” Good Stuiil More of that.

God damn it, can’t you do something? Anything? Try running
down the Herrick Chapel aisles during the Sunday service scream-
ing, “1 am saved! i am saved!”

or course, there ls always danger involved in advocating
new, wheel, and therefore lnteresting activities. Last year Protes-
sDr George Young (Russian) elucidated the need [or “more crazy
people" at Grinnell. Among other things, he suggested “bull-
hghts on the central quad.“

Little did the good proiessor know that, tor the above comment,
he can be indicted under Section 726.7 of the criminal statutes of
the Code of Iowa:

“it any person keep or use, or in any way be connected
with, or be interested in the management of or receive money
lor the admission at any person to, any place kept or used for
the purpose or lighting or baiting any bull, bear, cock, dog, or
other creature, or engage in, aid, abet, encourage, or assist
in any btdl, bear, cock, or dog tight, or a tight between any
other creatures, he shall he gudty of a misdemeanor."

A misdemeanor in Iowa is punishable by as much as a year in
jail, a $500 line, or both.

The risk, i think, Is worth it. But students, I guess. have lost
the knack to tell each other where to go,

I note the loss with extreme grief.

Good griei, though, maybe this week you all will do some«
thing about something. And, anyway, you can’t say it’s the ad-
ministration’s fault when you won’t.

The classes are great here, the teachers are line;
It’s the mealtimes at Saga that can blow out one’s mind.

The Iood‘s bad enough here, the sit~downs are murder,
Perchance I’d do better to pick rail-side vol-duke.

In classes. my stomach seems to talk more than I.
That load is not ottered I don‘t mean to imply:

Our kilchens, lhe Forum, and rest’ranis are great,
But with equally thin budget, my appetite shall not sate.

Why not, instead or the room and board ice,
Be given a chargeaccount about this city?

The SAGA snack bar Shall remain for most meals:
More proiit, less waste; choice shows how one feels.

MAN IS A CREATIilE Ailiiilihi.

By PAUL JONES

 

Following is the body of a
letter i received from Henry
Wilhelm. it is a reply to my
first column and very likely
expresses better the ideas
which I would have expres-
sed eventually as a follow-
up to that column. 1 would
preface the letter by asking
one question which 1 hope
you will keep in mind as you
read the letter: Does the con-
cept of creativity have any
meaning at Grinnell College?

Paul:

I read with some interest
your recent article “The Lone-
liness of the Long Distant stu-
dent" (which might be re-writ-
ten: “The Fear To Create in
the Overcritical College") in
the 5&3. You raised some in
teresting'questions, any one of
which is important, and I think
you ought to go into the subject
more in some future articles.

Your thoughts inspired me to
offer a few ideas of my own
on the subject: 1 would very
much agree with you in saying
(believing) that most students
and faculty at Grinnell have
worthwhile thoughts to express
'(or plays to direct, pots to
make, pictures to paint, poems
to write and photographs to
make) but that unfortunately
most people never let such im<
pulses come to the public
surface.

I would give the student a
bit more credit than you do, I
think, and put more or the
blame on the atmosphere cre-
ated as a byproduct of the
Grinnell idea of “critical" edu
cation. The fact that you get
as much material as you do for
NOUS is u sure indication that
there is a real creative interest
on the part of students at Grin-
nell.

in your article you said you
thought there was a fear at
"being criticized" at Grinnell,
and you went on to differen-
tiate between “the legitimate
iear of being walked on" and
the fear of being “measured
or judged." 1 would suggest
that, at least in the learning
and beginning stages, both the
fears you mentioned are equa‘l-
ly valid and legitimate in the
mind of the creative person.

When a person is learning to
feel free in expressing himself
I think the emphasis should very
much be on the quantity and
sincerity oi his efforts, and
very deﬁnitely not on someone
eise’s judgment ot "quality."
That is, in the early stages any
way, output ls much more im<
pnrtant than content.

It is in this area that I feel
Grinnell falls very short of the
Ideal. And I couldn't limit this

just to the classroom; things
like the review oi NOUS which
appeared in the Reporler last
semester, the general conversa-
tion most people engage in upon
seeing a student play, the criti<
cal attitude most people have
when looking at a student art
show, etc., all make the error
in not recognizing that the im-
portant fact is that someone
did or made something. Doing
is the important thing and 1
think this should receive most
of the emphasis.

0t course other recognition
is helpful in keeping the cre-
atlve impulse producing —— be
ing published is a very nice
incentive. And] would give
NOUS a great deal oi credit in
this area—it is probably the big-
gest single boost to individual
creators at Grinnell. 0 t h e 1'
things like Drama Workshops,
rock and roll bands, publica.
tions, bicycle coups, student
art and photography shows, en-
couraging comments from other
students and faculty, etc, are
all very important.

But the unfortunate thing is
that at Grinnell there is almost
no academic reward or encour—
agement for “creativity." I
would suggest that the art de
partment is the only area in
which there is real cooperation
between the academic and cre—
ative impulse. Some parts of
Theatre might also qualify
(however, I make a real dis—
tinction between the creative
and performing arts — I think
the writer is the real creative
one, the director might be tie
pending upon what he does to
the written script, and the actor
comes in a far third. This isn’t
to tie-value the Worth or skill
of the actor, i simply feel that
the actor is doing very much
the same thing that an orches-
tra performer does in playing
someone else's work. These
things are, I feel, usually more
of a technical skill than a
“creative" activity).

I think Grinnell has a real
confusion about culture, we
ativity, and performing. The
Music Department, in my mind,
is the most striking example
of this confusion — virtually
everyone is engaged in study-
ing, performing, and criticiz-
ing what others have done, And
the Music Department carries
the insult a bit lurther by gen-
erally restricting themselves to
the truly ancient. Jazz is hardly
felt and rock and roll is thought
vulgar. By now it should be
lairly easy to see that the good
“new" music in going to grow
out of folk and rock and elec—
tronic music. Grinnell is not
working in any or these fields.

NEXT TO THE THEATER

Students are, but the college
is not. And the Lenox Quartet
is not either. or course, 1 sup
pose this is only a symptom of
Grinnell’s classical background
~— they used to study only re-
ligion, Latin, philosophy, math
and some literature.

As you said. most “creative"
people at Grinnell feel a sad
kind of aloneness. But don’t
blame the student. Blame the
theory of education, the kind
of faculty who are attracted to
the place and the unfortunate
association of the concept of
intelligence and the ability to ef<
ieclively criticize.

i think your image of Grin-
nell as a “quiet and sterile
place” is unfortunately correct.
One sees little of that fresh
joy of people freely creating.
And that perhaps takes us back
to a central point: the motiva-
tion behind creation should be
the enjoyment of the activity
and nut other’s comments on
the effort. Some would say the
ability to create is the only
thing that makes us human. If
that is true, then most of us
don't make the classification.

The other day I read about
a meeting of psychologists in
Washington in the newspaper:
one made the observation that
making sexual love was about
the only truly creative activity
that the average persons en-
gages in. If that is true, think
what would happen if examples
of “great lovemaking" (films,
on stage, etc.) were put on the
same pedestal that great works
or literature are put on. Most
of us junior critics would then
have to stop making love —
after all, we can't do it as well
as same.

There is that feeling in our
society that if you can't “cre-
ate" as well as the best can,
you shouldn't create at all. or
if you do anyway, you should
at least feel a little guilty about
your efforts. I offer you the
thought that every art award,
high price paid. good review,
classification by college profes
sors as a ”great work", have
all contributed to this state of
affairs. These things have also
probably contributed to the
“periods" in art — which I
think are only a reflection that
people aren't left free to create
what they would it they were
truly free.

A STUDENT OPINION

Ron Steinhorn is the chairman of the Grinnell Siutlen!
Movenlent‘s committee on open dorms.

By RON STEINHORN

ill spite of the nonrmaterialization at two weeks of “frequent
and fruitful discussions” proposed in the COfHPrAWS Board
statement at last Wednesday's open Senate meeting, the issue of
reform on social regulations has been widely discussed. Reading
Paul Jones' article in last week‘s 5&3 indicates that. far from be-
ing cognizant ol' the justification and objectives of scolal reform,
Jones has failed to grasp the basic premise behind any such re-
form movement. Hls contention that student activities are con-
cerned with lhe rules themselves rather than a lasting philosophi-
cal basis on which to build shows only a very limited and
traditional view of the rulemaking process.

By necessity, the ability to create a philosophy at rule making
and subsequently the rules themselves implies the right to do so.
Traditionally on the Grinnell campus, changes in social regula.
tions initiated by students must be approved by a faculty commit.
tee, the President of the college, and finally by the trustees. Thus,
the power to control student social life resides outside the student
body and increases in inverse proportion to its contact with the
students. I think that. no one will question that this accurately den
scribes the locus of the rulemaking power at the present time.

That this is a proper State of affairs Jones does not comment
upon. Instead, he criticizes student activists for being concerned
with specific issues rather than an overall philosophy and taken
us to task for “the narrowness of the aim." If it were true that
change in specific rules is the only objective of students, their the
objective would truly be very narrow.

The primary goal, however, is not initially that of rules
change but clarification of where the governing power on social
regulations should righlhilly reside, The present power finds its
source in tradition and its philosophy of action in a situation
ethics of expediency resulting in our present state of living in
hypocrisy.

in reference to the administration's philosophy behind social
regulation and rules enforcement, it is apparent that, in complete
contrast to Jones' naive wish “to call for a statement of actual
policy or principles on the part of the administration . . the ad-
ministration feels no need to put forth a statement of an overall
philosophy on social regulation nor does it presently show an in-
clination to do so.

The case last spring in which two students went to see Fresh
dent Leggett and presented a list of questions attempting to dis-
cover administration policy behind both academic and social is
sues immediately comes to mind, The questions were printed in
The Reporter but no reply was ever received, That the only ra.
tionale behind the administration's actions seems to be expediency
is born out by tile sporalic and inconsistent enforcement of exist.
ing regulations. While it may be hoped that the community court
will eliminate at. least some of the injustices of the present situa<
tion, it should be noted that the fundamental question, What Can—
stitutes a Valid power to create social regulations, has been com-
pletely ignored.

The basis of the administration‘s present power, tradition, can
hardly be taken seriously as is determining factor in the govern-
ing of our personal lives either in the present or the iuture. Other
reasons, that the administrators are “Older and wiser” for ex<
ample, are so subjective as to be worthless. in addition, any
claim that the administration has the right to regulate social cnna
duct simply because it now occupies a position of power on this
campus is neatly shot down by Rousseau in chapter three of book
one or The Social Contract. He concludes the following way:

“We must grant, therefore, that force does not constitute
right, and that obedience is only due to legitimate powers."

Who, then, constitutes the legitimate power in the area o!
social regulation? it is obviously not the administration. According
once more to Rousseau, legitimate power resides in the common
political will of the community which he calls the sovereign power.
In other words, the right of social regulation must be present in
the group over which the rules apply. The students, who are the
only persons who are members of the community over which the
social regulations apply, are thus the only ones able to legitimately,
exercise such a sovereign power over themselves.

Thus, I es’ entire article ignores the primaly premise at
student act. 'sts, that admi stratiun control of student social
regulations constitutes an unjustified assumption of power which
rightly can only be exercised by the students. Therefore, preoccu-
pation with a philosophy behind specific rules or the question of
creating good for all equally or for the greatest number in no!
appropriate at this time.

Certainly these must eventually become areas of concern, bill
whatever is decided on in the realm of either philosophy oi social
regulation or specific rules it will be the students alone who on
empowered to decide. To foil to do so will be to deny the esseiu
tlally human right of sell-creation by determining our own caps:
bililies and responsibilities,

A HUMBLE CONFESSION: ..
How IVY his 0N lV'S

By DON WINNEY

When I was a young and somewhat virginal freshman, its
mother solemnly warned me never to mix women and beds unless‘
I was shopping — tor iurniture, that is. (My rather, thank God,
was understandingly silent.) And remembering my Calvinist heri.
tags and the warmth of the womb, l religiously ioliowed that
creed — at least my freshman year — and so have never been
plagued with that phenomenon of modern college sociology .-
lllegal visitation.

To my mural consternation, however, I once witnessed that
obscenity and discovered what the “real world” can be like at a
small liberal arts college west of the Monongahela. ,

One day l innocently walked into a friend‘s room in borrow
Augustine’s Confessions. There, on his bed, was a form almost une
known to a men’s hall — a higher-educated virgin, And there, just
ten feet away at a Sllnlit window, was a form much admired in a
men’s hall — a higher-educated animal. They were somewhat
awkwardly holding hands. -

Well, at course i was shocked — morally, intellectually, and
physically. (After all, she was quite pretty.) Why, soon they’ll be
copulating, I thought. Next they’ll be smoking pot. Today, an iv,
tomorrow VD. The implications were just too horrible to contem-
plate. 1 closed the door, shuddering. Now, there was only one man
In see.

When I reached the stairs, I saw him coming up. He looked
like u short-haired Samson, supporting two pillars oi grocery sacks,
“Dean,” I cried ecstatically, ﬂinging my arms outward. l-le tipped
his head upward and tumbled backward down the stairs along with
cascading beer cans. “My God,” i yelled, running down to him,
“Dean, l’m so sorry.”

“Forget it,” he said. “I was just shocked, that’s all,” He
braced himself on a squashed six-pack. “Somebody loves me,“ he
whimpered.

I started to divulge the oiiense, but he pushed me aside
"Alumni party," he said, grabbing some cans, “Gotta go. Gotta
89 "

I must coniess at this point I didn’t know Whether he meant
to the party or to use our modern plumbing tacilities down the
hall. But whichever the Case I let the good Dean go. Alter all, he's
a very nice gentleman Why, when he was a student he said what
the college needs is more humor, more satire, he said. The Dean’s
a Very understanding man.

But alas, no help. So I decided to try Dean Alice and hurried
to her office. Now I don’t know Dean Alice too well. She has
such a lovely smile, like the girl in all those denture commercials.
But the good Dean was too busy writing thank you notes to all the
housemcthers. Maybe next time, she smiled warmly.

Now what was I to do? I had to inform some niiieial about an
immorality or such enormity. But it had to be in conﬁdence I
simply couldn't let my friend know the iniormer. He might not
understand the moral principle involved. Should I try then that
handsome, young. dashing administrative assistant with the tine
name and high-minded purpose? Uniortunately, he was running an
errand. But the esteemed President was in, or rather, he was in
between alumni parties.

“Sir,” I pleaded, telling him the awful truth. “Do something.
DD something now.”

“Well,” intoned the President, “I just don't knuw ii I should
at. this point in time.” He scratched his head profoundly “AL
though, of course, that doesn’t mean I won't take action at the ap-
propriate time in the future. Unless, of course, I deem such action
expediently unwise. Therefore, generally speaking, the important
thing to remember, I think, is ID be earnest. But, We should always
ask ourselves, in the final analysis, is that enough?"

Talking to the President protoundly cpniused me. More than
that, i was just plain exhausted trom running around the otiices.
But, not having another way or going on, i decided there was only
one thing to do: Leg it out.

I ran back to the hall bewildered but determined to act. it
no one else was willing to light crime then regrettably I must do
my duty. I had sworn to uphold the Student Handbook. I now must
make a student arrest. The only other moral alternative was to be
an accessory to the crime, exile myself oil-campus, and live like
a monk reading Augustine. 0h, fornication against thee, 0 Presi-
dent.

l halted beiore the door, marshaling my nervous system. I
poised my iist, Then, slowly but deliberately, I scratched my
head, Well, maybe it isn’t such a great crime alter all, i thought.
Nobody cares about it Except the alumni. Maybe the rllles are lor
them. But their visitatioits are imbibing, not illegal. And besides,
why make rules when you’re more loco than parentls? But sudden.
ly my Victorian principles vanquished that seditious thought,
Think of the sex, i cried, think how awful! I iluiig open lhe door

Waters; traditional, Lil Hardin Armstrong; Chicago style, Art
Hades; and modem. Bunky Green.

Lil Hardin Armstrong comes from New Orleans and gained
fame in the ’ZO’S as part oi King Oliver’s group and tile Wife of
Louis Armstrong. Muddy Waters is the rather oi Chicago blues,
In the late 50’s, Bunky Green popularized the bebop style as an
excellent improviser on the alto Sax.

Following the concert there will be a notice hour in the South
Lounge giving everyone the opportunity to meet, question, and
talk to these artists.

Jazz is to be one at the dominant entertainment themes of
the year, according to Miss Georgia Dentel, administrative head at
student activities. in conjunction with this, George Fletcher, 21
Grinnell alumnus, has provided the jazz men photographs on dis
play in the Forum ioyen

The success of Ex Loco Parentis, Grinnell's offecampus coffee»
house caused a slight problem this weekend. Alter 12:30 Saturday
night, more people came than leit and the local police received a
complaint about the noise.

The cutieehouse will still be open from 10 p.mr to 2 arm. Fri-
day, Saturday, and Tuesday, but no policy, as yet, has been
worked out with the authorities concerning early morning noise
levels,

On the financial side, a lot of donations were received, but Ex
Loco is still in the hole for the weekend. However, some of the
iood is still salable and hopes are high ior more business in the
future.

PEANUTS GGSPEL PREACHED

By ADRIENNE LEMMONS

Mr. Robert Short, author at
The Gospel According to Pea-
nuts, gave a slide lecture and
a sermon during his visit to

Grinnell last weekend. On leave
from the University at Chicago,
where he is working on his
doctorate in Theology and Lita
erature, Short travels through-
out the country giving his slide
presentation on Peanuts.

The department oi Theology
and Literature, one of several
new interdisciplinary approach
as to theological training at the
University oi Chicago, aims at
t e a c hi n g “literary criticism
irom a theological point or
view." Short’s preparation ior
work in this field consists of
a BlD. in theology trom South-
ern Methodist University in

Dallas and a MA. in English
from nearby North Texas State.

A class at S.M.U. where thu
teacher atten illustrated them
logical points with examples
trom Peanuts gave Short the
idea ior his best-seller, which
he began shortly before starts
lng work on his PhD. The booli
was not, as is often supposed,
originally a thesis or a clasl
assignment.

For his doctoral dissertation,
he intends to write about Franz
Katha, showing that the Geo.
man novelist is "more of all
orthodox Christian thinker than
most people think."

Charles Schulz, creator of tho
Peanuts strip, is reportedly,
pleased that Short has written
this commentary which he, the
cartoonist, could not convene
iently make.

MUSICAL TUBING: HOSE T0 TROMBONE

By ANN KIRSCHNER

Last Thursday morning, Stuart
Dempster made “bathroom"
noises into his trombone, hit it
repeatedly With a stick, dragged
it across the stage and generally
deprecated it in favor of a com<
nion gar-den hose. Stuart Demp-
ster loves his trombone,

The occasion was the ﬁrst fine
arts lecture or the year, and
the man committing these seem-
ing atroCities is one of the great
trombone virtuosi in the world
His lecture was a preview of
his Concert in Roberts Theatre
on Friday.

Several years ago. Mr. Demp-
ster decided to take apart his
instrument and rediscover it—
how it is made and all the
sounds it is capable of produc-
ing. or. rather, what sounds one
may produce with the aid or a
trombone. Mr, Dempster does
not really classify the trombone
as an instrument, because “it
just sits more." Most oi the
instrument belonging to a tmm<
honist (or any brass player) is
the musician's body. Unlike a
violinist, who needs his instru-
ment to produce the sounds re
sulting irom the Vibration of the
strings, the trombonisl's tool is
his embouchure. the way he
iornis his lips to produce vari-
ous tones. This, and breath con»
trol, IS all that is really needed.
A trombonist would be foolish to
pay more than $400 for his in-
strument, Mr, Dempster os-
serted while waving his own pre-
cariously in the air. He demon-
strated a lipbuzzed selection
irom Aida, followed by an ex-
crpt from Bach's Second Brand-
enburg Concerto, He did con-
cede that the (one was some-
what improved by channeling
the sound through a cylinder,
and obliged the audience with
the same selections on the 1/,"
and 3A" garden hoses, respec-
tively.

Undoubtedly, the idea of ex-
ploring his instrument Came to
Mr. Dempster during one or
the trombone’s interminable
orchestral rests. The classical
composers did not favor the
trombone, although it is the
oldest instrument in the orches-
tra, having survived in roughly
its present form for 500 years.
At the end oi the eighteenth
century. Beethoven cliaritably

gave it eight notes (count them)
in his Fiilh Symphony, The
trombone was not heard from
again for about twenty years.
It crept into some Mahler com-
positions, such as “Das Lied
von Der Erde.” but its contribu-
tion is practically negligible
The trombone does have signiib
Cant roles in the works of such
composers as Tschaikovsky and
Liszt but according to Mr. Demp<
Ster, “the busier the trombone,
the worse the piece.”

The trombone started its du<
bious career in the sixteenth

century, doubling the voice in

church music. In the following
century, it graduated to a place
in street bands. As noted bo<
tore, it was lelt pretty much
alone alter that. Mr. Dempster
claims that the trombone is
“too simple for western music.
People don’t know what to do
with it."

Mr. Dempster has undertaken
virtually a oneman crusade in
commissioning music tor the
trombone. The works employ
the appurtenances oi the “new
music": electronic synthesis and
distortion oi trombone sounds.
His concert included a solo sona-
ta, pieces for trombone and
tape, and a theatre piece.

Sonata for Solo Trombone
(1961). by Barney Childs, utiliz-
es jazzrderived material, quart»
errlones and improvization. The
quarterrtones can be realized be
cause at tho trombone’s slide.
There are seven basic slide posi-
tions, and by means or em-
bouchure the trombonist derives
the overtone series from each
position. However, there are in<
finite positions along the slide,
and the trombonist can tlieorelh
cally produce any tone outside
the western dialonic and chro-
matic scales.

Ricercar A 5 for Trombone
(1966), by Robert Erickson,
calls for live trombones. Mr.
Deinpster had previously re
corded four parts and accom-
panied himself with the fifth.
Sequenza v (1966) by Luciano
Berio, is based on the sounds
that compose the word why. it
seemed as if the trombone was
distinctly trying to communi-
Cate With the audience.

Theatre Piece {or Trombone
Player and Tape (1966), by
Pauline Oliveros, utilized visual

and motile phenomena as well
as aural, The props included
three sprinkler systems which
were caused to rotate like pin-
wlieels as Mr. Dempstei- played
the attached garden hoses, and
candles set inside trombone
bells were made to flicker in
the same way. Mr. Dempster
moved around the stage in pan.
tomine to the accompaniment
of an electronic tape, occasion-
ally emitting sounds that could,
with some degree of accuracy.
be described as human.

Animus I for Trombone and
Tape (1966), by Jacob muck-
man, is described by the com.
poser as concerning itseli with
the relation oi man and the
machine which he created in
his own imagei It called on
the periormer to turn his head
away mm the trombone and
make his own sounds, it might
be said that Mr. Dempster
really blew his own horn Friday
night.

LONG LECTURES

Development and present my

ject or a lecture presented Tues-
day to a small group or faculty
and students by Dr. J. P. Long.
a member of the State Uni-
versity of iowa Medical SchooL
Department oi Pharmacology.

“Pharmacology, the science
of drugs, is a relative new-
comer to the medical sciences,"
according to or, Long, and he:
only recently won its iull recog~
nition, due mainly to the
achievements of John J. Abel
of Johns Hopkins University.

Little is known or the speciiio
actions of drugs. The only sno-
cesslul way or testing them is
randomly experimenting on ani-
mals. By this method such
medicines as aspirin, penicil-
lin and tuberculin drugs have
been discovered, The greatest

posing the animal to the disease

normal life span 0: a drug last.
ing only live to ten years, it
is not surprising, says Dr. Long,
that small drug companies are
disappearing, and schools are
no longer producing new niedit
cities. However, industry is car-
rying on research, and many
surprising developments have
come of it.

Dr. Lung also discussed the
pharmaceutical house, and its
method or discovering, produc-
ing, marketing and testing a
new drug. He made it clear
that great care was taken to
insure that nu adverse effects
at the drug would harm the
individual.

Towards the end of the lace
ture a question was raised as
to the great diiierences in price
between generic drugs and
brand name drugs. Dr. Long
indicated that the Cost of con<
stant research [or new drugs
demanded the high cost at
brand name drugs, and, though
it was possible that the drug
companies enuld turn over their
research to the government
and manutacture drugs at a
lower cast, he didn’t believe
that government research would
be as rewarding as industrial.

GRAY MATTER

By BILL GRAY

Monday night brought about a recurrence of the North Campus
Cretin Bowl. Led by the usual campus all-stars, it began as an
exciting yelling match instituted by one of the men’s residence
halls. After a series of scathingly original diatribes whose pur-
pose it was to institute a water fight, a momentary compromise
was reached as a quick offrtackie was run in the direction of South
Campus. As the drooling, slobbering idiots charged toward the
far-distant goal (to the great relief of those left on North campus
and the great dismay of those left on South Campus) some of us
were left to ponder on those arguments which imply that we are
mature enough to take care of ourselves. After this debacle, it
looks as though proctors should be brought back into each room
of North Campus.

Returning to the more legitimate side of North Campus sports,
I. M. football is now in full swing. The games are decidedly
rougher this year with the advent of rag—tag. Most teams seem to
be abidillg by the philosophy, “Pull the flag as you drag them
down but if you can't, just drag them down." More long runs are
in evidence due to this innovation including a 90-yard kick-off re-
turn by Phil “The Flash” Berlenthalr There are some things which
never change, however, including Langan losing football games.
They have dropped three games already this year thus stretching
their anti—win policy through at least two and one-half years.
Coming attractions include the annual bowl games which make
the Hatiield~McCoy feud look like a church social. Included Will bu
the oldest of the games featuring Dibble in the Toilet Bowl with
a new adversary, Smith, and the newest game, the Bird Bowl,
which features Clark and Cowles.

A belated word of congratulations to the homes femmes of
South Campus who daintily walked over the girls from Grace-
lend, 6-2, in ﬁeld hockey Eye-witness accounts say it was the
most brutal event on the Grinneli campus since 1000 students tried
to buy their first semester books at the same time.

iihhiiiERS WEN FERST MEET

in their first meet of the
y e a r, Grinnell's crossecount
team beat Coe, 26-33. Fog, wet
ground, and a defective start-
ing gun hampered the runners
and resulted in disappointing
times being posted.

The starting gun never did
fire as the barriers were false-
ly started several times. The
race finally commenced when
someone produced a whistle to
start them with.

Both the winner and runner-
up were from Cue. Gordon Zu-
brod won with a time of 15:58.6
on the 3 mile course followed
by teammate Earl Williams
with a l7:|JZ clocking. Third
place went to Grinnell's Doug

GRIDDERS MEET FIRST FOE

By JACK GOCHENOUER

Tomorrow is the first game
of the season for the Pioneer
griddersr In a poll of the con-
ference coaches, St, Olaf was
picked to win the conference
championship. This is roman
row's opponent. Guided by two
year veteran signal caller, Paul
Anderson, St. Olaf should be
the toughest test of Coach Edd
Bowers’ squad this year.

Success d a p e n d 5 almost
entirely on the play of veterans.
At present there are only two
non-iettermen on the starting
teamr These are Steve Carroll
and Al Cloud.

Bowers’ Boys were plagued
by an ineffective aerial attack
and a leaky pass defense last
year that resulted in a 2rd sea-
son. ln regard to this Bowers
stated, "we have been concen-
trating on those two phases of
the game and seem to be mak-
ing progress. in Lamb, Krait-
sik and Weeks, we have three
big, strong running backs if
we can pass well enough to
give them some running room,
we will give opponents’ defenses
a lot of trouble."

if this hope becomes a real-
ity Grinnell could improve its
4- record against St. Olaf and
give the students a very pleas-
ing upset victory.

A repeat of Grillnell's 13270
victory over the Des Moines
Y.M.C.A. in 1892 would be un~
likely, howeverr

FROSH HARRIERS
LOOK STRONG

By JEFF SCHECKTER '

Cross-country is at best a
lonely sport and freshmen are
generally the loneliest runners
of all. If this year's irosh
squad feels lonely it is only
because they have outrun every
one else in the race.

Led by Jack Gochenouer, the
ten members of the team pro-
vide strong competition for any
opponent. in last week's varsity
meet against cue, the freshmen
placed two men in the top
eight and came within one
point of topping the cue vatsity
if their score was counted.

The team members are Jack'
Guchenouer (f i f t h overall
against Coe), Ernie Weston
(eighth overall), Eric Jahn,
John Roweil, Tim Power, John
Russell, Bob Fritzlleier. Dim
Cavender, Wayne Luefker and
Erin Friesen.

The game will be held at
1:30 p.m. at Ward Stadium. An
added attraction will be a

cross-country race that is ex-
pected to climax in front of
Ward Stadium during the half
time of the football game.

Eric .Tahn of the Grinnell Frosli,
and tenth place went to a
C09 runner.

In an interview after the meet
Coach Obermiller said he was
particularly pleased with the
performance of his freshman
team. Speaking on the Varsity,
he said they should have a good
season and are in better shape
now than they were at this
time last year. He picked Caries
ton as the overwhelming favu
on'te to win their fifth conseo<
utive conference championship.
Obermiller chose Monmouth,K
Cornell, and Grinnell as posn
sible runner-ups and a chance
that St. Olaf might be in the
running too.

Tomorrow at 1:20, Grinnell
will host St. Olaf in a four
mile run on the Grinnell course.
The Grinnell Freshmen will 17!

THE KIBITZER

By JOHN RAZ

Precision slam bidding and Culbertson Asking aids

in general, there are at least two fundamentally different
kinds of bids: bids which give partner information and bids which
ask partner for information, Very often in slam bidding one need-
to know if partner has the first or second round controls in a par-
ticular suit or suits. These are the aces or voids, the kings or sin-
gletons, the knowledge with which one can decide to sign off at a
safe level or proceed to slam. Thus, very frequently in slam
bidding you need to make an asking bid, asking partner if ha no.
the controls.

The most common asking bid is the Blackwood Convention in
which one player bids 4NT, asking his partner for the number of
his aces. Partner then answers with a step response showing
quantitatively zero. one, two. or three aces. Unfortunately, this
most common slam convention is inadequate for the vast majority
of slams, because it does not give qualitative information (i.e., the
ace of a particular suit) and it cannot convey the distributional
Controls (i.e., the Voids or smgletons) Furthermore, it does not
exploit the full possibilities of the asking bid.

Culbertson did. Introduced in 1935, slam asking bids have be
come, along with the complicated step response conventions of
the continental systems, the most efficient way to bid slams.

Tile asking bid is an artificial forcing bid made in a question.
able Suit in order to find out if partner has control in that stilt.

Initially, the partnership must have an agreed trump suit.
Any suit that has been bid and raised by partner is an agreed
suit. or two bid and raised suits, the last suit is the agreed trump
suit. After a suit has been agreed upon, any bid in a new suit at
the level of four or higher is an asking bid, and is entirely artificial
and is absolutely forcmg one round. The member of the partner-
ship who makes the bid then becomes figuratively the dictator of
the hand since he will finally determine the contract, after which
his partner cannot bid. Thus, one person, usually the possessor of
the stronger hand, becomes the decision maker. The responses to
the first asking bid are shown in the following table:
