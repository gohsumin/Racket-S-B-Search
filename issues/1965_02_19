South Campus Doors Need locks.
Senators Proclaim In Resolution

By Jeanette Mall

The following resolution was
unanimously adopted at the
Student Senate meeting Wednes-
day night:

WHEREAS it is the right of a
student to be secure in her
person, room, and posses-
sions (page 43, Student
Handbook), and

WHEREAS students are re-
sponsible for their own per-
sonal property. . . and the
college is not responsible
for loss, theft, or damage
to such property arising
from any cause (page so,
Grinnell College Bulletin),
and

WHEREAS doors locked when
a person is absent from her
room would not destroy the
congenial student attitude
within the quadrangle but
would rather prevent an at-
mosphere of suspicion, and

WHEREAS women students are
not at present allowed to
assume the responsibility of
personal protection if they
so desire, and

WHEREAS the theft rate in
the women’s quadrangle
has increased noticeably

“Be it resolved that the Stu-
dent Senate feels it is the re—
sponsibility of Grinnell College
to provide its women students
with a means of protecting their
personal property by installing
locks on room doors in the
quadrangle,"

Another resolution concerned
with the SGA election date was
adopted. “Resolved: That AF

 

ticle 11, Sec. D, (1) (a) of the
SGA Constitution shall not pre-
vent the election of the SGA
President from being held on
March 15, 1965."

The son constitution states
that the SGA election shall be
held in the second semester no
later than three weeks before
spring break,

In other business, AWS Pres-
ident Judy Edquist reported
that the proposed change in
room drawings for women’s
dorms was overwhelmingly de-
feated in house meetings last
week, The change had been sug-
gested by Dean of Women Jean
Slocum.

Members of the election com<
mission, which is in charge fo
formulating procedures for the
SGA convention and election,
were announced, They include
Nancy Cox, chairman, Gerald
Goddard, Karen Lauterbach,
Ellen Deteril'lg, Jim Parkison,
and Phil Johnson.

Signe Hansen, manager of
the book coop, stated that the
Venture netted 3100. Half of the
money will be kept as capital
for running the COop next se-
mester.

Is Religion Going to Church? Variety
Of Answers Offered by Seminarians

relevance of contemporary re-

By Connie Simon

A panel of five senior semi-
nary students, visiting Grinnell
last weekend under the spon-
sorship of the Board of Relig-
ion Interfaith Committee, spoke
informally Sunday night in the
South Lounge comfortably
filled with students.

The panel centered their
thought around the announced
topic, “ls Religion going to
Church?" Members included
Fran Myska (Bethel Theologi-
cal Seminary, St, Paul); Wil»
liam Brown (University of
Chicago Divinity School); Miss
Bertha Eby (Chicago Theologi-
cal Seminary): Larry Bremer
(United Theological Seminary
of the Twin Cities); and Neil
Housewright (Vanderbilt Un
versity Divinity School),

Viewpoints presented ranged
from support oi the Church as
an institution to a considerably
more liberal point of view. All
members of the panel, how-
ever, expressed a belief in the
church, in some form, as be-
ing requisite lor religion,

Representing the conserva-
tive point of view was Brown
who based his support of the
church upon its connection with
Christianity, which he spoke of
as being “distinguished from
and preferable to “mere relig-
ion."

0n the other h'and House-
wright frankly questioned “the

 

ligious institutions," His en<
thusiasm for the church sprang
not from its traditionally
ascribed functions, he said, but
rather from his recognition of
the church of today as “a great
orealtlve force" and the source
of “much social action." House—
wright cited the founding of
colleges and the furthering of
the civil rights movement as

Stealing Major Problem In Quad;
Numerous Cases Heighten Concern

By Sue Taylor

Several thefts in the women‘s
dormitories last week have
brought the problem of stealing
to the forefront of campus con<
cern. The speculation within
and without the quadrangle as
to the sources of and answers
to the problem has increased.

See editorial on page 2

That ‘thievery has been a
little more prevalent this
year than last,” was confirmed
by Mrs. Marjorie G. Ravitts,
assistant in the quadrangle of-
fice, to whom all reports of
stealing are submitted,

However, Jean M. Slocum,
dean of women, said many

‘A’ * ‘k

thefts occur which the office
never learns about.

Most often it is money that
is stolen, These thefts usually
have occurred around the quad-
rangle dining room and in stu-‘
dents‘ rooms.

Mrs. Ravitts pointed out that
stealing was particularly heavy
just before Christmas vacation.
Another heavy wave of stealing
has occurred within the last
three weeks.

On Dec. 9, Miss Slocum sent
a memo to all women students
warning “that money and
purses cannot and should not
be left unattended," and urging
particular caution. She also
announced that arrangements
had been made with Saga of-
ficials for women to carry

Grinnell Frosh Withdraws From School
In Connection With Stealing Incident

A Grinnell freshman has
been found responsible for sew
eral break-ins and thefts on
south campus last week and
has withdrawn from school for
medical reasons, according to
Dean of Men 5. Eugene Thomp-
son.

Thompson and the local po-
lice brought the case to a con-
clusion last Saturday night af-
ter the student was recognized
from a description provided by
his last Victim.

The two known break-ins oc-
curred on the evenings of
Wednesday and Friday, Feb. 10
and l2. Both occurred in Read
hall, where the student gained
entrance through unlocked win-

the second story. From there he
walked up to the third floor.

Several articles of cloth'mg
were taken during the first en-
trance; these were later found
torn and discarded near Cowles
hall.

In the second breakdn, the
student was surprised by his
victim and escaped by jumping
from the third story window to
the loggia roof and then to the
ground, Nothing was taken in
the second break-in.

Student ‘on Ride’
Ends in Suspension

A West Norris junior has
been suspended for three
weeks for taking and using
John Burma’s (sociology) auto-
mobile without the professor's
permission.

The car was taken from in
front of Burma's home on
Ninth Avenue late at night on
Thursday, Feb. 11.

Dean of Men 5. Eugene
Thompson said that the stu-
dent had been drinking but was
not intoxicated.

The student was apprehended
when the car halte‘d because of
a mechanical failure and a
Grinnell police car on patrol
stopped to see if .help was
needed, There had been no re-
port of a stolen car, and the po-
lice had merely stopped to help
what they thought was a car
stuck in the snow.

The student was alone when
apprehended. No charges were
filed or pressed by Burma.

 

their purses into the quad din-
ing room, a practice which had
previously been a rule yiolw-
tion.

During the first twelve day:
of February, according to Mu,
Ravitts, about $150 was stolen
in 17 different cases. The great
majority of these 17 thefts were
money, she said.

Valuable books, jewelry, reo-
ords, perfume, and clothing
have also been taken from
rooms.

Main hall and Read hall havl
been hardest hit in the thefts.
However, no hall in the quad-
rangle has been entirely free
of stealing, The president of
one hall knew of only two
cases of stealing (both money
in the range of 310-15) in her
hall, while the president of an-
other hall reported only threo
cases, all thefts of money.

On a single night following
comprehensive exams, two
sums of money were taken
from one room in Main hall,
and a second room on a differ-
ent floor was rifled but nothing
was stolen,

One basement room had $10
and $15 stolen from it on sepe
arate nights in the same week.
In both instances, the money
was hidden in drawers under
clothes or cosmetics,

In another basement, four
rooms were robbed the same
night during interim, but the
total amount of money taken
was small,

Other thefts range from
framed pictures to purses con-
talning such things as glasses,
keys, and identification.

One purse which was taken
contained $35 cash, as well as
other valuable items such as a
pen and glasses. Recently, sev-
eral purses containing around
$20 cash have been taken from
Main lounge.

The library has also been the
scene of several thefts, rang-
ing from cash Values of $.25 to
$26.

A check was made with Pete
Read CofHP president, and S.
Eugene Thompson, Dean of
Men, both of whom said that

Locks for Women's Doors

Following last week’s quad break-ins and the revelation
that there had been 17 thefts in the first 12 days of February
in the quad, the 5&8 began searching for answers to why the
quad is so vulnerable to such incidents and what was going to
be done to relieve the problem.

We learned that in an effort to discourage entry along the
loggia roof, Buildings and Grounds is considering a temporary
proposal for lighting the loggia area more thoroughly. Ac-
cording to Evan Walden, director of the physical plant, “lights
are the first step to deter anyone fooling around over there.”

We had considerably less luck in finding out what
measures were being taken to protect the quad from internal
thievery.

We found that at one time all doors in the residence halls
had locks, but that they were removed in the 19405 with the
initiation of an “honors system.” It was later realized that
north campus was particularly vulnerable to outside break-ins
because of its open loggia, so locks were gradually installed in
the men’s halls about six years ago. Supposedly, no locks were
installed on south campus because of the protection of its
locked loggia.

The situation has remained the same until the present,
but ' cent incidents point out that the quad isn’t as safe from
stealing as had been thought. The question of locks for rooms
in the quad has again presented itself.

Vice President M ~ritt Ludwig, when interviewed this
week, knew of no specific reason for not having outside locks
on rooms in the women’s halls, but he did note that ‘the deci-
sion has never been made on the basis of cost." (Walden esti-
iinated that locks would cost from eight to ten dollars per

oor.)

Dean of Women Jean M. Slocum had no comment to make
about locks other than that she knew of no present policy for
not having locks.

When questioned about the situation on north campus,
Dean of Men S. Eugene Thompson said that there has not been
much Stealing in the men’s halls. Thompson also said that
about 250 men have checked out keys for their doors this year.

Acting President James H. Stauss said this week that he
was unaware of any great demand for locks, but he added,
“If the students, through student government agencies, wish
todmalée requests concerning locks, they will be promptly con»
51 ere ."

‘ The demand for locks has been voiced. The AWS Board
issued a statement urging the installation of outside locks on
all room doors in the quad. The Student Senate has unani-
mously passed a resolution asking the college to provide locks
on room doors in the women’s halls.

Although installing locks might be a negative and “dis-
honorable” method of approaching the problem of stealing, it
nonetheless seems to be the only method that can cure the
situation.

it was pointed out during our interviews that stealing is
a problem even in colleges where doors have locks; but with
locks on the doors, women at least would have an effective
means of protecting their property when a rash of burglaries
breaks out.

_ _ Nor sliouldrthe vague fear that locks will create an “arti-
ficial coldness.” iii the quad be used as an excuse for not pro-
viding proper protection.

The S&BAjoins the AWS Board and the Student Senate
in urging speedy installation of locks on room doors on south
:ampus.

 

Gerald Goddard
Preface lo the Coming War

For the fifth time in its history the United
States is going to war over a principle that
has no foundation in political reality, It is un<
derstandable and perhaps desirable in the Con—
text of the containment policy that the U.S.
should somewhere take a stand against the un-
ending Communist advance. But the point
where the line is drawn should coincide with
favorable geographical, political, and military
factors. South Vietnam, with its impenetrable
jungle and fragile government, fulfills none of
these basic conditions.

The U,S. should have learned from the
French experience that Vietnam is impossible
to defend. Nationalist guerrillas, striking from
the cover of the population, cannot be defeated
by conventional military strategy or superior
military force of numbers. Rather, the senti-
iments of the population that protects the guer-
rillas must be turned against them. In this,
democraticcapiialisi appeal has been remark-
ably unsuccessful.

The character of our response to the Com-
munist challenge has actually violated our own
purposes. By opposing liberal ideas With dicta-
torial, righcwing governments, like that of
Diem, we have enhanced the Communist ap-
peal. One wonders whether support of more
liberal governments might have been a more
effective strategy.

By going into Vietnam when the national
government broke down, U.S. policy further
damaged its ideological appeal by putting
us in a colonial role. At the present time
We control the foreign, military, and economic
policy of Vietnam, if not the government itself.
This has played right into the hands at the
carry—over antl-colonialist sentiment and die
Communist propaganda attack,

The nature of the Vietnam war further no
cents our hopeless position there. Finally rea~
lizing we could not defeat the Viet Cong guer-
rillas in ﬁle south. we have carried the war to
the north with repeated air Strikes. At first
glance this policy may seem reasonable since
our greatest strength is in the air power ofthe
seventh fleet rather than ground forces. How—
ever, we must realize that by expanding the
war in this way, we are inviting retaliation by
the Communists using their major strength in
land forces. This could be in the form of a mas-

sive invasion of South Vietnam by combined
North Vietnamese and Chinese troops.

We cannot discount the vital interest of
China in the security of North Vietnam. To this
point they have given only indirect assistance
to the Viet Cong, but should U.S. attacks on
the north continue, we can expect them to play
an expanding role. The United States would
not tolerate Cuban attacks on Nicaragua even
though we have used that country as a base of
attack on Cuba. Similarly. we must not think
that China will stand by While we attack one of
its bordering countries.

The crucial factor that foretells the coming
war is the nature of the U,S. commitment. Dis~
regarding the fundamental strategy of always
leaving yourself and your enemy a face-saving
way out, we have essentially closed the door
behind us by staking our prestige on victory
in Vietnam.

Thoughts of a negotiated selﬂement at this
point are illusory. Our enemy will not go to the
conference table as long as he is winning in the
field and we will not negotiate from a position
of weakness. '

The Korean example bears out this point.
Negotiations were only possible when the mili-
tary situation was stalemated, But such a solu-
tion is not possible in Vietnam, because the
conflict is not taking place in the Same element.
While we attack the North from the air, our
enemy attacks the South on the ground.

A footnote to this situation is the possibility
that recent defense pledges by Soviet Prime
Minisienifusygin could mean material and tech
nical aid in air‘deiense to North Vietnam.

This might seriously limit our effectiveness
in the air in addition to injecting immediate So-
viet interest in 5.13. Asian developments.

A further implication of the Vietnam war is
its effect On the division in the Communist bloc.
Although We will know more clearly after the
all party congress in March, there is reason in
believe that U.S. escalation of the war has gin
en the Chinese and Russians the common
ground needed to soften, at least temporarily,
their basic ideological differences.

in short, going to war (in South Vietnam)
over South Vietnam is not worth the cost, It is
a war we cannot win. If we are going to stand
up to the Communist advance, we should do it
at n time and place Where there are reasonable
chances of success.

Roberts Rules Of Disorder

One morning, when if was very dark and very
cold, i received a cryptic little note in my mallv
box from my editor. He wished, it seemed, w
talk with me.

“Paul," he said when I arrived at his cluttered,
businesslike office. “Paul.” he said again, r9<
peating himself in a manner not uncommon in high-
ranking executives. “l’ve been reading your col<
umn.” I was flattered. “But Paul,” he said care-
fully, “I'm worried about yaur column."

“Well, that makes two of us," i told him flippant-
ly. “I’ve been worrying about this week’s column.
i thought I might do this little piece on dancing

He cut me off. “Paul, you just don’t seem to
grasp the purpose of a column. Now what do you
think a column is for?"

He‘s an awful pedanr, full of a lot or silly ques-
tions like that. “Entertainment?" 1 ventured.

“No,“ he said wearily.

"Information?"

“No."

“Filler?”

“You're gelling closer."

“All rlglil, i give up. What's a column for?”

“Paul," he condescended, “It's for attack. You
must never let anything get in the way of your
main purpose, attack! Now take ciu-l's last col»

"Oh, yes. I read eVEI‘ylllmg in ilie 5&8!"-

“Now he attacked something. Did you take care-

I was hesitant. “Well , . ."

C. A. Harrell Calls for Effective City Government

By Glen Ashmon

Professor Bradley called him

But he began his lecture Mon-
day night in the South Lounge
by “cutting himself down to
size.”

ernment. He maintained that

cal units in thls country. These
expenditures, he pointed out,
ran $1 billion above income.
One of the reasons for this dai»
icit, according to Harrell, is
the fact that 45% of the tax dol-
lar is expended on projects
which return only 6% of the
tax. Included in such projects
are urban renewal and local
welfare programs.

Who finances these services?
Will this source of income con-
Linue to support an expanding

A. Harrell delivers his Sua-

local economy? is it fair to ex-
peCt this source of income to
continue to carry the weight of
th e local economy? These
were the questions which Har-
rell tried to answer and which
local government will encoun-
ter more and more.

The answer to the first ques—
tion is simple enough: it is the
property owner. Harrell does
not believe, however, that
property taxes can meet the
cost of these expanding serv-
ices nor does he believe they
ought to. He argued that local
services affect people, not
property. He feels, therefore,
that the tax burden should be
shifted from property to people,
i.e. to services extended to
people. This, he maintained,
can be done through sales
taxes and charges on servicesl
where such charges can be ap-

 

plied equally to all residents.
As examples, he referred to
charges applied to the water
system, g a r b a g e collection,
and, in some cases, recreation.

Federal and is a necessary
though reluctant means oi fi-
nancing expanding services as
Harrell pointed out. Harrell
further noted that increased
services to business areas and
downtown rejuvenation will not
only reverse the downward
trend of income from those
areas, but is necessary for a
city’s own protection.

Another problem area with
which Harrell said local gov-
ernment must contend is social.
Included are such problem
areas as urban renewal, educa<
tion. and the mass transporlar
tion problem. Harrell main-
tained that the mass transpor-
tation problem is not being met
and will grow increasingly
acute. A partial answer he feels
is subsidation of expressways,
mass transportation systems,
and parking areas by local
government.

Concluding his lecture, Har-
rell emphasized the need of lo»
cal government to get its citi-
zens interested in their governe
ment and concerned With its
welfare. According to Harrell,
the local governmental system
is the foundation of democracy.
He reiterated the long-standing
concept that if democracy is to
blossom on a national level. its
precepts must be practiced at
home, i.e. at the local level.
His final advice to all citizens
was, “Acquaint yourself with
the power structure of your
community. If it: is good, sup-
port it; if it is bad, oppose it."

On Early Yeats Manuscripts

“Yeats at Work," a critical
study of William Butler Yeats'
pre-publication manuscripts by
Curtis 8. Bradford (English)
will be published in June by
the Southern lllinois Univer<
sity Press.

Publication or the 384-page
book will commemorate the
centennial of the Irish poet’s
birth. He died in 1939.

Bradford has devoted most
of his scholarly research to the
work or Yeats for 20 years and
has been actively researching
the book since 1954. He did ter
Search work in Ireland during
the 1554-55 academic year and
again in the summer of 1960,

and at Harvard University dui‘
ing the summers of 1958 and

Bradford's research included
combing through the vast but
nearly illegible collection of
working manuscripts left by
Yeats and tracing the develop-
ment of poems, plays. and
prose from their beginnings to
finished form.

Vernon Sternberg, director of
the Southern Illinois University

is now required of all entering

basically of freshman English

science, and religion. The Be»
luit Round Table writes, “That
undelrclassmen should like the
course—though not unanimous-
ly~is perhaps the surest sign
of success. A fellow under-
classman can always be recog-
nized by the peculiar combina-
tion of books he carries: Pla-
to, Coriolanus, Walden Two, and
Sartre. It simplifies pickups at

Robert M. Shelton, imperial
Wizard of the United Klans of

called Antioch College a “mas-
sive center of Communism in
Ohio.” In an earlier statement
issued in September, the
American Legion had called

peated opportunity” had been
given “known leaders of the
Communist party, U. s. A., to
propagandize students on the
Antioch College campus."

Student Showe Says
Classes Too large

To the Editorl
After the initial shock of re-
suming classes subsided, I be—
came sadly aware of the tre-
mendous size of many of my
and other classes. I have been
substantially convinced of the
merits of Grinnell-type instruc-
tion (with an outstanding 11:1
student-faculty ratio) which
could provide an intimate stu-
dentefaculty relationship. I have
yet to see it, With a rather nor-
mal schedule 1 rind my classes
averaging a hectic 43 students
per meeting—larger than most
high school sessions! in view
of the facts that (1) this is sole-
ly an undergraduate institution
and (2) there exists an ample
and partially untapped faculty,
I feel that the situation dimin-
ishes the value of the class-
room meetings and that the
students deserve and desire a
closer exposure to our excep—
tional faculty. This opinion ap-
pears to prevail among the stu-
dent body, and we would wel-
come a faculty or administra»

tion comment.

Administration, Faculty and Students
Have No Communication, Dillon Says

To the Editor:

Cultural and intellectual life
has blossomed this year at
Grinnell. Classes, guest lec-
tures, dramatic productions,
and concerts have all been
stimulating. There is an active
group social life; adult lead<
ership still generally displays
a moderate attitude toward our
affairs. Yet there is a sour note
in the symphony. Something is
wrong.

Students are dismissed or
placed on probation with scant
explanation. When a protest is
made at the increasing strin-
gency of discipline, those in
authority reply, “Pretty soon
we start shooting people down."
The word gets out that if one
is “heat.” he had better be-
ware. Faculty, parents, and
alumni are reported to be urg-
ing more stringent control, The
reader may say that this is
merely a mood in the air, un—
defined and poorly supported.
Yet this is the key to the prob-
lem. If some among us have
specific proposals to make, can
they not identify themselves
and speak out publicly, so their
ideas may be maturely and
reasonably discussed? This
open approach might be highly
constructive and certainly less
confusing.

Admittedly, we as students
must take responsibility for
our many mistakes. I do not
believe we are committed to a
burdensome and pharisaic in-
terpretation of all social rules,

 

but I know we are obligated to
serve the end of those codes—
buiiding a happy association
where tolerant people respect
each other. ,

Where we have failed, our
freedoms have been lost. The
emergency in Langan Hall il
an example. We all must recall,
however, that student peroga-
tives have not only been A
longtime part of our way of life,
but may be found in the earliest
Western universities of the Mid-
dle Ages. The arbitrary author-
ity of administrations is n
more recent innovation. in re-
forming our government
through the coming referen~
dum, we will be continuing a
process which is no new lad.
but is in various forms the
heritage of centuries.

The solution to our misun-
derstanding lies in the very
nature of the Grinnell experi-
ment. We have grown by a
free use of reason and a toler-
ant social milieu. We will stag-
nate by the nostalgic imposi-
tion of sterile middle class mo-
rality. Expulsions, suspensions,
and probations will miss the
mark. The youthful, spirited,
and emancipated character of
Grinnell student society would
be quickly lost if its liberal
essence were removed. Open
dialogue on policy with certain
respect for our rights is essen-
tial for us to work harmonious-
ly and creatively with the ad-
ministration.

Couririghi: Village Builds ‘New Sense of Digniiy'

Ed. Note: This is the sec-
ond and final part of a report
from Paul Courtright, ’64,
who is serving as a Grinnell
Travel-Service Scholar at Ah-
mednagar College in India
this year.

In the village itself, new homes
are being constructed of sturdy
rock, relatively spacious and hav-
ing windows, replacing the hap-
hazard, windowless structures of
plastered cow dung and grass
roofs, filled with smoke from the
family cooking fire.

The labor is provided by the vil-
lage people themselves, some ma-

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

is losing out because of this trend?"

“1 don't mind so much that our
young are leaving the villages. I
know that these boys who are go-
ing to colleges and later settling
in the cities will use their educa-
thin to help us, either directly as
Government officers, or indirectly
in business or professional work
These young men who migrate to
the city in search of jobs many
times have left their wives and
children, or brothers and sisters
behind and send money home to
support them. Our family ties are
very deep; they will not forget us”

One of the women brought some
tea. Indian tea is a mixture of

terials such as sheet metal roofing
is supplied by the government. By
this kind of activity, the village
people with their new houses put
together a new sense of dignity.

I talked with the Patil of the Vilv
logo of Kolhewadiu His name is
Bapuji Shanker Shelke, a man of
about 4550, a Maratha by caste,
and farmer by profession. The
lines in his face, his long mus~
tache, beginning or grey at the
edges, his white turban casual-
ly tied on his head and having a
slight coat of red dust from the
fields, all showed him to be a man
used to hard work and concerned
about the betterment of the people
of his village. As he sat on his
haunches against the wall of an
ancient Hindu temple in honor of
Lord Shiva where we had escaped
the hot afternoon sun, he lit up a
cigarette and smiled. His teeth
showed the red stains of chewing
‘pan,’ or concoction of spices and
betel nut which leaves a mild nar-
cotic effect.

First I asked him, "DO you be
lieve the Government is trying to
improve your way of life?" He
thought for a moment, took arr
other drag on his cigarette, and
answered, "I think the Govern-
ment is there to help our villages
to increase production and raise
the living standard. Sometimes we
are disturbed when we hear of cor-
ruption and waste. Certainly some
of the rural development officers
are more interested in drawing
their salary and advancing them-
selves than in helping us to im-
prove things here. But generally I
believe the people in Delhi and the
local executives are trying to help
us. These things take time."

Then i asked, “Many young men
are leaving the villages to attend
college and later settling in the
cities. Others move to urban areas
in search of more profitable em-
ployment. Do you think the Village

 

strong tea with milk and sugar
boiled together. He poured the tea
into the saucer and balancing it on
his finger tips, blowing on the
surface of the liquid to cool it,
sucked it noisily into his mouth
and swallowed.

“What do you think about the
population 'expiosion’ in India to-
day?"

“I am not worried about popula-
tion expansions To my mind, me
most urgent problem is increasing
food production. When we can
raise our yield by better farming
methods and irrigation, then we
can feed and support many more
people, even than we have now.
All this talk about family planning
is not the answer. What we must
do is grow more food and im»
prove our land.”

in a couple of more months the
road connecting Kolhewadi with
the main road will be finished. The
villagers have worked long hours
in the hot sun, earning 30c per
day during this slack season while
they wait for the harvest of their
grains. These are hard times. The
food prices because of shortages
have risen 100% in three years. To
those people on subsistence in-
comes, the pressure is intense. By
building the road they can earn
enough money to carry on until
harvest. The students have do-
nated their labor as a gesture of
faith in the villages growth.

The story of Koihewadi is not a
dramatic one, bllt it is typical
enough of the job that has to be
done. No crash program from Delhi
can bring rural India out of its
backwardness. It Will be a slow
process, a village by village awak»
ening. it will take a great many
people willing to work at this
level, where there is no glory to be
gained.

And what does the experience at
Kolhewadi say about lndian high
er education?

One of the many institutions in-
dia inherited from the British was
their educational systems The or-
ganization of education in India to-
day is still primarily academically
and theoretically oriented. The
curriculum. textbooks, syllibi, and
examinations are prescribed by a
committee of the university to
which a particular college is af—
filiated. The individual professor
is obliged to follow these require
ments and prepare the student to
pass the midyear and final ex«
aminations which Will determine
his academic standing with the
university.

The advantage of this system is,
of course, uniformity. What is
taught and required across the
country is standardized. But this
uniformity is purchased at a high
price. There is little imagination,
creativity, and resourcefulness re
quired on the part or the professors
and less from the students. Re-
search work, individual inquiry on
unassigned topics and intellectual
curiosity is rare.

The development of the Indian
economy requires minds and

based on sound intellectual think-
ing and personal experience in
specific situations. The Rural Life
Development and Research Pro-
ject of Ahmendnagar College is at-
tempting to bring these two neces»
sities together for its students.

If a student is studying the or-
ganization and management of
rural cooperatives, he can work
with a cooperative being formed
among several villages for the
processing and marketing of pea-
nut oil. If another student is work-
ing on the dynamics of conflict be-
tween traditional and progressive
elements in village India, he can
take a nearby tribal village in the
midst of decisive economic and so—
cial change as a case study.

Page F' o

It is this activity of applying eco-
nomics and sociology into an actual
situation involving real people,
their aspirations, frustrations, suc-
cesses and failures, which makes
the Rural Life Project work stimu-
lating.

This article has been an attempt
to give a glimpse into one small

facet of an Indian experience of the
phenomenon known as “economic
development." There are no
graphs, no statistics, no grand gen-
eralizations instead there are peo-
ple whose lives are being changed,
people who are trying to adjust
from an ancient way of life to n
more prosperous, and inevitably
more uncertain one.

us.
Read, saying that they “very
rarely have problems," added
that there is not as much inter-
change between the halls on
north campus, and thus 5
stranger is noticed more quick»
1y then on south campus. He:
also said that when something
happens, the men can always
lock their doors.

with regard to the stealing‘v
problem, several of the worm-
en’s house presidents said the
women students "reluctantly
believe that. it’s going on." One
house president said that the
girls in her hall ”don't feel
touched by it." ”People are
still trusting in our hail,” said
another president.

While this attitude seems
prevalent in the quad. one
president said that “people are
being more careful,” and an.
other noted a ”more realistic
attitude.”

Miss Slocum said that “any
stealing is a major problem,
but agreed that there is an in-
creased awareness of the prob-
lem now. She emphasized that
“one of the greatest problems
in dealing with reported theft
is that people don’t report it
soon enough." Women should
report to their house presi-
dent, head resident, and to the
quadrangle office as soon as a
theft is discovered.

 

Miss Slocum said that the
problem is once again being
studied, and added that she will
welcome suggestions.

been a concern for the board
at seven at its regular meetings

All?

By Paul Trigg

How [he Grinnell College basketball team could lose to St.
Olaf by 17 points and Carleton by 1|) points at Northfleld is a
real poser indeedr Losses to C02 5053 and Beloit 107-77 only
augment the dilemma; and it is everyone' 5 hope of course,
that we will not be shown the answer when these two teams in-
vade Darby arena this weekend.

The mystery of the Grinnell basketball team began with the
Cornell game, which seemed to prove all pre-beason pessimists
wrong. However, any optimistic hopes were dispelled just as
quickly with the two disastrous road trips to Northfield and
Cedar Rapids-Beloit,

Thus, last Friday night many students trooped over [0 Dar-
by hoping they would not want to exit at half-time and head
for Lolita. (Word has it that one person did leave at the half,
but rather than going to the movie he went to the library.)
Instead of being blitzed, however, the Pioneers extended the
Oles to the fullest.

Again Saturday, thinking Friday night to be an act of God,
students marched back to the gym only to see their heroes rout
Carleton 81-65 despite the efforts of a 6" 7" sophomore center
from (of all places!) Crosby—ironton, Minn. The obvious ques<
Lion asked by all was how did this apparent metamorphosis oc-
cur? The following is an amateur’s attempt at evaluating the
team and what happened last weekend.

In the past four years we have seen quite a variety of has
ketball player-types here. There has been a guard who could
shoot the eyes out of the basket, but played defense like one of
his feet was nailed to the floor; a forward Who could also shoot
well, but tended to dribble the ball off his metatarsals rather
frequently; a center who could rebound and dunk, but was not
quite rangy enough to stuii his foul shots; and a host of others.
These gentlemen were obviously played for their strengths and
in spite of their weaknesses. BeCause of this, it was easy to be-
come quite exasperated watching their weaknesses exploited
by opposing teams.

This year’s team is somewhat different than these past
teams, however. There is hardly an outstanding shooter, passer
or rebounder on the entire team, but they are a group of good
all-around basketball players who don't happen to have a man
over 6' 3” amongst them, Thus, they are forced to work hard
for every basket because they lack che physical strength and tal-
ent of most other teams. Last weekend this is precisely what
they did, harassing. driving, and generally out-hustling their
opponents.

The encouraging aspect of this turn of events is that the
average Grinnell tan seems to appreciate the effort that is being
put forth by the team. One of the loudest cheers or the weekend
occurred after Bob Watt's symbolic theft of the ball from the
hands of St. Olaf's very fine guard Eric Grimsrud.

At home this team is young, exuberant, and aggressive. One
possible explanation for the away games might be that the youth
turns to immaturity, the exuberance to disillusionment, and the
aggressiveness to docility. Without these ingredients in abun—
dance, the team Cannot do battle with the recruit-Infested squads
in the rest of the conference (For the record, these last prepo-
sitional phrases are in jest).

Roundballers Split Week End Bill;
Fall to Si. Olaf. Defeat Carleton

By Steve Casey

The Grinnell basketball team
split a pair of conference
games last weekend by losing
to St. Olaf 91‘s!) and whipping
Carleton 81-65. The Pioneers
came back on Saturday after
the tough Friday night over-
time loss to play a great game
which broke a five-game con-
ference losing streak.

The St. Olaf game was a real
tough affair, in which the score
was tied eleven times, Ted Ris-
ser personally kept Grinnell
in the game for the first six
minutes by scoring the first
eleven Pioneer pointsi

Later St Olaf took its biggest
lead of six points with two min-
utes left in the first half but
two consecutive baskets by Jeff
Frantz and single baskets by
Elliott Hibbs and Dick Ulrich
pushed Grinnell into the lead.
A basket right at the buzzer,
after a steal by Jeff Frantz,
earned Grinnell at 47743 half<
time lead

The second half started with
a basket by Hibbs to give Grin-
nell its biggest lead of six
points. St, Olaf eventually tied
up the game, though, and the
second half was close thereaf~
ter. Two consecutive baskets by
Hibbs gave Grinnell 3 five«
point lead with only 4:30 re-
mainlng.

But St. Olaf rallied and for
the first time in nine minutes

 

took the lead 80-79 with 1:30 left
in the game. Two free throws
by Hibbs with forty seconds re-
maining gave Grinnell its last
lead 81-80. After Eric Grimsrud
had tied the score for St. Olaf,
Jeff Nelson, the game's high
scorer, made two free throws
with nine seconds left, When
Jeff Frantz came down and
swished a twenty-five foot jump
shot with one second remain-
ing, the game was sent into
overtime

In the overtime Grinnell was
never able to take the lead
Finally with the game tied,
Nelson won the game for the
01:35 91-89 with a jump shot
with three seconds left.

The junior forward Jeff Nel-
son led all scorers with 32
points. Eric Grimsrud and
Dave Heise, a couple of sharp-
shooting guards, added 21 and
19 points respectively. Jeff
Frantz again led the Pioneers
with 22 points while Elliott
Hibbs notched 21.

As usual the Pioneers were
weak in rebounding. They could
only capture 26 rebounds which
St. Olaf’s two big forwards,
Dennis Olson and Fred Russler
matched by themselves. The
Oles as a team brought down
49 rebounds. Grinnell was also
hurt at the foul line where it
could only sink 15 of 27 free
throws

like a house afire by scoring the
first nine points before Hibbs
could break the ice for Grin-
nell, The Pioneers fought back
though and crept within four
points with 5:30 left in the first
half. In the next seven minutes
the Pioneers rattled off fifteen
consecutive points and took a
32-21 lead, Grinnell held on and
took a 38-29 lead at half-time.

Grinnell then started pulling
away as the second half pro-
ceededr Even though Ted Ris-
ser and Tom Hill fouled out,
Carleton could never start any
kind of a rally. Carleton, be<
hind by fifteen points with time
running out, applied a despera-
tion press but the Pioneers

rolled on Included were ten ‘,

straight points scored by lead-
ing scorer Jeff Frantz, Grin-
nell took its biggest lead of 21
points with 4:25 remaining The
Pioneers finally took an 81-55
victory.
Jeff
with 38 points, He hit on 16 of
28 shots from the floor and 6
of 1 free throws Dick Chap

Frantz led all scorers ‘

nears then were nearly equal
to Carleton in rebounds—losing
only 34-32.

The Pioneers also improved
their defense. Against St, Olaf
the Pioneers employed a 1-3-1
zone defense if they had just
scored and a man-to—man de-
fense if they did not score.
Against Carleton they used the
man—to-man exclusively. The
Pioneers also used their man-
to-man press for both games,
The defense seemed a little
sharper by forcing more out-
side shots and allowing fewer
shots right under the basket.
