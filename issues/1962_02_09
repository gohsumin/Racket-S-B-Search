FORUM

by Cameron Hendershot

There has been much discus-

on this year about the grouu

g disinterest of students in
running lor the major campus
government oﬁices. Last year‘s
elections brim-ca a case in pomt.
a total of nine pebple ran for
the top ﬁve positions.

The consensus seems to be
that, as the academic pressures
increase with the resulting de-
mands on time, there will be
even less interest in assuming
ihe burdens :0; leadership.

Two alternatives present them-
selves. One would be to return
lo the administration some of
the responsibilities p r e s e 1i t l y
held by student government.
Tlehher the administration nor
the student body seems to want
lhis. The other alternative then
would be to strive toward, pro-
(edurai changes which would
lessen the work load or the top
oﬁicers while still maintaining

an eﬂective and responsible

government.
One such prohosnl inward

efficiency will be voted upon
by the Senate next week. This

What are the Objections that
might be raised to such a pro-

lead to the formation of politi—
cal parties on campus has often
been Cited. The causal relation
seems rather tenuous. Political
parties are not 11l’ltlen into the
constitution; they must evolve
out of popular illtci’e . The
real key to the formation of
parties lies in the legislative
and not the executive branch.
AS long a: the senators are

elected by halls and not campus-
wide, such all evolvemont is
highly unlikely.

A second argument might
be that this change breaks
down the separation 01 powers
and gives too much inﬂuence
to the executive. The farmer
part of the argument .is amply
refuted by the legal prece-
dents existing in both national
and state governmenLS. The
latter part needs careful deﬂ—
nltion. The kind and degree
of inﬂuence must. he noted.
The major change would be
flint the Executive Cabinet

dent would be guaranteed full

Speaker would no longer :be

One last argument should be
dismissed, It is that the Campus

dential candidate in :1 “package

To the editor:

in his letter last week Denton
Fox sccmcd to segregate life
into two spheres which he iccls
1111 not belong together: action
and thought. His implications
were that the college years are
those when a student selects a
philosophical. economic, and pi»
litlcal position, and the other
years of his litc are those in
which he acts on those views to
which he commits himself.

c P. siiuiv, in “Two Cultures,"
points to this view as a procure
ions trend among intellectuals tar
day and suggests that the solu—
tion lies not in assigning only :1
few years pl life for the study 01
art, literature, history, philosophy
and science, but rather giving
these areas and thought to the
questions aiising in theln,

Unlike the scllolastics of me-
dieval Europe, we cannot absorb
all there is to be learned today.
Our world demands specializa-
tion. Yet I would suggest that
it" a liberal arts education is to
be meaningful in our lives, we
must integrate this breadth of
thought into our Specialization
and our daily llVlng.

Educators recommend the
student approach his subject
matter with questions in order
to gain the greatest vuluc from
it, and the men wbuse books
we read and whose ideas we
analyze are attempting to ans-
wer questions which arose
from lheir experience.

Certainly this is the case with
Aristotle, Machievelli, Burke,
Marx, Freud, and Sartre. justrta
mention a few. The student who
struggles with the relationship
between thought and action and
who discovers at a significant
level ihe frustratlons of commun-
ity living is most likely to ap-
proach his study with some of
the same questions.

in the "Public Philosophy‘
Walter Lipnlann comments on
this relationship between ideas
and the “existential world.
“Wily do men make mistakes?
Because an iniporiani part of hu-
man behavior 5 reaction to the
pictures in their heads.

“Human behavior takes place
in relation to a pseudo-envirorr
me'nt — a representation. which
is not quite the same for any two
individuals, of what they suppose
to be 7not what is — the real-
ity of things.

"This mummade ,ihis cultural
environment, which hds its be-
ing in the minds of men, is inlei»
posed between man as a biolog~
icdl organism and the external
reality. It is in this realm that
ideas are eiiicacious . . . The airy
nothings in the realm of essence
are efficacious in the existential
world when a man ,believing it
to be true or good. treats the
idea as if it were the reality.”

I would contend, then, that
college is not n' place im-
“thinking” alone, but an oppor—
tunity ‘for the student to test
these ideas of other men as
well as his own, mid when he
has made mistakes to eval-
unte his action wilh intelli-
gencc.

The ability to ariiculule ideas
is not dependent upon uic ideas
alone, but derives from many
nnsuccesslul attempts to express
them. Just because the student
has listened to and read many
critical analyses of literary
works. he is not able in make 1
critical evaluation of a war}:
himself: usually it requlres many
trials on his own part. The stu-
dent making the lrip to Wash-
ingion had given considerable
thought and study to the ideas
they were purporting, but it was
necessary for them to make the
trip to prove or disprove the
eliicacy. oi their ideas,

“Lil Dulce
and “The

Movies. such as
Vita," "L'Al'mttill‘a,”
Seventh Seal." are indications
that in our time a new art
medium is in the process oi be—
ing realized and perfected. While
foreign ﬁlm companies are pro—
ducing works of creditable sta—
ture, however, the American
ﬁlm industry, the oiiginal pio»
neer, with its great wealth or
resources. has taken another
tack, sensationalism. Succinctly,
it has turned toward the large
rather than the beautiful.

This is not a. condemnation.
The American ﬁlm industry
can do something that no oth-
er country in the world can
do; that is, produce a. tech»
nically periect movie oi such
awesome proportions that
words like “colossal" and “stu-
Ipent'laus" are inadequate to
describe it,

But still, there seems to be no
reason why, having outdistanced
all others in technique, we can.
not turn now to producing sub-
stantial works of art as well.
At this point, you think I’m
about to say that the ﬁlm in-
dustry merely mirrors what the
public wants and the American
public has long ago been irre-
vocably vulgarized by large
breasts and loud noises. But i
don't believe that this is the
case.

it an uneducated Elizabethan
peasant could trudge into Lon-
don in order to see “Hamlet”
performed and could cnjoy it,
there is no reason why the
comparable cannot be true ot
a twentieth Century American.
Perhaps the problem paradox-
ically arises from the very fact
that the American ﬁlm industry
is the richest in the world. At
any single moment, an audience
can be convinced that it is
equally as moved by massive.
ness as artistry, and it mas.
Sireness is the more expensive
to produce, it is by the same
token. the less elusive.

As a result, many ﬁlms here
are repositories tor stock tim-
matic conventions; the deeper
the love the greater the pass
sion; silence denotes strength;

a by Mike Horwatt

The recent controversy relate
ing to the questions of whether
student government should take
stands on political issues and
whether students should cone
cern themselves with current
political problems suggests the
larger question of the academic
community's [responsibility to
the “outside” world. My next
tour columns will consider this
problem.

Enduring social orders must
be adaptable. Changes within
the political, economic and social
order create the need for philo-
sophical and institutional ad-
justments. .A large order for
any society is to, on the one
hand, preserve the values and
goals upon which it claims to
be established and at the same
time rid itseli or beiieis and in-
stitutions made obsolete by
changing conditions. Thus, the
‘capacity of a society to sustain
its ultimate ends and its per-
manent existence is contingent
upon its capacity to accommo-
date to change.

Within less than a hundred
years irom its inception, the
united states was transtorm.
ed train an atomistic, agricul—
tural, commercial society into
an interdependent, industrial
manniactining society. in the
process, problems unanticipats
ed by the Constitution-makers
arose. Til ir appearance (Ice

old ends. i

Yet, as oitcn happens, our

have strong accents; and so
on.

On the other hand, foreign
ﬁlm companies, in a sense, have
nothing else to oiter the public
and so must make their movics
artistic \\'oJ‘I'< in order to com-
pensate tor inadequacies in tech-
nical resources. And the artistry
or such a movie does not his
volve the grain of the ﬁlm or
the size of the cost. it depends
upon other taetors.

For example. in “The Seventh
Seal," the scene cuts from the
face oi the silent girl, who is
smiling because she is con—
tronted with Death, to the lace
of Mary, who is smiling be.
cause she is eenirontcd with
life. I can’t help thinking that
Hollywood would have missed
this and that the cut would
have been, say, irom Dcath‘s
right eye to doorknob or
something equally as inane.

And the casting would have
been entirely ditterent. Marlon
Brando would have played Jolls,
Rock Hudson would have been
Antonius Block, and Joseph
would have been played by
someone like Pinky Lee.

Most likely the script would
have to he changed, loot Jons
and the silent girl would have
a lender love scene to Henry
Blancini, God would spcak at
least once, Joseph would have
saved the Witch, and the
knight would be rescued at
the last minute by an angel.

At any rate, whatever the
reasons, the American ﬁlm in~
dustry has fallen behind those
of other countries artistically.
And this is perhaps something
to keep in mind, when we con-
sider that in the future. the
twentieth century will be r
member-ed not only for its
bombs and satellites but also
very possibly for the advent ot
a new art medium, the motion
picture.

call these valucsinvested means
“the cake ol custom." Most civ—
ilizations. he remarks, retain
their original form and ideas.
For this reason, ”stagnation is
the rule of the world and prog—
ress is the rare exception,” How
does ‘a society iacilitate change?
According to legchot.

“it a‘ nation luls in any con—
siderable degree gained the
habit, and exhibited the capac-
ity to discuss these questions
tthe questions involving the
visible and pressing interests
oi the community) with freer
dam, and to decide them with
discretion, to argue much on
politics and not to argue ruin-
ously, an enormous advance
in other kinds oi civilization
may conﬁdently be predicted"
While Bdgehol's claim sullers

from Enlightenment optimism,
there is much to be said tor his
argument, There are a signlﬁs
cant number in our society lilo
are still capable o[ recogn 'ng
and reacting to truth it they
are only exposed to it. Criticism
then is a device capable of en.
couraging social change and
consequently inci’eas s the adap

Since a society's ability to
survive is proportional to its
on' ity to acconnnotiate,arrd
criticism through discus on is
a lorce tor change, ‘

Americans fight Communism in South Vietnam

dangers involved in conducting
American toreign policy.

This country isn't viewed by
many Asians as the showplnce

by Paul D. Samuel

The Americans may be war»
mad about the Russians, the Cu-
bans may fear the Americans.
and the French may be watching
the Algerians. But all ct these
problems, and many others, have
become the concern of Grinnell’s
international Relations club, for
all of them have to do with the
politics or other lands and other
peoples.

The Inc is Gi-innell's biggest
student organization, having over
420 members, more than onc<
third of the student population.
There are also fire or six lactlls
ty members who belong to the
club. while other iacuity, ale
though not IRC members, have
ing reguarly attended many at
the meetings. The ice tor meme
bet-ship is one dollar a year, or
so cents a semester.

Dan Figgins is president oi
IRC. He is a politi al science
maior, and is active in other
campus organizations, including
thc Friars and the Young Re»
publieans. He is a former na-
tional Vicesprcsidcllt of the Cole
legiate Council tor the United
Nations (CCUN),

Under Figgins, the Inc has
almost doubled its membership
in the past yeah The increas-
cd iunds which it has reccived
have enabled its board oi di—
rectors to secure better speak—
ers and more interesting events
tor its members. But there are
other, more important reasons,
[0 belonging to the club.

”We have two goals, an im—
mediate one and a long—range
one,” Figgins said. “Our immed-
iate goal is to give our members
better and more personal con—
tact with the speakers who come
here to address the [HQ

This would be impossible with
more than 400 people, but by
breaking the club down into
small groups, it is easier to give
the students a chance to meet
and to speak with the persons
who address them it

"Our longsi'ange goal, on thc
other hand ,exlcnds iar past our
lives as students at Grinncll We
wish to give America a more
inlormed citizenry, one which
can exert pressure toward the
government in the hope of male
ing it a better government. We.
like to think that we are malt»
ing progress toward this objec»
tiVC.”

In addition to eating meals
with speakers, there are other
activities which a student can
participate in only it he is a
member or me. These include
weekend trips to nearby con—
ierenccs and conventions (such
as the Foreign students Cons

CAMPUS

by Ann Fetter

six juniors were asked the
following question: What is
your reaction to the junior lib-
eral arts comprehensive exam-
ination'!

Nancy Lee Norton

”It the administration plans to
institute these examinations as a
graduation requirement they
should dcvi a schedule which
gives all juniors an equal a-
mount oi preparation time. Since
1 was beginning three lower oli-
vision courses this semester, ‘1
had an ~ernely short reading
period. In addition I found the
syllabus unduly redundant."

Steve Aldrich

“I think that the liberal arts

exam should be retained; how-
ever, an inordinate weight was
placed on the Area test. While
recognizing the ditiicuity of
testing and grading the essay
sections fairly, 1 feel that as the
kinks are ironed out more
weight should be given to them
since more preparation and test
ing time was devoted to them.
The essay tests require a deep-
er understanding of the subject
matter than do the area tests,"

Linda Brayman

“My main criticism of the proA
gram was the lack of direction
given to us. I thought that the
philosophy behind the tests was

sound i enjoyed reading in

-the seven or

abroad as dreams come +rue

by Peg Pennington

The dream of a summer in
Europe is becoming a reality tor
millions of college studcn
Such an experience is capable
of giving the student, as no col-
lege course can, an integrated
and graphic picture or the baclc
ground and pro nt state or
Western civ ization.

Con idering the
tial value that such a trip can
,assumo, ll. seems almost tragic
|that with so many students, it
lbecomes a irustrated attempt
to fathom the hearts of individ-
uals and nations in a Ilmiled
lperiod of two or three weeks.
All too often such a trip be-
.comes a named transit through
1numerous cities and countries,
a neve ending tussle with hotel
reservations and ll‘aln connec-
tions.

Classrooms Abroad was
founded in 1955, under the
premise that one can experi—
ence only one area in a suin-
mer with any degree oi thor—
oughness and hope ioi- any
lasting results. Under this
program, students study in-
tensively cithcr French, Ger-
man, Spanish or Italian, while
living with a family in a
characteristic city. The lainily
is instructed to speak only
the language or the country
with its guests.

in 1962, Classrooms Abroad
will consist of eleven groups—
lour French-language g r o u p s,‘
four German-language groups,
two spani h-longuogc groups
and one Italian branch.

Each group will consist of 20
to 30 students who will be in—
structed in small sections or
seven to ten members during
eight weeks of
their residence. The plan is in»
tended to give them at least the
equivalent of one year of col—
lege language training.

The formal instruction will be
supplemented by inlormnl get:

which our local state and na—

‘The function of state and local

only be handled by further
executive reorganization, such
as took place in the recent
State Department shakeup.

As far as the basic, long range

them as threefold. I

Cagers Ila/cl first place tie; face l/iltingsand Redme

Weekend duels
to test leaders

The Pioneers continue their
heavy cage action this weekend
as they hit the road once more
to meet Lawrence on Friday
night and Ripon Saturday after-~
noon.

Coach John Pfltsch classified
the weekend’s contests as “must
games.” as he believes the cag-
ers need these games to hang
onto their share of first place.

Lawrence, at the bottom of the
Conference heap with a 0.10
mark, should not be tough for
the Pioneers to top, but the Vik—
ings will be looking for the big,
upset. Lawrence's leading- scor-
ers are Joel Ungrodt, with 16.5
a game, and Jim Jordan, with
14.5,

Ripon, on the other hand, has
a big ,tough squad, which ac-'
cording to Coach Pfitsch. runs
both hot and cold. He added
that after seeing the Redmen
knock off Cornell Monday night.
he couldn’t understand how
they had lost six Conference
games.

At Ripon the Pioneers will
have to contend with the big—
gest forwards iii the Conference,
as starters Bruce White, Diek
Papke, and Gary Mervis all
stand over 6-5. in their first
meeting of the season these
three held the boards. but the
Grinnell cagers were able to
outrun and outshoot the Redmen
in gaining the victory. Also John
Sundell, Grinnell‘s 6.7 center
was injured and -did not play
in the first encounter of the two
clubs.

Scarlet; Faver

By Jim Hcrzog _
“Operation Migration" will long be remembered by the Pie.
iieer backers who travelled by bus and car to Monmouth and

Knox for the six weekend events. _

At friendly Monmouth, it was soon noticed in the unbiased
student newspaper, the “Oracle,” that only Friday night's has.
ketball game was previewed. The swimmers were conscientious-
1y overlooked. and the matnient could have been thumbiwrest-
lers as far as the “Oracle" was concerned. .

1n the basketball preview an‘ unidentified Monmouth writer
penned the following superb phraseology:

Grim-tell is so confident of victory that some 100 (sic)
students have announced in advance that they will he com~
ing over in buses and cars to celebrate “the Yioneer will over
Monmouth."

 

There is no fitting comment that 1 can make cxcept to as.
sure the Grinncllians that no such tripe will appear in the Scar.
let and Black.

After the Pioneers proved they were anything but DVCr-,

confident by‘fighting hard and losing to tho Scots, the hackers
and athletes alike went to the Custer Hotel. in Galcsburgr 111., to

seek a night's repose.

At least the athletes went to sleep; but the “Migratol's,” with
nothing on the agenda till 1:30 Saturday afternoon, held an “lrish
Wake" which may have precipitated the Custer's last stand.

Then after proudly and loudly cheering the swimmers and
wrestlers on to victory, an afternoon of bridge in the Knox

‘ Union began That night the Pioneer athletes picked up their

third Win of the day, and the successful Weekend ended.

I'd like to add that the only effect of the Migration was good,
that the backers cheered the various teams on to five victories in
six contests, and that Coach John Pfitsch felt the Migration was
extremely beneficial to the Pioneers.

Finally, the Pioneer backers displayéd fine sportsmanship '-

throughout the weekend. Their fine attitude Was exemplified by
the standing ovation they gave Jeff Sandburg of Knox when he
had to be helped off the Court after painfully reinjuring his
shoulder.
