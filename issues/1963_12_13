Expansion of PPPE Inte

ship

Enabled I) y Falk Gift of $4500 ,

Grinnell College has been
given a $4,500 grant by the
Maurice and Laura Falk Foun-
dation for an expansion of the
college's Program in Practical
Political Education political in—
ternship program.

The grant, announced by Dr.
J, Steele Gow, executive di-
rector of the foundation, locat-
ed in Pittsburgh, P8,, will be
used to inaugurate a series of
student internships in political
reporting.

These internships will be in
addition to the existing sum-
mer and fall programs that
place Students with candidates
or political party headquarters.

Under the expanded pro-
gram, during each semester,
four Grimell students will
spend eight hours a week for
10 weeks working with the As-
sociated Press and the United
Press International in Des
Moines.

“Since this is the first time,
to our knowledge, that such
student press internships have
been attempted in the us,"
Dr. Gow says, “the Falk
Foundation is happy to spon-
sor this novel and promising
program for a three-year pe-
riod.”

With the new program to be-
gin early next February, Dr.
C, Edwin Gilmour, director of
the P.P.P.E. said that the se-
lected students will have the
“unique opportunity to obtain
insights, experiences, and in-
spiralion into and from the pp.
litical process, as seen by the
political reporter,"

Specific plans will have the

 

student interns assigned to as-
sist in the political coverage
of the State House, the State
Legislature, and the stale head-
quarters of the two major po-
litical parties.

The Student will work with
and under the supervision of
political reporters, following an
orientation period. In addition
to writing straight news
stories, they will also do re-
search and Write feature stories
concerning political f i g u r e s
and events. A

Each student will spend a to-
tal of eight hours a week in the
internship, and will be paid at
the rate of $1.25 an hour, or
$10.00 a week. Transportation
between Grinnell and D e s
Moines will be furnished by
the PPPE. The intern will not
be paid for the approximately

 

four hours weekly spent in
travel.

To tie the internship experi-
ence directly into the academic
program of the College, each
intern will be required to em
roll for an Independent Prol-
eCt 397493. Under the direction
of Herbert Prescott (English-
Journalism) or C. Edwin Gil-
mour (Political Science), thq
intern will complete a mean-
ingful reading or research as-
signment relating to the interm
ship experience.

Participation in the program
is open to all Grinnell students,
regardless of class standing or
academic major. Interested
students are asked to contact
Prescott or Gilmour imme-
diately, since selection of the
February interns must be
made prior to registration for
the second semester.

,Grinnell's Future

1 Sunday’s Boar’s Head, 3 traditional Christmas dinner,
lrupted into a two and one half hour display of foul language
and foul manners, as the men of North Campus treated their
faculty guests be an unceasing volley of four-letter words in
the form of inappropriate toasts and uncalledvlor chants.

‘ The guests reacted quickly and strongly to the humorless
display of crudity. At first the faculty members simply concen-
trated on the failings of the men at that meal. Winston King
(philosophy and religion) on Monday afternoon delivered an an-
gry denunci Lion of me event. However, today the 18 faculty
guests delivered a letter to students which goes far beyond the
Boar’s Head incident, The faculty said, ”This (the Boar’s Head)
is not an isolated incident.” It continued that the dinner was but
a symptom of a greater problem, that the college “cannot have

its character determined by individual and group lrresponsi»
bility."

“The alteration of rules has brought neither maturity nor
satisfaction to the students. The faculty has seen the academic
life it zealously guards seriously weakened by the communal
problems that it has sought to avoid. We have, in short, reached
.Ihe point in the lifeof Ihis college in whch there must be a sober
reconsideration of internal operations if we are to remain effec-
tive as an educational institution," me faculty members stated.

The letter suggested a reevaluation of the hall system, of
the role of the faculty in the social area, of the time and effort
given by students to college government, and of “the proper re-

atlonship of the two residential campuses to each other and to

the total life of the College."

The letter closed, “We hope that something positive and cons
structivc will follow recent eVenIs that have troubled us. The
residential college necessarily restricts a student’s freedom.
(Those students who find the limitations inherent in such an in4
ﬁitution should seek other places for their education. We be-
lieve, however, that there is a value in this kind of a college,
and we are determined to preserve it. We express our willing-

ness to participate in a program for the reconstruction of a
united college community,”

James Hr Stauss, Acting President of the college, followed
that letter with a statement. In that statement he noted, “The
college has liberal policies pertaining to the student culture.
.Yet, insofar as these take the form of rules, there is widespread
disrespect of them, More importantly, there is frequent viola»
tion of the premises upon which the college has approached
student affairs — namely, that individual standards and prac<
titles will reflect individual selfrrestraint, responsibility, and
common sense.”

Preoccupation with college rules has not succeeded in imv
proving either the rules or the college.”

“Means must be found to achieve a ‘settling down’ to the

main business of me college and to behavior appropriate to the
ideals of the college."

We find no argument with these statements, but can only
agree with them and with Peter Cohan, Cofl-lP President; Jack
Chapman, SGA President and Marie Martin, AWS Board Presi-
dent; who said in a joint statement, ”The communty is ailing.
it is time for all factions to forget about being opponents . . I
.The community has now recognized and accepted the problem
as its own and seems willing to act on it. This has the potential
for being the first step toward a serious appraisal of our sys-
tem, the society it supports and promotes and the mechanics of
communication and intervactlon in that society,"

The statement concluded, “We would urge an honest and
critical assessment of the community so that steps may be tak-
In to help us regain our equilibrium as rapidly as possible.”

Before us we have the statements of all three factions, all
zﬁering to cooperate. We can only add our agreement and our
ope that if action follows, it will be jointlaction.

Olcl S&B's Throw Colcl Light
On Past Christmas Seasons

By Karen Adkinson

Grinnell College has been an
ongoing organization for over
one hundred years, but rarely
do students have a sense of this
continuity. Some link with the
past can be gained by thumb-
ing through back issues of the
8&3 for the weeks around
Christmas time. Here can be
seen not only the great changes
in the school, but also the con»
tinuing concerns.

December 31, 1919

"Grinnell College will hold
classes as usual during New
Year’s day according to the an-
nouncement of the administra»
tion this morning. . . ." This
move was caused by a “fuel va-
cation" when Grinnell ran out
of coal to heat the buildings.
Smith and Mears were kept
heated during the fuel break by
wood supplied by a crew of
(student) wood cutters.

December 15, 1937

"Roads about Grinnell and
vicinity are at present impas»
sable, according to a statement
released today by the Iowa
state highway commission.”

Announcement of the results

Not Boar's Head
But Boar's Head

Dear Dr. King,

The men of'CLARK HALL
would like to express their come
plete agreement with your let-
ter condemning the actions of
the men of Grinnell College at
the Boar‘s Head dinner. Many
have stated that this was a
“mild” affair in comparison
with some dinners of past years
and have thereby wrongly tried
to pass it off and excuse their
own poor taste.

Although the men of CLARK
can proudly say that not one
of us allowed our sense of pro-
portions to become unbalanced,
We feel that because we were
a part of the men of the cam-
pus we must express our sin—
cerest apologies for the disre-
spect shown to you, to the
o t h e r distinguished guests,
and to the student body itself.

CLARK HALL

Ed. Note: This letter was
sent both to Winston King (re-
ligion) and the 5&3.

Pursell to Visu School

Dr. Lyle E. Pursell, associ-
ate professor of mathematics
at Grinnell College, will be a
“visiting scientist” on Friday
(Dec. 20) at the Story City
Community Sc h 0 01 in Story
City.

As a participant in the pro-
gram, Dr. Pursell will give
demonstrations, hold informal
discussions, speak to science
and mathematics classes, and
talk to interested students in-
dividually at the high school.

The program. now in its
fourth year, is sponsored by
the Iowa Academy of Science,
the State University of Iowa,
and the National Science Foun-
dation. - . -‘ '

 

of the annual freshman eti~
quette test revealed Grinnell

The women‘s average was a
scant 10 points higher.

letter to the editor

"Athletics at Grinnell are un-
derestimated, not overempha-
sized. Successful teams are the
financial backbone of th e
school, and if Grinnell is to con-
tinue in operation in the face of
its mounting deficit, there must
be more concentrated effort
. . . to bring in good high school
athletes."

cency. But we have small

Winston L. King Scorns Boar's Head,
Says Student Courtesy ls lacking

To Everybody at Grinnelli

You took the words right out
of my mouth: The amazing ma-
turity of Grinnell students! I
have been hearing those magic
words from Grinnell student
leaders for a long time. But
now, after attending the Boar’s
Head Dinner, I know what they
mean!

What a splendid spirits-
filled demonstration of ma-
ture masculinity it was! What
COURTESY and CONSIDER-
ATION to trustees and faculty
dining with them — a con-
tinual raucous yelling and
booing which made it'impos-
sible for any of the cere~
monial and most of the toasts
to be heard, or Christmas
carols to be sung — except
when the animals were feed-
ing! What VIGOR — whole
tables full of GROWN-UP
men chanting Obscenities at
the tops of their voices]
What IMAGINATION ,- a
tremendous variety of at least
two of those vigorous four-
letter words straight off the
walls of men‘s washrooms
and grade-school prlvies,

used over and over again in
all sorts of fascinating com-
binations! What COURAGE
rising to shout insults at col-
lege officials from the safe
anonymity of a buzzing
crowdl

It does one’s heaIt good to
see such a resounding demon-
stration of those qualities
which make Grinnell great and
her students ready for adult
FREEDOM. We must have at-
tained to at least a ten, maybe
even a twelveryear old level of
conduct on that occasion. Fif-
tee more years of development
at this rate will surely result
in some sort of super-maturity.
And let’s wait for another
Boar’s Head dinner that long,
too!

Winston L._ King (religion)

P.S. We’re sorry that those
really mature junior women
who heard the “program" from
under the HeadrTable plat;
form, after “hiding" there for
four hours, couldn’t have heard
it all, but were just able to get
out in time to have their pic-
tures taken ‘vith the grown-
ups.

 

Adult Problem N

To the editorl

Both the, Boar's Head Din-
ner and Winston King’s angry
letter “to everybody at Grin-
nell" manifest frustration over
a situation which, despite
much well meant conversation,
has not found a workable solu-
tion.

The men of Grinnell want the
right to govern dremselves as
“grown ups", yet childishly
(if amusingly) stuck out their
tongues at those College lead-
ers who must ultimately de-
cide whether we are responsi»
ble enough to behave without
their supervision.

Dr. King Wants mature Grin-
nell students, yet can do no

eeds Compromise

our adolescent fannies. The
students won’t behave until
they're treated as adults, The
administration Won't treat stu-
dents like adults until they be-
have.

- This situation has been the
topic for heated debates bee
tween administration, faculty,
and student leaders. but no
workable compromise has
emerged, or seems pending. A
compromise is necessary.
Now, instead of planning for
the future and looking away
from the very real ugliness
of the Boar‘s Head and of Dr.
King’s letter, let us face and
work with the contemporary
problem. everybody at Grin-
nell.

Letter Provokes Reply from Clymer

To the editon

As an interested observer
connected in a minor way with
the SSzB. ! find myself some-

what dismayed at the ramer
irresponsible and childish et—
titude of the editor and certain
members of his staff in regard
to the editor-elect. I get the
impression that Jim Herzog is
behaving like a spoiled child
who has just had his favorite
toy taken away.

I was interested to note that
the new editor will be permit-
ted to publish issues No. 13 and
No 15 at the discretion of
Herzog, Issue No. 13 will ap-
pear the first week after va-
cationi Not only will this be a
short week for the newspaper
staff (they cannot begin work
before Monday), but the job
of getting out the paper will be
even more difficult due to final
examinations the following
week Issue No. 15 will appear
during the interim period, a
time singularly devoid of news.
By selecting these two difficult
issues for Lynn Denzler, Herr
zog demonstrates his lack of
maturity

Why was Merrit Ludwig’s
personal memo to the editor
published? It was obviously not
intended for publication but ap-
peared to be simply a personal
request for information on
some important questions i
believe the editor has every
right to editorialize on any
topic from the situation in
Lower Slobbovia, to a liberal-
ization of the car rule, to the
change in editorship of the
S&B..I do object however. to
editorials in the form of news
stories. memos not intended
for publication, etc.

Frosh Cagers
Whip Knights

Although handicapped by a
lack of height and by spotty m-
bounding, Grinnell’s freshman
basketball team bounced back
in the second half last Satur-
day to hand the Wartburg Col-
lege fresh an 80774 defeat in
Darby Gym.

Throughout the first half the
junior Pioneers were held in
check by the taller Knight
squad. In the second half for-
ward Dick Lovell and center
Jim Rhodes sparked the Scar-
let eifort with their fine [‘87
bounding, While guard Elliott
Hibbs poured in most 01 his 28
points. The Pioneers took over
the lead for good with nine
minutes remaining and built up
a six point margin.

Coach Dick Young cited Lov-
ell’s rebounding and Hibbs' fine
over-all play as two reasons
for the good showing in the
second half. “During the first
half we tried some of the var-
sity plays but we weren’t too
successful so we settled down
in the second half to our basic
stuff and it payed eff," com-
mented Young. “1 think our
better conditioning also helped
us a lot. offhand I‘d say this
is fundamentally the best
freshman team we've had here
in several years."
