ed, as before. by the editor.

Loard should contact Jim Hatfield, ext. 540.

The cour’r problem

After a full year of operation three areas of basic
problems, three “sore spots" in the student court system.
:re becoming increasingly apparent. Students must honest-

ijl investigate the problems of procedure, personnel and

, lriSdictional distinctions in legal apparatus of the court.
The major problem is procedural. Tlle by-laws of the
courts, both primary and high court, have been written and
rewritten with negli the
court’s handling of cases has (il'lVOllldeel‘lt‘ientS to anger
and caused a confusion for er l'rone concerned that is llll‘
co ducive to an atmosphere 01‘ effective judicial decision.
Procedural inconsistencies have placed the student ill
I disadvantageous position when appearing before the court.
Ignorance and inel iciency in this problem area is making
conducive to all atmosphere of effective judicial decision,
' The personnel “sore spot" is characterized by a kind
of “judicial informality" practiced by the justices outside
the courtroom. Proceeding of the court arevsoinetimes
discussed indiscretely with friends of or the defendants
themselves paralleling the sloppiness within the court
room This does great harm to the prestige of the court
and may render all impartial decision extremely difficult.
In‘flormality is not a luxury in which the court can in-
dulge. l

The problem of court personnel is a thorny one, but
i 5 basis is not in the character of the court justices but
in the peculiar burdens of their office. The outmoded na-
ture 01 some of the rules which must be enforced present
a c is' of conscience on the part of prospective justices
which is hard to resolve holict‘ Who is ”without blame"?
Who can ”cast the first stone“.7

Finally, a distinction must be delinitrely made be
tween the province of college administration jurisdiction

ld student coult jurisdiction. It is becoming clear that
the court will never be completely free of administrative
control, bill the roles of these two elements, the court and
the administration, must be written down.

The unsatisfactory lllodlls operandi now in e'lst'ellcc
must be abandoned; the “rules of the game" have to be
(refined. If the court is to act effectively it must have in-
dependence within its own province. There will be admin,
'st/r tion limits on the court's treedom to act, but these liln-
l s will be set»down and known. The game can then be play
ed accordingly.

is necessary to Show that many

From 1937 to 1945 this revo-

some or his contradictions,
which we might sup are Latin

Sistance. No gun was lired. no

year old dictator was nominated
as candidate to the presidency
and Surpl‘ ingly won with a
large majority of votes. I am
just trying to Show that dicta-
tors are not always hated, and
also have limitations to their
powers, In Latin America no-
body can rule without Complete
support of the Amy, Navy and

for the people oi this Country to
realize how and why the Armed
Forces play Such an important
role in LA politics. But the fact
is that they can either oust or
back whoever they want in pow—
er.

Goal; industrialization

The big present goal of any
LA nation is industrialization.
But industrialization is also con-
nected with a lot of problems.
If LA gets suddenly fully indusr
trialized, would not that cause
a depresssion in the U. s. and
Europe? One fact, though, seems
to be true about all LA nations:
if thel is one thing lo be avoidr
ed, h is the status quo. If this
change occurs fast or slowly it
does not seem to mailer. What
really matters is the way it is to
be achieved,

Another tact seems also to
be tru - as m as A gels in-
dustr lizeli there will be less
chance oi communist dictator-
ship. LA nations becoming sell—

standard of living for their in-
habitniits, the danger of com.

When a Latin American looks
at Red China 0)’ Russia, he ﬁnds
some similarity between Soviet
and Chinese leaders and the dice

Students offer varied opinions or
question regarding womenls hours

Question: What is your
opinion or women’s
hours regulations? Do
you think they should
bc altered?

Greg Strawn: “Yes. There
shouldn’t be any hours rules.
But since we Can’t have a 110-
hours system, they should at
least be extended on weekends."

Donna Cunningham: “I think
they should be more ﬂexible,

Its silly to be campused it
you‘re one minute late.”

Gretchen Geycr: “I think hours
are unnecessary. i think the
college would ﬁnd that the stu-
dents would establish their own
hours."

Gar Srnith: “1 like the way
they are now. They're liberal
enough. If they (the administra-
tion) would liberalize the car
rules then 11 or 11:30 am on
Friday and Saturday nights
would be good."

Barbara Schwonk: “I think
they‘re a tradition that could
be done away with. ii Grin-
nell is getting the responsible
people they say they’re getting
then they should iccl free to
give thom the responsibility
they deserve.” -

John Karlsson: “I don't think

they could be improved much.

Eallinger's last lecture at Grins

cussed three questions; 1) Did
the South African government
intend to withdraw trom the
B tish Commonwealth? 2) How
was the dccision to withdraw
made? 3) what are the political
and constitutional implications
both in South Airican and Com—
monwealth affairs?

Bctorc discussing the questions,
Ballingcr gave a histoiical back-
g1ound to the problem. He
pointed out that South Airica
has always had an ambivalent
and complex attitudc toward

dcterminntion ot' the whites tor

Airikancr Nationalism

Thc asccndcncy or the All‘l-
kaner can be seen in the tact
that every question in cvcry
hold or government action “has
been solved along the lines at
Al'rikaner Nationalism." Ballin»
ger traced the dcvclopmcnt of
the Nationalist party irom its
beginmngs with Hcrtzog, through
its ascendency in 1924. to its den
clinc just before the Second
World War and rise again

Davydd Greenwood: "Under

tance. The problem or the worm

or the necessity for a complete

platiorm had
three planks: 1) Leave Atri-
kaners to develop their own
culture, 2) Make South Airica

11 republic, 3) Complete sov-
creignty.

With power, Hertzog became
more conservative, but the war
and the oucsuon of South Alri-
ca's nontrnhty again brought
the qucstion oi complete sot-c1»
cignty to the fore. During the
\val‘, General Smuts led the
country in lighting on the Allied
Side. However, after the war the
Nationahst party 1osc again
uith a campaign for a republic.

Having proclaimed itself a
icpublic South Airica sent a
delegate to the Commonwcaith
ministei s contcrcncc with an air
plication for admittance lo the
Commonwealth as a republic.
Balliligel‘ contends that South
Africa tclt ties with the Come
monwealtli werc tavorablc to
her. She‘ did not rccl that her
sovereignty was lessciicd by be-
ing a member of the Common-
wealth, particularly attcr the
proclamation had been made
that “all member states of the
Commonwealth were tree and
equal."

The question, then, is what
caused her to change her mind
at the coniercnce? Ballinger
stated that while the confer-
ence discussions started anod-
cratciy, there were ministers
present determined to see the
expulsion of South Africa rrom
the Commonwealth because oi
her internal racial policies.
”Probably the most important

o/a ted, according to Ballinger

hroccdural decision oi the con.
lerence was the decision to
discuss the admission of Sour-.1
Afr-lea to. the Commonwealt'i
and her racial policies at the
same time."

As the discussion proceeded a
iormula appeared, If South A
rica would consent to thc pu
licatlon of a statement condemn
ing her apartheid policy, tl
ministcrs would consider h
admittance to the Comma,

walks, and a wild pitch account
ed for the iuns.

Jack Barker, who can": on
in relic! in the fourth inning,

received credit for the Win
ofvcr the Rams.

After surviving a harrowing
ninth inning, which saw Coe put
its tirst two batters on base,
and then load the bases with
one out, Grinnell pushed across
two runs in the ioth inning to
break a [HS tie and win tlic
game do. -

Coe took a are lead in the iii-st
inning. Grinnell got one oi those
back in the third when Jim
Jenhs blasted his second hoinc
run of the season. Coe retaliate
ed with a single run in the sixth.

Both teams scored twice in
the seventh. Then in the eighth
Grinnell tied the score with
walks to Bruce Bell and Art
Peterson, a single by Dale
Furnish, and a double by Cal
Collier.

The score stood knotted at 6-6
as the teams entered the bottom
of the ninth. A Coe hatter
got an iniield hit to the mound,
and 'chk lMitIclbttsher, the Pio-

neer pitcher who had come on;
in the seventh in reliei of Cole
tier, re-injured his knee on the
play. He stayed in to pitch to
the next batter who hunted Ior
a base hit.

Chris Sprung was then called
in from third to put out the tire.
After getting a force at third,
Sprung walked a batter With
the bases loaded Sprung got the
[inal outs on a pop to the catcher,
and a short fly to lelt.

which the Coe fielder could'
not handle, Furnish and Me.
lntyre came home on the er-

Coach Bowers said the vicel
tory over Coe should put the
squad ina good mental condition
for the weekend. He cautioned"
that a lot of pressure will be
put on the pitchers as the Pio—
neers will play iour games in
as many days.

The team opens the weekend
with an away game at Knox. A

A skin-diving course, an all—day basketball Clinic and

testify to the work John Pfitsch (Director of Intercollegi-
ate Athletics on leave second semester) is doing in Pana-

ma.
-

 

In his role as o YMCA advisor on sports, Plitsch
writes that he is ex 0 ng' his Work and in notes to Mickey
Holmest Sports Ililorlnation Director) has told of some of
lis experiences
One of Pfitsch‘s assignments was to teach a skin-

diving course. But apparently in his vast coaching career
he had never taught skin-(living before. In fact. as
Pfitsch puts, it, “Until now I‘ve never had a flipper on.
.The first series of meetings was on how to handle sharks
underwater—but that’s the way it goesi”

. Then on a more serious assignment Pfitsch has tried
to set up a program in physical fitness. But here again
Pfitsch has been stymied. He says, ”We have no money
and hardly any equipment and a very peculiar attitude of
‘ioing~ nothing today that we can wait to do mzlnana. S0
1 have doubts as to whether the program goes.”

Finally, Pfitsch sends word that two weeks ago he held‘
an all-day basketball clinic for servicemen at Fort Davis,
.which is on the Atlantic side of Panama.

In baseball action, two big bats have been carrying:
the Pioneers. Swinging them are Bob McIntyle, who as
of Tuesday was batting .469 with 15 hits and 13 RBI's,
Quid Jim Jenks. who is hitting at h .353 clip with 12 hits
and 10 RBI’S.

Also McIntyre. who has two home runs, has tied the
school record in that department. In hit‘s right now he’s
tour short of Gary Knamiller’s year-old mark and lacks
one RBI before he can tie the record held by Bill Murray.
