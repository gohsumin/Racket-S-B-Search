ate criteria for channeling federal
funds into water projects,

The book has a iorward by Sen—
ator William Proxmire (D—Wis.)
in which the Senator points out
problems oi inefticiency and waste
in current federal procedures.
Havernan expands this point.

Haveman foresees larger na-
tional returns emerging train the

Religious Liberals
Meet at K lausners'

“This is a ’liberal' campus only

six days or the week," stated pres- _

ident Barry Ancona, as he opened
the first meeting of the Grinneil
Religious Liberals. The organiza-
tion, formerly known as the Grin-
neli Unitarian Group, met Sunday
night at the home of Neal Klaus-
ner (philosophy).

Among the topics discussed at
the initial meeting, besides the
adoption of the new name, was
affiliation With such liberal relig-
ious organizations as the Student
Religious Liberals (Unitarian), the
American Friends Service Com-
mittee, and the American Human-
ists Society.

Dedicating themselves to a
“quest for an open mind," mem-
bers of the group launched the
year's activities With a discussion
of liberalism. Interested students
are invited to attend the next
meeting of the GRL, to be held
at 7 pm, Sunday, Oct, 10, at the
home of Klausnet.

Religion Department
Plans Junior comps

This November will bring some-
thing new to Grinncll besides the.
traditional SAGA turkey and soga
gy dressing. The philosophy and
religion department is introducing
a junior otai exam for its majors.

The purpose of this innovation
is three-fold: give the students
practice for the senior oral comp
(during which one student used
“you know” forty times), acquaint
professors with the new majors,
and diagnose the student’s weak
points.

The junior orais will utilize the
same type of question as the sen-
ior but “will not presuppose a de-
tailed acquaintance and will be
based reallsticaily on work the
student has taken," according to
Howard Burkle, department chair-
man. .

 

SGA Body Again Becomes Senate.
Discusses Hall life. Slum Project

The old organization that was
called the Grinneil Student Senate
—which reorganized last year and
called itself the Advisory Council—
is now the Grinnell Student Senate
—again.

This action came at Wednesday
night’s meeting of the Student

The Senate accepted the com-
mittee recommendation and do
ieated the proposal 17-3. in de-
feating the proposal, various sen-
ators agreed with president Jerry

Goddard when he said that the
grant would be “precedent setting.

 

FIRST THE STUDENT SENATE than the Advisory Council
and now the Student Senate again by unanimoul vote last

Wednesday.

Senate-Advisory Council. The vote
was unanimous.

Twn topics ior discussion cun<
sumed most of the Senate’s time:
the so—called Des Moines project
and the hall system.

Grinneil students interested in a
slum project on the west Side of
Des Molnes met with the ﬁnance
committee and asked the commit-
tee iur fifty dollars a month. The
primary use of the money, the
committee reported, would have
been for the support of Billy King,
a Students for a Democratic So-
ciety worker living in Des Moines
and organizing the project.

We have never subsidized a non-
campus political activity." The
Des Moines project fell into the
category of “political activity"
when it was learned that King
plans to take part in city council
election campaigning.

The hall system discussion came
up as a result of an encampment
report and follow-up coiteehour.
The discussion ot possible chang-
es in the hall system never got
all the ground because the Sena
tors were not so sure that there
is anything wrong With the hall
system as it stands.

WUS Auction
ls Tomorrow

Preparations are underway for
the World UniverSlty S e r V i G 3
(WUS) auction, dance and carnia
val at 8 pm. tomorrow. The an-
nual event will be held in the
North Lounge of the Forum.

A dance with Dick Bailey’s hand
starting at a p.m., a turtle race,
the traditional jail, and a car
wrecking sponsored by the Grin-
nell AFROTC will be among the
evening’s activities.

The main attraction, however.
is the auction. it Will start at ll).
Dick Seers, a professional auc-
tioneer, will conduct the sale of
parties, orgies. stunts, dinners and
other miscellanea to the highest
bidder. Various students and or.
ganizatinns have offered a variety
of items for auction.

The WUS auction is the only
fund raising drive an Camus.
Proceeds from the auction go to
the World University Service to
assist foreign students in quest of
higher education. Grinnell’s con-
tact with Ahmednager College in
india is one of the activities car-
ried on by WUS.

’Exc‘ ed’ Particles
Interest Chemists

Intramolecular photosensitizan
tion was the topic under discus
sion at a meeting of the Grinneil
student-atfiliate chapter of the A-
merican Chemical Society Tues-
day evening.

Dr. Harry Morrison of Purdue
University explored this area of
organic and physical chemistry
with about 30 students and facul-
ty. The topic was complex, and
when the title was ilnally ex-
plained, Dr. Morrison pointed out
that he had spent forty-five min-
utes in the process.

Brieﬂy, he pointed out that light
can be directed at molecules in
such a manner and at such fre-
quencles that the energy level of
the system changes from a normal
“ground" state to one oi several
“excited” states.

The organic chemist usually
deals with material in its ground
state and tinds that completely
new characteristics — reactants,
conditions, mechanisms and prod-
ucts — are available when light-
excited components are used.

Dr. Morrison hadn’t heard at
any particularly practical applica<
tions of this phenomenon but this
is perhaps one of the charming
features of such discussions—41in
potential is unlimited.

Jim Jim, pad}.

By WAYNE STENGEL

It was spring on the Grinnell
College campus. The sun warmly
bathed the faces and backs ot
coeds hurrying to class. Then aud-
denly, with the tyrannical swift-
ness and efficiency of unadulter-
ated power, the omnipresent Grin-
nell administration outlawed the
lunbacked dress on campus.

The 5&8, as always the mouth-
piece of student liberty, leaped to
the defense of its “proletarietle”
with vehement eloquence in a
May 19, I934, editorial sarcastical~
Iy entitled, “1734 or 1934?” “Why
is an expanse of feminine back
bordered by pique or seersucker
immodest, when a border of silk
crepe or crepe cle chine brings
the same object within the bounds
of decency? There is no apparent
explanation; but surely there must
be one, or why the recent decree
torbidding Iun»back dresses on the
Grihnell campus? At I schml
which provides a special smoking
room for its coeds (quite possibly
the first school west of the Missis»
aippi to do so) and allows them
12 o'clock hours on dance nights,
such a puritanical regulation ap-
pears not a little ridiculous. . ,The
instigators of the new ruling would
apparently have {me believe that
the informal low-backed dress is
an invention of the devil and that
only a ‘hussy' would be seen in
one. The average Grinnell coed is
completely capable of judging
what ittirs is in good tnste and
within the bounds of modesty. To
forbid her the right to exercise
this judgment is but to invite the
fiance." (Indeed, Grinnell girls
might start wearing blue jeans all
over campus.)

 

Earlier in that month, May 2,
1934, Wayne Morse, then dean oi
the University of Oregon law
school, addressed Grinnell stll~
dents in a speech at Herrick Chap
el. His analysis of the five types
of college students, though heav-
ily tinged with the social discon-
tent ol the 30’s, is amazingly ap-
plicable to Grinnell students of the
1960’s:

“Five types of students enter
the halls or learning. The tirst type
includes the student who is just
plain indifferent. He goes to col-
lege without knowing why; his
folks foot the bill. He seldom ques-
tions what his professors put forth.

“The constitutional conservative
ialls into the second group. he
finds comfort in the status quo;
why should he argue and dream
and plan and strive tor change?
The here and now is its own der
tense and justification.

“Third in the list is the hedo-
nist, unconsciously so, for he
does not know hedonism is s phi-
losophy. He knows “pleasure and
pain” as the leading motives or
life. He seeks the me and avoids
the other. It is he who gives the
administration occasional trouble
and must be'reprimanded or sent
to another environment.

"The fourth group is the ideal-
ist and crusader. He is the most
forceful of college students. He is
the leader of leagues and protest
movements. l-le embraces the
cause of freedom and justice.

"And lastly, there is the critical
realist. He is the doubter and
skeptic, the eternal usher ot ques-
tions. He has die courage .to dis-
agree, the energy and mental dis-
cipline necessary for practical hf-
fairs."

 

Kent Unsure of ’North Campus Prohlem,’
Asks Whether Hull System Is at Fault

To the Editor:

I tind the whole recent debate conceming the hall system dis-
turbing. it is disturbing because all discussion has been based on
assumptions which have neither been clearly asserted not proved to

be tnle.

The assumptions are (I) that there is a “North Campus problem"

and (2) that it is the result of the present hall system.

I cannot say

that there isn’t a “North Campus problem". Nor can I say that if
there is one it isn’t rooted in the present hnll setup. 1 don’t know and
i don't think anyone else really knows either. Thererore, before pro
posing any more solutions to the “North Campus problem" let us ask
first if such a problem actually exists. Then, if we ﬁnd that_lt does,
let us detinc it clearly Ind publicly and, while we Ire at it, let's also
attempt to define just what both ideally and realistically we wish our

residence system to accomplish,

Personally I have no particular gripes with the

resent hall sys~

tem and think there is much to recommend it. But 1 at is irrelevant.
The residence situation, at best, is only partially related in the real

campus problems of irresponsible

conduct and academic apathy on

the part of a significant portion of the student body. Imaginative sug-
gestions are Certainly in order but let's not conﬁne them to the hall
system which may or may not be ll part ol llrger problems.

The Grudge Pot

The professor glumly crossed ltis legs in the
”English hang,” and his pointed tnot swung regu-
larly like the pendulum of an antique clock.

"Today, class, we discuss . . .." he began, mut-
tering soitly toward the sheaf of papers on his desk.
But the tick cf the clock on the wall, sounding ex<
actly with the monotone of his Voice, made indiS«
tingllishable his words.

As he looked across the desert — the wasteland
of a classroom, gazing on the cactus stumps called
students and hoping fora response — he seemed
to see the tongues of several students ~ perhaps,
all of them - falling from their mouths and drop-
ping cn the desks.

One hay, conspicuously stupid-looking, had an
abnormally large and lazy tongue that dripped
saliva as it lay quivering on in wooden table.

The boy's eyes were swollen and half closed. an
it he knew that he was especially useless to this
class. The boy remained motionless when the pro
fessor asked who was Albee.

“Are you bored, class?” the scholar wondered
out loud.

“Are you just plain bored? It's a crime against
nature to be bored. Please, don't be bored. Be any-
thing but bored."

“l'm a duck," said a young man in the front
row, who happened to overhear. "Quack, quack,

quack." He jumped about the room in a squat posir
tion, his arms flapping like wings; but everyone
else seemed too bored to notice.

"You're not a duck. No one even thinks you're
a duck," said the proiessor, pointing to the passive
classroom as proof.

"Why don’t you shut up and cut the quackin’,"
shunted another student from the hack of the room.
“Let the prof do the talkin’. He knows who's a duck
and who isn't.”

"Yeah," said a tough-looking girl. “I've had dates
with guys like you. if it's not a duck, it's some-
thin’ else."

“You stink, fella," A large athlete said, rising
and pushing down the duckrmimic with a dirty en-
gineer boot. "The phonics are worst of all.”

“We do not seem to be advancing in our les-
sons," interrupted the professor, nervously avoid»
ing the sight of the prostrate youth.

"We don’t need you, either, prof.” said the
athlete, 3nd he smashed the podium with a side
lung kick of his boot, “Why don't you go back to
your room and have a martini land read I book?"

"Good idea!" exclaimed the scholar, hurriedly
departing. “And no class next week. 1 have a con-
ference in Hoboken.”

"Stoke the times while you’re leavin', prof,"
the athlete shouted down the hallway. "It‘s freeiin'
in here. X can almost see your breath!" The clasl
responded with a sharp, short burst of laughter.

It didn’t take the SGA Ad-
visory Council very long Wednes-
day night to decide against mak-
ing monthly contributions to l
Des Moines civil rights project.
The idea of allocating student
funds was alien to most minds,
too big a responsibility for some,
and there was even talk of a
sizable opposition to such action
on the part of the body politic
being represented.

Keeping in mind that this is the
college generation becoming no
torious tor its political and social
conscience, supposedly ready to
take on any toe in its morally
resolute regard for minority
rights, and you have the strange
specter of liberal-arts Grinnell as
a blind island in a sea of student
awareness, an illiberal pocket of
nonsophisticates out in the prov~
inces who haven’t heard yet that
it's 1965. if you don’t want to go
that far, you can simply agree
that student apathy here even
cuts across threads of allegiance
running through the psychologi-
cal cloth of the entire genera-
tldn. SGA people, repmentstivss
for us all, apparently don't give
a lcatological expression Iboul
civil rights. it least not openly.
Paul Thurston was hinting at this
when he puzzled over the idea of
allocating all that money. for

a month to spend on an ironlcal-

The other side of the coin,
though, has it that somebody has
the generation all wrong, and
that political militants among us
are only the freakish party fa-
vors of a middle class society so
strong that it can undenvrite sur-
realist and orgiastic rituals of
seltincrimination at no expense
whenever it becomes either over-
ly bored or overly guilt-ridden,
In this view, disaffectit‘m with
the parent society has produced
a malaise so thorough and pro
found that most people don‘t
even bother with the symbolic
working out of their bitterness
as represented in things like
eccentricities of dress, experi-
mentation w i t h hallucinatory
drugs. or commitment to radical
causes, It simply does no good.
This kind of behavior is, instead.
increasingly restricted to young-
ti- and younger adherents, those
people not yet hip to their own
psychologies. A close examina-
tion of current high school fad!
will bear this out.

Accordingly, it was only the

'conjunction of the Negro's‘ in-

creased political aspirations with
a growing alienation trorn ordi-
nary instltutiona that allows
young radicals the respectability
they newly possess. The (act that

to its inability to relate to ordie

change.

it this is in unusuauy black
portrait, it iii possibly because I
have gotten tired of loaklng at
gray ones for so long. This belies
a certain impatience on my part
with people who don‘t appreciate
the full significance of wide-
: p r e a d boredom. Admittedly,
there is a certain mood afoot in
the civil rights movement that
wants to shift emphasis 1mm
demonstrations to politics. and
there is certainly a strain ot
idealism somewhere along all
those people singing “We Shall
Overcome." There is more ideal-
ism, anyway, in singing tor the
sake of song when you could be
out voting against Des Moines
projects. in a curiously legslls
tic and ostensibly wholesome
way, the son has done its small
part in speaking for us all.

Herman Describes Experiences

Antioch College and University
of California at Berkeley are the
former locations of Eugene l-ler—
man, who now joins Grinnell's
math department.

Herman, with his 13.5. irom Un-
lverstty [if Chicago and his MA.
and PhD. from U.Cr at Berkeley,
spent the summerquatter, 1934,
at Antioch and last year at Bar
keley.

“I did specifically look (or a
small school,” Herman said “I
enjoyed the excitement oi the en
vents (at Berkeley) but the things
which tltey implied about the uni-
versity were not so good.

“They (the events) signihed a

large, impersonal university where
students don't see their prufes
sors; and students and professors
irom ditierent departments don't
have much to say to each other.”
At Grinnell, Herman pointed out
“people get used to seeing their
protessots around. They know they
can see them; whereas Berkeley
is large and most or the professors
discourage student visits. The stu~
dents recognize this and get into
the habit of not seeing them.”
Antioch represents a totally dit»
(erent climate, Herman said.
“Here, when students come in (to
a protessor's otiice) they want to
talk about the subject matter, At

“The way Antioch is Structured,
the school encourages the student
to be involved in more than just
academic activities," he com—
mented. The question seemed to
him to be: “Should a school offer
a student a great number of non-
academic activities and encourage
his participation, or should a
school offer a student an academ-
ic liberal arts education and let
the student seek out for himseli
nonacademic activities if he
wishes?“

Like makeup, costumes ongi
hated in prehistoric times. The
priests dressed in skins and shells,
daubed their faces and bodies With
colored clay and berry juice. The
disguises acted both as vivid rep-
resentations of the gods and as
a protection lor the priests a-
gainst the wrath of the gods, The
Egyptians formalized these cere~
monies into set dramatic rituals
whose traditions the Greeks inher-
ited. when the dramas became
more secular, tho disguises were
carried right along. it was Aeschy—
lus who ﬁrst made the costumes
more individual. The masks were
enlarged and the actor's height
and shape were changed by the
costumes. When Romans took over
the Greek theatre, the only change
they made was to standardize
color as symbolic oi character.

The theatre of the Middle Ages
saw the return oi the religious
drama. Costumes became grotes-
que and visually symbolic. The
devil was clothed in Skins with a
Virgin’s face on a horned animal's
head, Adam and Eve dressed in
white leather to look like skin, and
in animal skins. Less stock char-
acters dressed in the cast—oil
clothes oi the day. The Eliza-
bethans dropped the religious char-
acter of drama. Costumes were
the cast-OHS of the rich and often
complete with jewels. Special
costumes were apportioned for
Oriental or Eastern characters,
Roman and Greek characters, and
characters outside those of the
stock comedy-tragedy iheatricals.

It has been brought to our
attention recently that white
iifesavers — peppermint, spear
mint -— give of! light when
broken. The light is quite faint
but distinctly discernible in a
dark room. One oi the more
advanced methods of observing
this phenomenon is to chew one
in front of a mirror in a dark
[00ml

 

The 18th century saw most actors
still in the dress or the day. It
was in the early 19th century when
costumers finally began to pay
any attention to historical occur-
acy,

Today, the iirst point to be con-
sidered in costuming is the period
oi the play. But this design must
be modiﬁed to fit the character,
his relation to others, the tone oi
the play itseli, and the practical
construction. The costume must be
integrated with other costumes
and the set in color and design.

Helen Klein is costume mistress
this year. She has been sewmg
{or herself for many years. For
our productions, she ieels mood
and color are almost more im-
portant than historical accuracy.
“I draw my own designs aitcr
reading the play and watching re-
hearsals. The actual sewing is not
as hard as the ﬁtting and refitting
necessary to make the costumes
work." Helen does the costumes
for the major productions, assists
un workshops. and is presently rc~
organizing the costume depart-
ment.

Although Helen is a sociology-
anthropology major, she is very
active in theatre, which she en-
joys immenselyr She welcomes.

New Art Exhibition
Features ‘Pop-Op'

"Pop~0p,” an exhibition or is
contemporary paintings asseme
bled by the Leo Castelli Gallery
in New York City, is on display
in Schealier Gallery now until
Oct. 25

The exhibition, which is begin-
ning a series or showings at the
Associated Colleges of the Mid-
west. includes paintings by such
artists as Miles Jensen, Bob Stan-
ley, Jerry Foyster, Mel Ramos,
Ton-i Wesselmann, Elliott Lloyd,
Roy Lichtenstein, and Andy War-
1101.

Pop and op art, the contending
styles among today’s avant-garde
painters, are rooted in the tra-
ditional concerns oi the painter,
according to Robert McMillan
(art).

Pop art, a strange but direct
development from earlier con-
cerns im‘ realism, casts a Curi-
ous, harrcn, uncritical, and objec-
tive eye upon fragments oi Con-
temporary commercial imagery.
Free of intent to please the eye,
it can claim to provoke the mind
to some awareness of the banal
in our time.

01) art, as a style, derives from
a long history of the artist’s cure
iosity toward the mechanics or
vision itself. it utilizes optical
tricks to eontuse the eye and to
surprise the viewer with strange
lifects of line and color, or shape
relationships

The Scheafler Gallery is open
from 7 am, to 11 p.m. Monday
through Saturday and noon to it
p.m. Sundays.

King of the Rocket Men Becomes Fetish of Youth

By ANNE FARRER

Using the term loosely, Grinr
nell's fall social season has gotten
underway and has, or hopes to,
bring an array or diverse events
to supplement the ordinary stimu-
Iating atmosphere or the Grinnell
campus.

La Dulce Vita and Cannonball
Adderly have come and gone with
Homecoming and Dance IM's soon
to make their annual appearance.

However, the highlight to date has
been that classic oi the silver
Screen, King of the Rocket Men.
But Jetf King has a certain
ooompli that Cannonball seemed to
lack#a snappy dresser, battler of
evil (lacilitated by the tact that
his oppressors sport black suits in-

stead of conduct pro slips), utiliz-
ing the latest technical advances,
he is an exemplary hero tor to
days lost youth. Whether they em-

nlale or sublimate through Jeff
King, it seems evident that as an
idol he should be ranked with
such greats as Captain Midnight,
Superman, and Captain Video, or
if not heights as dizzying as this,

at least the Popeye and Spin and
Marty level. A prototype of the
clean living, clean loving Ameri—
can, Jeff King may well go down
in folk history as the male Shlr~
ley Temple.

Eastman Directs Teacher Education;
Says Schooling Must Be Modernized

Directing teacher education at
Grinnell, as Well as offering two
courses in education and plillosor
phy, is now the duty at George
Eastman.

Eastman comes to Grinnell from
the University of Toledo, Ohio,
where he taught in the philosophi-
cal loundstions department or the
College of Education.

Atter receiving a B.A. in Eng-
lish from the University of R0-
Chester, Eastman explored various
fields at post-graduate study, in
cluding doctorate work in English
at Princemn, study at Yale Dlvln-
ity School, the completion or an
MA. in secondary education at
the University of Rochester and of
an Ed.D. at Harvard University.

Eastman has taught English and
speech, on both junior and seninr
levels. In Rochester, N.Y., as well
as general psychology and philoso-
phy at Brockport State Teachers'
College.

Eastman‘s two main interests
are language analysis in its appli-
cations to education, and the “de-
veloping of models and schemas
lor the analysis oi broad human
problems.”

Eastman observed that his po-
sition at Grinnell gives him a schee
dule which will permit involvox
ment in research. He ﬁnds Gl‘ll’h
nell “more exciting and intellect-
ually stimulating” than other
schools where he has taught.

Eastman’s interests have led
him to formulate Certain education-
at ideals. “It is my opinion,” he
says, “that almost all of the high-
er education in the United States
needs to be drastically over-
hauled or revised. It is in almost
all of its Essentials anarchrunislic.
it is an education based upon it
medieval world View with its roots
in Judeo-Christian Culture, What is
needed, I believe, is a system OI
higher education and, by exten-
sion, a system oi public and pi-i.
Vale schuollng, which will be gen-
nninely in phase with the altered
world view of an advanced tech-
nological nationl"

Education today, Eastman goes
on to say, produces ”many people
who are schooled, but only a hand-
ful who are educated” He defines
an educated person as one who
“has so integrated learning that
there is no line of demarcation
between living his lite and learn.

College Costs Cut,

Bill Not at Grinnell ‘

i . By PAUL BRADLEY

The Canadian Union of Students
has Called for a national demon-
stration ta be held October 27 in
which college students throughout
Canada will protest the rising cost
of education. This resolution for
"llie abolition of all social and
linuucial barriers to postssecondv
ary education” was formulated at
the annual meeting at the corigiess
at the Canadian UnIon of Students

The proposed tree tuition would
apply only tn tax-supported uni-
versities, eliminating any linane
cull requirement from the stu-
dent's admission needs. In the
first step to free education, Mem-
orial University at St. John’s,
Newloundland, granted tree tuition
to its 1,400 freshmen. This free
education will also be extended
to Memorial sophomores next

year.
e n r

Believing that the course credit
', and grading system may be a gen-
uine barrier to education» Colora-
do College began this September
a program to provide an upper
(unity for superior students to
work independently through their
tour years of college Twenty-live
freshmen wrll enroll in the pilot
group and will study under the
guidance of faculty preceptors.
They will receive no credits as
such, although any course will be
open as them at any time.

There will be no grades, ai-
though their work will belte-
quently subjected to evaluation
and criticism. Students are ex-
pected to confer often with their
advisers and with others at the

Football Team Travels To Knox;
Fumbles Away Ripon Gam , 27-0

Still searching for a more po-
tent offense, the Pioneer football
team will travel to Galesburg tn-
morruw to take on the winless
SlWaShel‘s at Knox in their third
Midwest Conference game, The
Pioneers are now 1-1 after drop-
ping a 274) contest to Ripon last
Saturday.

The Pioneers got off to a hor-
rible start at Ripon by rumbling
on the second play from scrime
mage. After the Pioneers had
picked up seven yards on the first
play, they gave the ball to Ripon
near the 20. The Pioneer defense
dug in though, and the Redmen
had to settle for a 24-yard field
goal. About live minutes later, Rt
pon intercepted a pass on the Pio-
neer 40 and proceeded to drive in
Tor the score. Ripon also fumbled
once in the drive but recovered it
themselves. The final eight yards
was covered on a pass to give the
Redmen a 10-0 lead alter the first
quarter.

The next time the Pioneers got
moving, they were thwarted by an
interception again. A pass was
good to the Pioneer receiver, but
it slipped through his ﬁngers and
Ripon picked it up. The Redmen
then wasted no time in scoring
again, Quarterback Dick Kuehl
lofted the ball to Bob Pelllgrino
who juggled the ball for about
three steps, then outrun the Pio-
neer secondary for the doryard
touchdown.

Late in the second quarter the
Pioneers had their best chance to

 

get on the scoreboard wllen John
Lawson creamed the Ripon quar-
terback, who fumbled, and the
ball was recovered on the six
yard line. The Pioneers were then
pushed back to the 12 where they
again gave up the ball. A pass
was again picked off by Ripon af»
ter the ball had slipped through
Grinnell’s hands.

Near the end of the third quar—
ter the Redmen picked off another
Pioneer pass and returned it to
the five yard line, But the de—
fense held and Ripon kicked a-
nother field goal, In the fourth
quarter the Redmen picked anoth-
er Pioneer fumble on the Grinnell
25 and in two plays went in for the
final score Late in the fourth
quarter the Pioneers had their on-
ly sustained drive of the game
which took them to the Ripon five
where they proceeded to lose it on
another interception.

Coach Bowers thought the Flu
near defensive line and line back»
ers did a good job. Also the Pio-
neer backfield allowed Ripon to
complete only seven of 27 passes,
but unfortunately three of them
were touchdowns. Bowers also
noted that the game would have
been very boring to the impartial
spectator as the game consisted
of only punts and an occasional
Pioneer mistake late in thEir ter-
ritory. Bowers noted that Ripon
never got a long drive together for
a score but were always given the
ball very near the goal before
they scored,

 

To improve the offense, Bowers
said Grinnell must have better
qual'terbacking, blocking, and run-
ning from the halfbacks. In an
effort to beef up the offense this
week, Bowers plans much expere
imenting. Sophomores Kent Thom-
son and Rich Weeks will be given
a shot at the quarterback spot.
John Shierholz will remain at the
halfback spot With Dick Lamb.
Bob Watt, Dave Synhorst, and
Jim Ceai-nal in the running for
the other one, AI Peterson will
remain at one slot, but the other
will be contested for by Jim Pol-
son, Jeff Franiz, and Tom Hill,

On defense, guard Erick Vail
and back John Kelsey will likely
miss the Knox game with Injur-
Iesi Rick Anderson and John Pitt-
man have also been ailing but are
expected to play

Knox, which dropped its first
two games to Ripon 3&7, and Be-
loit, 41-7, currently stands ninth
in the league on offense and last
on defense.

The freshman grid team Will
open its schedule by meeting the
Cornell yearlings Friday at Mt.
Vernon,

Probable starters, according to
Coach John Pfitsch, are Brian
Barnes and Dave Luthy, ends;
Bob Campell and Bob Lillis, tack~
les; AI Cloud and Grant Crandall,
guards; Randy Stare, center; Tom
Lower, quarterback; Pat Cava-
naugh and Don Kraitsik, half-
backs: and Roger Bryant, full-
back.

 

Friday, October a. ms

that

By STEVE CASEY

The Pioneers this year have lost soccer, 3 sport which
was considered by many people, including me, to be one of
the most exciting sports of the whole year. It was especially
exciting since Coach Irv Simone was able to build strong
teams that gave stiff challenges to such small college powers
as Wheaton and Lake Forest. Unfortunately Simone is on
leave this semester, so the sport was dropped as an official
college sport. A few of the veterans from last year’s team
have formed a soccer club, under the direction of Dirk Baay
(German), This is a good idea but it will never replace the
regular teams for excitement because it was sometimes as
much fun to watch Simone as the game.

Anyway, when Simone returns, let’s hope the sport will
be resumed. The thrill of seeing the Pioneers score a goal
or seeing someone like little Fred Miller battle for the ball
among people that look twice as big as he is something which
Grinnell sports fans, especially ones who have never seen a
soccer game in person, should see. For this particular excite-
ment can never be matched by seeing a touchdown scored or
a runner finish first in a cross-country race.

The crosscountry team was disappointed in not winning
the Les Duke invitational. But this is a good team and it would
be wrong to think otherwise, The barriers have two first-class
runners in Jeri Langham and John Sharpe. There are also
five other good runners: Steve Brintnall, Doug Dray, Bob
Grant, Ric MacDowell, and Spencer Clark.

A person who should know, the Carleton coach whose
team is seeking its fourth straight league title, considers the
Pioneers a co»favorite along with his team to take the crown
this year. Unfortunately, Carleton has got tremendous help
from sophomores who are new four of the top five runners
on the team.

There are at least three more tough teams (Beloit, St.
Olaf, and Cornell) in the Midwest Conference this year. But
the Pioneers soundly defeated both Cornell and Beloit in
the Les Duke invitational. So it is not unlikely that Coach
Young’s team will finish near the top as they usually do.
