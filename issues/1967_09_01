HACKES, l48,
TO SPEAK,
GET DEGREE

Peter Hackes, a 1948 Grinnell
College graduate who is an
NBC News space specialist,
will address a convocation
which wlll highlight the open-
ing of the college’s 122ml yeart

in addition to speaking, he
Will be awarded an honorary
L.H.Dt (doctor (ll humane let-
tel's) degree at the convocation,
whlch is scheduled for 8 pm.
Monday, Sept, 4, in Darby
Gymnasium.

A veteran of America’s space
program who covered early
launches with field glasses from
the beach just outside of Cape
Kennedy, the 43-year—old Hacked
has seen teIeVlslon’s space cov-
erage grow to a level of so-
phistication that includes the
use of true-to-lite models and
moclcups,

He has reported every man-
ned space flight, and during
recent nights his assignment
has been to simulate the Var-
ious tasks periormed by the
astronauts in outer space. By
using space models, he demon»
stl‘ales how the mission is car-
ried out.

On general assignment in
Washington, DC, Hackes con~
centrales on reporting the ac-
tivities of the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administra-
tion. the National Aeronautics
and Space Council, and the
Senate and House Space Com-
niittecs. His assignments also
include the Department or Do-
fense (where he was NBC
News Pentagon correspondent
for 10 years), the Atomic En-
ergy Commission, the Federal
Aviation Agency, the Departe
ment of Transportation, and
other areas or the federal govA
erlinicnt.

A native of New York City,
Hackes attended Grilillell Col~
logo in 1942-43 and alter three
years ill the Navy returned to
Cvl‘lllllell and received a B.A.
degree in English (journalism)
in 1948.

Willie at Grinnell, Hackes
was a member of the campus
newspaper, radio station, lit~
erary magazine, and humor
magazine stalls, and or the
cllmr anti glee club. He was
elected to membership in Sigma
Delta Chi and Friars.

thanks to the new locks. they
may safely exit from the loggla

that at the same time they are

From The President

Dear Studentsl

it is good to have you here. The place isn't the same without
you. As one ot my presidential colleagues, l-larold Stoke, once ro-
marked,

A campus is dead when its students are not there; it hums
when they are. Not only are the students themselves galvanic
but they galvanize everyone else 7 faculty, deans, presidents,
and campus police. The annual return of the students inspires
in everyone connected with a college the mixed ieelings or
a happy homecoming and the wariness or people who are come
pelled to live in occupied territory.

I wish he had Said II more cheerfully, but he had been at the
job longer than 1, and the important thing is his accuracy. which
Is unquestioned. The purpose or a college, to paraphrase Alfred
North Whitehead, is to unite the old and the young in the imagin-
ative search (or knowledge; but wtthout students to seek. to re-
spond, and to question, a college is nothing, only a group or
separated adults searching for something to commit their learning
and their ‘iopes to.

Grinnell is not this, For 122 years it has been concerned with
the way its students and iaculiy and its academic environment
interact with one another [0 provlde an intellectual and social com«
munity or style and strength and purpose. It is, as I wrote you
newly entering students some time ago, and as you returning
students know, neither pertectly free nor periectly ordered. it has
some or the uninspiring and contusing aspects or real lite in gem
eral, and a good deal of the dull and frustrating characteristics
ol the scholar’s life In particular. It requires from all of us pa-
tience, hard work, and a disciplined way oi talking and writing and

behaving.

But Grinllell will give us much in return: new friends, the
satisfaction ol accomplishing things intellectually that we thought
were beyond us, the sense or our own litness to belong in an iii-
tellectual community. Above all, it wlll give us the opportunity to
educate our imaginations so that we can manage better than we
do now both the strange and exciting world inside us and the
puzzling and sometimes terrible yet remarkable world utilSlde.
The cultivation 0i this inside and outside imagination is What. edtb
cation in the liberal arts means, and What finally, Grlnnell is all
about. i hope you see it this way too. Welcome and welcome back,
and my best Wishes ioi a successtul year,

Glenn Leggett
President

A Student

Newspaper

Scarlet & Black is the student newspaper of Grinnell
College. It is written to be read by Grinnell students, and
all others who read it must bear this in mind.

Feature topics and editorial positions may not meet
with the reader’s approval, but the responsibility of the
paper will not be questioned. Scarlet {it Black intends to
be bound by relevancy, taste, credibility and law, but by
nothing else. A good paper must have inner discipline
rather than an imposed outer harness. Scarlet & Black
may cause anger or pleasure, but it will be consistent in
its awareness of its responsmility to provide Grinnell stu-
dents with accurate and relevant news and comment.

Women's Hours

The elimination of women’s hours was long awaited,
and is a welcome liberalization of college rules. In rec-
ognition of this signal occasion, discussion of Grinnell’s
remaining social problems will be suspended until next

week.

 

There will he ii short meeting tor new and returning stu-
dents interested in working tor the 5&3 in any capacity.
The meeting will be held Sunday at 2:15 p.m. in the 5&3

5 (north end oi the Forum basement).

GRAY MATTER

It is Fall once again and time
tor the Grinneii campus to
plunge into the alirencompds-

sing world at LM. sports. Tile
Intensity with which they are
played, the bitter personal an-
tagonisms which are built up,
the crushing physical contact,
the halting of officials and the
poetry in motion are all part or
the Grinnell sports scene. 0i
course, not everyone takes it
as seriously as the girls
(chuckle). There is nothing like
an I.M. program to provide
hall spirit, so for the rookies
in camp and tor the beneiit
of tile returning veterans, a
briei recap or last year's ac-
tivities is in order.

The year began with Dibble
Winning tootball, ﬁnishing 9-1.

By BILL GRAY

Gates was a surprise second
at 3-2. In tennis, which was
run concurrently, North won

easily as is theii ciistom. Smith
splashed to a it point victory
over Smith in swimming. This
appeared to be the least pollu-
lar ot the sports, as only six
of eleven halls entered. Norlh
then took their second trophy
oi the year by capturing vol-
leyball, Smilli look the ﬁrst of
their many trophies as they
captured the badminton title.
Dibble became the First hall [0

easily won basketball taking 19
or 20 games. Clark was second
at 1574. Dick Lovell led the

i-ick Te Paske topped the its"

bet-tsoit took the championship.
Smith won howling tor the
third year in a row while Dibble
finished second (or the third
year in a row. Steve Hunt. had
both high game and high Sei‘<
ies. To ﬁnish the year, East
came on strong to take the
track meet, featuring three
lirsis by Mike Schwartz, and
capture soitball with a 9-1
mark. Smith won goll to end
competition. Smith won the
Ti'uesdale and MacMurray tl‘o~
pllies which are presented to
the hall compiling the most
points in all the I.M. sports.
Dibble finished second, Not‘lh
third and East lourth. Coupled
itith the action emanating [mm
the iemtnine set, the LM. year
was most exciting and di-
verting. But putting the past
behind (which is a good place
tor it) I take pen in hand to
make some rash and totally
untounded predictions lor the
football season.

Counting down an opponent’s original suit distribution is one

Against this slam contract, west led the deuce of Hearts. which
was won by East’s ace. Deciarer won the next trick with the Eco
or Diamonds when East returned the king. Apparently the succesi
oi the contract depended upon the successful linesse against the
queen of Clubs, which could be laken either way. Locating the
queen oi Clubs. then, is the key to the contract. and counting
down the hands is the key to locating the Club queen.

At this point, declarer had a periect count on East’s hand,
Since West was void of ttumps, East must have started with
three. The play or the Diamond suit revealed that each opponent

East had live Hearts (by inference), three Spades and (our
