A precision acrobatic pilot is
one of Grinnell’s featured inter»
lm lecturers.

Nor-wood Russell Hanson is
lecturing not on aerial acrobat-
ics but on Newtonian physics. A
noted authority on the history
and philosophy of science, Han-
son flies for recreation and
transportation.

“As a boy I lived near an air-
port which is probably where I
first became crazy about air-

lanes. I made model planes
out of balsa, too. In 1934 I saw
a demonstration by Al Williams,
one of the best acrobatic pilots
the United States Navy ever
produced; and ever since then
'wanted to fly myself," said
Hanson,

During World War II Hanson
became a Marine Corps flyer
garner based) and was first

eserve Pilot on the first team
of the Blue Angels.

Hanson now owns his own
plane, a F8F<Z Grumman
Bearcat. This was a 1949 na-
val fighter which until 1955
held the world’s record for
climbing — almost 11,000 feet
a minute. In the February is-
sue of FLYING, Hanson has
an article entitled “The Last
of the Red Hot Cats" which
describes the plane and some
of his adventures with it.

During the war Hanson was
also a boxer. In 1942 he won the
Marine Corps Officer’s light
heavyweight championship. He
also was in the Golden Gloves
competition, advancing to the
semifinals in the heavyweight
division. Altogether he had 22
amateur matches, losing only
once in this time. His last fight
was in I952 when he boxed
Gwyn Williams. light heavy-
weight champion of Wales.

Hanson is also a motorcycle
enthusiast.

He said, “1 have a Harley-
Davidson cycle now which I
have souped up. I have done
up to 123 miles an hour on
it; it will do 143, I think. This
cycle is my twelfth. I started
in 1939 and used to race on
sandlots. We wore one iron
shoe which we would put down

“People think that their de-
scription of an event is an ac-
count purely of what is there,"
rem'arked visiting lecturer Ken-
neth Burke. "Actually a tre<
mendons amount of the de-
scription is merely carrying out
the implication of terms.”

Burke, a noted literary crit-
ic, contends that the nature of
terminology determines the na-
ture of observation; that "cer-
tain terms will lead you one
way, other terms will lead an-
other way."

.The deterministic feature of
language was a theme of his
Prologue in Heaven which had
its premiere Sunday evening at
Grinnell.

“This was not written to be
performed,’ confessed Burke.
“It was more an imitation of
a Platonic dialogue, made to
be read with the eye. The dia-
logue is enough on the edges
of drama to be performed,
but in a dialogue the purpose
is to get the sentences said»
to explain a theory. In a dra-
ma the sentences further the
action.”

Burke continued, “It was
acted charmingly. The whole
company did a fine job. Watch-
ing it was rather amusing for
me since I’m used to lecturing,

in which you’re responsible for
everything. That time 1. could
sit back and let others take on
the main responsibility.”

Besides creating his own dra-
ma — dialogue, stories, and
poems, Burke has translated
works of other authors, notably
Thomas Mann All Mann‘s let-
ters to the literary magazine
Dial were translated by Burke
and the first English transla-
tion of Mann’s “Death in Ven-
ice" was Burke's handiwork.

He reCalled, “I had done a
translation of “Deabh in Venice”
for myself, just because i
loved it, and had put it away.
At that time I was affiliated
with Dial magazine, and the
editor cabled from Europe that
they had secured rights to
translate Mann’s "Death in
Venice" into English. As soon
as I saw that, I told the staff
that I could bring in a trans»
lation the next day!”

Burke had always had a

Debate Question

In Women'slniegraiion Movement

Marie Martin, aws Board
president, urges all women to
consider the desirability of
integrated dormitories on the
basis of what is the best resi-
dential situation for freshman
and for upperclass women re-
spectively within the physical
limitations of the living quar-
ters.

In preparation for future ref~
erendum on the issue, women of
the Quad discussed the issue
Monday afternoon in M ain
Lounge. A panel of upperclass
women started the discussion
with brief statements of opin-
ion.

After these opening comments

Japanese Professor
To Teach Sociology
During Spring Stay

A J sip a n o s e sociologist.
Hidetoslli Kata, will be the
third Asian-nation scholar to
serve as a visiting professor
on campus this year when he
joins the college’s faculty for
the second semester.

A graduate of Hitosubashi
University in Tokyo, 1952, Kato
will be teaching courses in soc-
iology and history.

Professor Kato has been a r
search associate at Kyoto Uni-
versity, n visiting scholar at
Stanford University, and a VIS-
itingprofessor at Doshisha Un-
iversity.

The author of numerous
books and articles in English
and Japanese, Kato has also
studied at Harvard University
and the University of Chi-
cage,

Professor Kato and his wife,
Takoe, will live with their two
children, Mari, 5, and Fumit—
oshi, 2, in the home of Dr. Dirk
Baby. The Baays will be spend-
ing the Coming year in Africa,
where Dr. Baay (German) will
be a Fulbright-Hayes visiting
professor at Cuttington College,
Succoco, Liberia.

This week’s Scarlet and

of Frosh Dorms

the discussion was opened to
the whole group.

It w a s mentioned that
freshmen are impressionable,
and that “hall spirit" seems
to s p r e a d contagionsly
throughout a freshman dorm.
While their enthusiasm often
leads to constructive projects,
freshmen sometimes may in-
fluence each other not; to
study. The “stabilizing influ-
ence” of upperclass women
might be beneficial for fresh-
men, -

Some upperclass girls felt
freshman exuberance might
benefit the unintegrated halls,
Others, however, were afraid
freshmen might tend to be ex-
cessively noisy.

In Cleveland and James, the
halls currently integrated, there
is a maximum of six freshmen
on a floor, and these girls some-
times seem to be cut off from
other members of their class.
With total integration of wom-
en's halls the needs for an im-
mediate friendship group and
for individual privacy might
both be met.

The physical problem was im-
portant to upperclass girls too.
They felt it unfair that fresh-
men might be placed in desir-
able rooms such as the connect-
ing singles in Read, while two
seniors might have to share one
of the tiny doubles in Main.

Marie suggested that the
women first consider whether
integrated dorms would better
serve their academic, social
and emotional needs, and if
t h e y decide affirmatively,
then discuss the physical lim-
itations on the integrated SyS‘
tem.

Hoping to stimulate further
discussion on integrated dorms,
Marie distributed a brief state-
ment of the major problems to
be considered.

General Dwight D. Eisenhow-
er wrll be the political lecturer
for the Program in Practical
Political Education next year.
C. Edwin Gilmour, program die
rector, announced this week.

Although definite plans have
not been made, Gilmour has
received word that the former
president will come to Grin-
nell someiime in May 1965.
He will spend two days on
campus as Politician-in-Resi-
dence, and will deliver the an-
nual Political Lectureship, He
will be accompanied on his
trip by his wife, Mamie.

As with former PPPE lec~
turers, Eisenhower will be in
direct contact with students on
both an informal and formal
basisi Plans will include lunch-
eon and dinner meetings with'
students, classroom visits, and.
probably a press conference.
Special plans will also be made
for Mrs. Eisenhower to meat
With students.

The PPPE program. usually
held in the fall, Will be post<
poned until spring next year so
that the Eisenhowers can at-
tend. Gilmour told the 5&3
Wednesday that original plans
had called for the former presi-
dent to be on campus in Octo<
ber, but during an exchange of
letters Eisenhower said he
could not give a definite date
until this summer.

Due to the extensive plan-
ning needed for the program
and the importance of its
guest lecturer, it was decided
that the date wo uld be
changed to sometime in the
spring; Eisenhower then an-
swered that he and his wife
would be leaving California
sometime in mid-May and
that they would stop at Grin-
nell on their way to their
summer home in Gettysburg.

Included in the plans for the
Eisenhower visit is the endow-

ment of an annual Eisenhower
Political Award, employed with
the approval of the former
president. The award would be
presented at Commencement to
the graduating senior who has
best exemplified the ideals and
objectives of the PPPE during
his stay at crinnell. ,

Editorial “Zip" Code

In attempting to ire-evaluate the “letters to the
editor” department and establish a norm for letter
publication in the year to come, two things require
primary consideration. First, such a department is of
very little value unless it is a weekly presentation of
quality contributions, Second, the problem of keep-
ing the department going demands responsibility on
the part of both the S&B and its readers.

The problem of keeping a steady stream of letters
ﬂowing into the editor’s office is contingent both upon
reader interest in campus issues and the journalistic
integrity of the editor with regard to all letters sub-
mitted.

In 1964 it will be our practice to print those letters
which the college situation deems relevant or of in—
terest. We will not allow prejudice or personal opinion
to color our choice of letters for this department. The
“letters to the editor" column should exist as one of
reader opinion, and not of editorial opinion.

It seems especially important to stress the fact
that a prerequisite for publication in the “letters” col-
umn doesn’t necessarily mean that a letter must criti-
cize or complain. Letters of praise for some event or
person, letters of agreement on some issue, or letters
of evaluation concerning some campus discussion are
just as much a part of any good ”letters" department
as are letters of criticism.

Although it is impossible at times to print every
letter submitted to the S&B, each letter submitted
will either be printed or acknowledged by a personal
letter from the editor explaining why it was not used.

The ”letters to the editor” department is open,
then, to you our readers Last week we stated that it
would exist as an open forum for opinion, discussion,
and debate. We have stated here that every effort will
be made on this side of the editor’s desk to maintain a
readers’ opinion department of quantity and quality.
The rest is up to you,

Goldwater Favored to Take
Mock Convention Nomination

 

0n the strength of the results
of a poll published by the Young
Republican newsletter, the YR
Pioneer, Senator Barry Gold-
water is the pre-convention fa-
vorite to win the Republican
nomination for president in the
upcoming Mock Political Con-
vention. In the poll Goldwater
was the choice of 46 per cent
of the 97 Young Republicans
who responded to the poll. His

. closest rival, Governor Nelson
' Rockefeller, was the choice of
only 13 per cent who responded.
However, much has changed
since the death of President
Kennedy, and preliminary re-
ports on the latest YR Pioneer
poll indicate that Goldwater
‘may have lost strength on the
‘Grinnell campus. The results
of the poll are to be released
In February.

Dave Evans, President of die
iYoung Democrats club, says
that a group in his club has or»
ganized and is planning a cam-

 

paign to secure the Democratic
vice-presidential nomination for
Wyoming Senator Gale McGee.
it was announced last week in
the 5&3 that Senator McGee
would keynote the Democratic
session.

Bob Savage, President of the
Young Republicans, says he ex-
pects a similar movement to
arise in his club pushing the
nomination of Mark Hatfield for
the second spot on the GOP
ticket. Hatfield is in his second
term as Governor of Oregon, He
will keynote the opening session
of the convention on April 9 and
act as presiding officer for that
session.

Interest in the Republican
convention w as stimulated
this week by speculation as to
whether a group would back
the candidacy of Margaret
Chase Smith. The Maine Sen-
ator announced her intention
to enter the New Hampshire
and Illinois primaries this
week.

Miscellany and Digression

An undergraduate is expect-
ed to be idealistic, and a. senior
is expected to be cynical, Not
wishing to destroy these stere-
otypes today’s column will deal
With that wonderful world of
make believe, the interim ses—
sion.

Theoretically for fresh-
men and sophomores the inc
terim session is a time for in-
dependent study. However,
if we naively believe the defh
nition of the word independ-
ent that appears in the dic-
tionary, l. e. free from con-
trol or persuasion, we see
that than is a contradiction
between theory and practice
in the interim session.

For if a freshman or a sopho—
more were to utilize this time
for true independent reading
and study, he very probably
would not choose the course of
study which the college out-
lines for the interim session.

Freddie Freshman, (it is ala
ways good writing technique to
toss in a name here and there
to give the reader something to
identify With,) is requested, l.
e., told, to independently read
the Aeneid, Both freshmen and
sophomores are encouraged to
independently do reading from
a bibliography supplied by the
school to prepare themselves
for the lectures of Messrs. Hoff-
mann, Hanson and Burke,
which they are urged to inde»
pendently attend.

Now I wish to cast no asper—
sions on these gentleman who
undoubtedly are well qualified
in their ﬁelds and will give ex-
cellent lectures which will bene-
ﬁt all who attend.

For those students who have
been waiting all semester for
a respite from courses to do in
dependent study on "Actio In
Distans: Gravitation for New4
tonians and Post Newtonians,”
the program outlined by the
college is a godsend

It is also probably wel-
comed by those students who
have not developed ally in-
dividual curiosities or inter-
ests and are relieved that the
college has prepared a pro-
gram for the period between
semesters which will enter

tain them or at least keep
them ocCupied so they do not
die of boredom. As it stands
now the student feels that if
he is going to do anything he
might as well follow the pro-
gram set up by the college.
Few do.

We must not forget the up-
perclassmen in this biased anal—
ysis of the interim session. The
juniors are involved in prepar-
ation for the Junior Liberal
Arts examination — Grinnel!‘s
unique device to rid itself of a
vast overstock of paper, ensure
that the post office and service
bureau are constantly function-
ing, and provide, “a means of
evaluation other than the usual
course grades and grade point
average.”

Already the JLA, as it is af—
fectionately known, has cov-
ered the nature of man and the
areas of evidence and evalua-
tion. This year the junior class
will write definitive essays on
order. One topic reportedly
ready for a future year is the
nature of the JLA.

For Seniors, the interim ses-
sion is analogous to the peri-
od between the sentence and
the execution. Literature ma-
jons had the good luck to
have the privilege of taking
part of their comps two days
after ﬁnals. They were able
to avoid some of the torture of
waiting.

History majors are fortun-
ate in that to do well in the
essay portion of their comps
no prior knowledge of his-
tory is required. They are
given a semester of reading
’to do during the interim on
which the essay examination

will be based. Any student
with a proficiency in speed

I o a d l n g, a photographic

mind, and a gift of eloquence

should be able to do well on
the history essay.

What can be done wlth the
interim session? Why not set
up a program whereby stu-
dents are required to present a
plan for independent study dur-
ing the interim to their advise
or? This program could include
reading or the working on a
project. Part or all of the work
could be required in a field sep-
arate from the student’s major.

Pioneers

By Peter Kolln-ian

Grinnell’s basketball team
was upset by Monmouth here
last Saturday, 83-79. The Scots,
whose 2-5 record was in con-
trast to the Pioneers’ 8-2, led ‘
50-39 at the half. The upset was
all the more unusual because it
occurred on Grinnell’s floor in
a conference where a home

loss by one of the title contend:
ers is almost unheard of.

The Scots, who hit 14 of their
first 17 shots from the field,
jumped off to a lead they never
relinquished. They cooled off
slightly after that but were
shooting at a 55% clip when

CARLET AND BLACK

With hopes of brightening
slightly dimmed title chances,
Grinnell’s basketball team will
try to get back on the winning
track Saturday night when it
plays host to (Joe at 7l30 in
Darby Gym.

After last weekend‘s upset
loss to Monmouth, the Pioneers
are now in third place in the
Midwest Conference with a 3-2
mark, two games back of lead-
ing Ripon. Coe, coming on
strong of late with tremendous
scoring power, is 3-5 in league
play.

Shooting has been the main
order of business for the Pio-

Lose to Scots; To Face Kohawks

week, after hitting only 31 per
cent of 106 shots in tho Mon-
mouth loss.

“We just have to start
shooting better, that is all,”
Pi‘itsch says. “We still have
a lot of spirit—after all, we
came back from 17 points
down midway through the
second half. With a couple
breaks, we could have won.”
Pfitsch plans no lineup

changes for this one against
Coe, the 94th meeting between
the two schools. However, it il
a foregone conclusion that Tom
Buchholtz will see more action
after his fine relief effort Sat-

they went to the dressing room
at halftime.

The Pioneers, definitely mis-
sing their best shooter and lead-
ing scorer Gordon Kinkead,
who was declared academically
ineligible the previous week,
were exceptionally cold from
the field, hitting only 29% of
their shots. The fact that the
half-time score was as close as
it was was due largely to the
board work of center John Sun-
dell, who hauled in 12 rebounds
in the first 20 minutes of play,

When the second half started,
the Scots took over where mey
had left off, upping their mar-
gin to 17 points, 77-60, with if!
minutes to play. During this
time, the Scots shot ”only”
45%, but did a much better job
on their defensive board, prer
venting the still—cold Pioneers
from getting more than one or
two shots at a time,

Grinnell dominated the final
13 minutes of play and in the
process cut the Monmouth mar
gin to its final 4 points. In the
minute and a half after the
Seots had amassed their largest
margin, the Pioneers cut it
down to ll points. Monmouth
then went into a semiestall,
waiting for a high-percentage
shot and taking it, This kept
their lead around 10 points until
about 5 minutes remained.

Then, Grinnell led by the
shooting of Buchholtz, nar»
rowed the margin and came
within 3 points of catching the
Scots.

Leading the Pioneer stor-
ing were co-captains Jim Miff-
lin‘ and John Sundell with 10
and 18 points, respectively. Slin-
dell also hauled in 25 rebounds

83-79.

Freshmen Lose lo Monmouth

By Don Kurasch

Grinnell's freshman basket-
ball squad suffered a 79-75 set-
back at the hands of a Wellvbalr
anced Monmouth team. The
lead in last Saturday’s game
changed places so many times,
it seemed the win would go to
whomever happened to be
ahead when time ran out.

What would have been a two-
point lead at halftime became
a 3949 tie when Monmouth’s
Bob Pogue connected with only
three seconds left Pogue, a
6'5” center and forward, domi-
nated the rebounding for most
of the game.

A standout performance
was given by Grinnell guard

Elliot Hibbs, whose record

setting 34 points accpunted
for nearly half the frosh total.
The only other Grinnellian to
score with double figures was
Tom Hill, who connected for
16.

High scorer for Monmouth
was Don Carlson, who racked
up 21 points. Monmouth‘s better
balance was evident in the
scoring column, with a total of
[our players hitting in double
figures. Pogue scored 12; Bob
Ellis and‘.,Dennis Rusk scored
19 and ”respectively

The loss was the second in
three starts for the yearlings.
Tomorrow night the team will
try to even out their win-loss
record when they meet Coe at

During the war Hanson also
became intrigued with physics.
He read a lot and found it ex-
citing. After the war he went on
to Columbia and Tinaily ended
up at Oxford and Cambridge.
He taught at Indiana Univer-
sity, where he founded their de-
partment of the History and
Logic of Science, before going
to his present post at Yale Uni-
,versity.

“My concern has been with
the logical foundations of quan-
tum mechanics. I also have
been following theoretical mi-
crophysics with a good deal of
interest,” he explained.

Right now Hanson is finish
ing his book, Explanation in the
History of Planetary Theory,
and is working on threeother
books, A History of Aerody-
namic Theory; Notes Towards
5 Logic of Discovery, which is
a follow-up on his book, Pat-
terns oi Discovery, and con-
Cairns his interest in the philo-
sophical foundations of science;
and Thirteen Dialogues on Ne-
cessity, which is a book on
straight logic and analysis
written by the revision of some
of his published articles. Ham
son also does lecturing both at
Yale and at other colleges.

Hanson noted, “Lectures
help me to get my ideas
straight. There is a challenge
in preparing and delivering

ideas on a topic. It is rather
similar to the child who said,

‘Mommy, how can I know

what I think until i've said
it.‘ ”

The student might also be

. required to report on his pro»

ject to his advisor upon its com-

pletion. Preferably this report

should be oral. This presup-

poses a liberally educated
faculty.

The JLA is a good idea, but
an attempt should be made
to make the preparation and
the test more meaningful for
the student instead of just an
academic exercise. In this re-
spect, perhaps more emphas-
is on contemporary concepts
and ideas in the various
areas of learning would stim-
ulate interest.

Comps. should be over ideas,
concepts and tools used in pre-

published —— and once Subbed
for the stenographic help
when they were away. It was
this way that Burke got into
musical criticism.

He became music critic of
Dial “by accident.” The regu-
lar critic left and Burke took
his place for a month until a
new Critic could be found. The
selection of a replacement was
continuously delayed and,
“first thing I knew i was music

that respect, but it can give us
hints about meaning," he cau-

Burke was an Esperantist
