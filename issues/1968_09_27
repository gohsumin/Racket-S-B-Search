é MILLION PE CONTRACT AWARDED
WALLACE AD STIRS DEBATE

The Scarlet and Black this week was faced
with a major policy decision when The National
Educational Advertising Service sent an ad for
George Wallace’s presidential campaign. There was

considerable turmoil among the
editorial staff on whether to
print the ad or send it back

eavertising Service handles all of

the advertisement by the cam-

us if it were to be published.

he no for Wallace was the
only political ad received by

a business manager's office.

he business staff of the paper
advocated its publication for fi<
llancial reasons and because it
bias the best policy to accept all
advertisements

The editorial staff argued
that the problem was not clean
out, that there were people on
campus who would be seriously
offended by the ad, and that
their sensitivities ought to be
respected. However, there were
Questions of the responsibility of
the newspaper to allow free-
dom of the press, and whether
the suppression oi the adver-
tisement might be a form of
political censorship.

The editor decided it would
be best to seek advice on the
issue. Mr. Prescott, the Ed-
visor to the paper, Mr. Bow-
man. the Chairman of the Com-
mittee on Publications, and the
Concerned Black Students
(CBS) were all consulted on
the possible repercussions and
advisability oi publishing the
Wallace ad,

CBS said that they would be
satisfied if ads for all the ma-
jor candidates would be puh<

Lambie said that the book-

not to make money, why then

on Sept. 12. Elected as Presi-
dent woa Emest T. Weston.
Chairman of its four committees
—Admisslon, Placement, Fi-
nance. and Public Relations—
were Debby Green, Merryll Pen-
son, Frank Thomas, and Greg-

College population is black, and
the black students of Grinnell,
estimated in number as approx~
imately 43. constitute no more
than 4.6 per cent of the Grinnell
College population. CBS offers
the iollowmg o proposals in
order to remedy this situation
at Grinnell:

The first of the nine points
is the extension of the LeMoyns
College Exchange Program
from one semester to a full
year. for both students and pro-
fessors. Weston feels that the
present one semester program
is “just tokenism," since this
does not give the student time
to adjust to Grinnel] socially or
academically. Since. by tradi-
tion, only four LeMoyne stu-
dents attend Grinncll. wllich has

building which will house the
physical education facilities of
both men and women.

Construction of the complex
is scheduled to begin next
week. If the construction were
not to have started before 0cto<
her 23. the federal grant which
is providing a large part oi the
funds for the project would
have been withdrawn. The
building is scheduled to be
completed in June, 1970.

The PE Complex is being fl-
nanced by an $340,000 loan, a
$30,000 Higher Education Fa-
cilities Commission grant, and
a loan and grant of $380,000
which has been applied for. The
college will raise another
$14,000 on its own

The 2.1 million dollar build-
ing will be the most expensive
one ever constructed by the
college. It will contain a cruci-
iorrn swimming pool (50 meters
in one direction and so yards
in another), much more class:
room space than is provided in
Darby Gymnasium, and a large
Tartan-surlaced area for sports
like basketball, tennis, and
track.

The present physical educa-
tion facilities do not allow for
the teaching or more than one
sport at a time in the gym
during the winter months, and
this often causes conflicts in
scheduling as well as inade-
quate training for athletes in
spring sports.

The new PE Complex will
downgrade the present empha-
sis on team sports, which are
now highly ranked on account
of the difficulties of accommo-
dation in the limited space
available.

According to John Pfitsch
(Physical Education), the com-
plex “can accommodate an em
rollment of at least 2,000.” The

lists the years of all students
of the college.

“1 instruct my officers to
check in the bars every night.
Sometimes things come up, and
they don’t make it,” said
Peters.

if a minor has no identifica-
tion card, the store can he pe-
nalized for servmg him alco-
holic beverages. H the student
has a false identification card,
the store is not liable for pun-
ishment. Last year one store
lost its license for selling beer
to minors.

“Judge Soft”

"The justice of the peace may
be getting soft," said Peters.
He was explaining that the
iines for possession of beer
were always $100, but that now
the lines were often only 525.

“Making beer available to a
minor would be tougher. You’re
stepping up in the leagues
then." Any adult giving beer to
anyone under 21, or even any-
one just over 18 giving beer to
another minor would be subject
to a fine of no less than $300.
but no more than $1000 or 3
months to a year in jail. The
crime is classified as an in-
dictable misdemeanor.

“College students are doing
this all the time. I know it.”
The chiei of police elaborated,
saying that it he could get e .
dence of this he would not he -
tate at all in bringing charges
against any college student
bringing liquor oi any kind to
E friend.

When asked how he knew
that college students were
traiiicking in beer, he said,
"We have ways.” He would not
elaborate.

“Last yeari called in 15 or
20 college students who were
smoking marijuana. I would
have taken them to court if I
could have gathered evidence
legally."

Justice of the Peace Edwin
Lincoln, who levied the line on
the sophomore girl, said that all
fines went to the school fund of
Poweshiek County. This
amounts to between ploooiioo
a month.

schools during the past 14 years,

cent) of the 146 men in the 1968

from buying enough books to
really save money. Uniortu-
nately there is little hope of
doing anything to reduce the
price of books. The turnover is
just not large enough to sell
hooks at discount prices.

The prices of cosmetics and
drugs are set by the wholesale
supplier. According to Lambie,
prices are deliberately high.
The reason is to avoid any
competition with Grinnell mer<
chants. Even if this policy were
abandoned, the volume of drugs
and cosmetics sold is too small
to allow the store to purchase
sufficient quantities which
would be necessary to reduce
prices.

Those sticky price tags can
be removed. Wassom said that
a sunlamp will do the trick. I!
you are iussy you will have to
bake your books, The sticky
tags prevent price switching in
the store and they are con-
venient for the clerks during
the book rush at the beginning
of each semester.

The most important iunction
of the bookstore is to supply
students with the appropriate
texts. This function is not al-
ways luliilled. As a result many
students are without texts for
as long as three weeks. This is
inexcusable. Enough b o o k 3
should be ordered in advance.

Wassom argued that “It’s
hard to guess exactly how
many books will be needed."
He does not have to guess. Free
registration lists indicate ap-
proximately how many students
will be taking each course.
Wassom uses this list when he
orders books. However, many
more students sign up {or a
course than is indicated through
pro-registration. Surplus books
can be sent back. More than
enough books should be ordered
to insure that every student
will have one. some publishers
have stringent regulations re
garding the return of books and
not all books can be returned.
in these inirequent cases, the

college should absorb the loss
(which should not be too great).

Wassom contends that there
is not enough room to allow or-
dering more books than ap<
pears necessary. He added that
lack or adequate space is the
most serious problem concern<
ing the bookstore. Not enough
books can be displayed and the
volumes on the shelves are
crowded together. This makes
finding a particular title very
difficult. The shelves are also
too close together, making it
almost impossible for two
people to look in the same sec<
tion at the same time. IT was-
sum is concerned about this
problem, I think a solution
could be found.

Last year the Library Com-
mittee was presented with a
mandate from the laculty to in-
vestigate the problem of space
in the bookstore. The back or
the store is now used {or stor-
age. This could he transtoi-med
into a display area if another
location were found to serve as
a storage space. While the lac-
ulty committee did not have
sufficient time to investigate all
the possibilities (the mandate
is still before the committee),
some suggestions were pro-
posed. The college building
downtown is equipped with a
service elevator. P e r h a p s
available room there could be
used ior storage space. Another
suggestion was to use a small
section of the service building
for storage. Wassom, however,
was reported to be “complete
ly unwilling to innovate.”

Another possibility would be
to convert the women’s gym
Into a bookstore. Lamhie said
that he was in favor of such a
suggestion, although other uses
for the building have also been
proposed.

if more space were used,
many of the serious problems
could be solved. Enough room
would then be available to stock
a suiiiment number of text-
books. Also, perhaps a greater
number of books (other than
texts) could be purchased at
one time. This would result in
lower prices. l-lopeiully the Li-

Faculty jurors are appointed

The present Judicial Council
signiiicantly differs from the
Judicial Council system oi
three years ago. The earlier
version was very structured and
consisted entirely of students,
Although the council had orig
nal jurisdiction in studese di
cipline cases, its decisions were
reviewed and could be rejected
by the Faculty Committee on
Student Allah‘s. This dualistic
system was replaced by the
present Judicial Council, which
combines a student jury and
iaculty jury by having a single
jury consisting or three stu-
dents and three faculty mem<
hers.

The Judicial Council at Grin-
nell is not powerless, but, to
quote lrom the Grinnell College
Student Handbook: ‘The Judicial
Council shall have original jun
isdiction in all cases in which
violations of college regulations
are alleged to have occurred
except those cases in which the
House Councils have original
jurisdiction.” That is, Judi a]
Council has original jurisdic-
tion in trying any offender oi
the college rules, regardless of
whether he is turned in by his
House, BKtG men, or individual
students, except when the de-
iendant is appealing a verdict
decided upon by his house
Council.

Furthermore, except tor hav-
ing to be approved by President
Leggett, the Judicial Councl]
verdicts are final. Depending on
the seriousness of the crime,
the council may impose fines,
conduct probation, suspension,
or expulsion.

brary Committee will not neg«
lect this problem, and hopeful-
ly Wassom will he more recep<
tive to suggestions in the future.

Non-Profit Institutions Face
Takes on Protitable Sidelines
In Controversial Court Case

By MAREN STEWART

The case of the United States
vs. the Myrna Foundation has
not yet come to court. This

case will determine whether a .

non - protit institution, like
Grinnell, can engage in mon-
sy-making businesses and pre-
serve its tax exemption.

Should the government win
this case. there is already a
Case prepared against Grinnell
to tax tai-m pioperty that Grin-
nell owns. The houses the col-
legs owns, which are rented to
rlew professors, will also be
lubject to such taxation.

The test case goes Io court
In November. Mr. D0 II I 1 l1
Lambie, Treasurer ot the col.
lege, says there is a trend de
veloping to tax non—proﬁt in-
stitutions, and as a result,
indepen dent colleges may
have to go under iederal and
state control in order to to
main open.

“It used to be thought that
we were aiding the stare and
benetitting the citizenry." stat-
ed Lambie. “But now the tie
mand for taxes is so gleat
that the government is almost
narrow-sighted in its desire to
get new taxes."

Mr. Lambie mentioned that

Mr. Lambie noted that there
seem to be inconsistencies in
government policy. it the col-
lege invests endowment funds
In stocks or bonds and re-
ceives dividends, no taxes
must he paid on these. but
{arm property is termed an
"unrelated" activity and
therefore is subject to taxa-
tion. '

Other evidence of this new
trend is the foreign travel bill
that was brought up in Con-
gress last year. in this bill
there was a provision to tax
the travel of those doing busi-
ness for nonprofit institutions
which had formerly been ex-
empt lrorn such taxation. Mr.
Lambie said the passage of
such a bill would sanction tax-
atiorl oi the college ior gaso-
line and other items on which
there is an eXClse tax. “There
is no logic in singling that
(travel) out,” said Lambie.

The bill has not yet been
passed by Congress.

intelligence, attractiveness
and good cooking were the
prime qualities desired in a
wile by Grinnell men accord-
ing to the results of a recent
interview oi 48 college men on
the subject at “What 1 want
my wife to be like."

Three sets at questions were
used in the interview. The
llrst group dealt with lntelll~
gence, beauty, personality,
and a good sense of humor.
The second group dealt with
seriousness and lighthearted-
ness, and the third set asked
the men whether 'they pre<
lerred a blood or u hnmette.
and whether they wanted her
to be able to cook.

Personality was listed as the
important qualiﬁcation trom

beauty, and a good sense of

the men interviewed, 32 per-
cent adjudged personality as
the most essential, 26 percent
voted ior Intelligence, 23 per~
cent tor beauty, and 19 per-
cent tor a good sense at hu—
mar.

lo the second group or ques-
tions, every man demanded

that his wito be both serious
and light-hearted instead of
having only one or these attri-
butes.

Blonds Not Popular

The third set at questions
revealed that either there are
no gentlemen on tho Grinneil
campus, or the old adage that
"gentlemen prefer blonds" is
a misleading aphorism, for on-
ly 4 of the 48 men interviewed
wanted a blond wlfs while 20
desired a brunette. The color
oi the hair made no difference
to u husbands-lobe, and one
man asserted that he did not
care what color hair his choice
had, as long as she was not

KDIG AIRS NEWS,
VIEWS, & MUSIC

KDlC, Grinnell's own radio
station, has begun broadcasting
alter two years of preparation,
The idea {or the station ﬁrst
began two years ago when Ba-
bak Armajeni, '68, organized
the first board of the radio sta~
tiun, It consisted of A station
manager, a personnel director,
all audio purchasing agent, a
news director, a program direc-
tor. a chief engineer, a public-
ity director, and a secretary.

Because Grinnell’s previous
nation (started in 1948) had
gotten in trouble with the FCC
and had consequently lost its
license, the new station had dil-
iiculty in getting its new li-
cense. After this obstacle was
overcome, the broadcasting was
iurther Slowed when the area
housing the station was not
completed, Limited broadcast-
ing did eventually take place
last spring during graduation
week.

Financing ior 1(ch comes
from SSA lunds. Most oi the
equipment in the station itself
was donated by Sherman M.
Fairchild, along wuh money
from alumni.

Because the station is broad
casting 121 hours per week, one
of the keys to its operation \5
the students involved. At the
present time there are 85 stu»
dents on the staif, 40 of whom
are DJ’s. The goal set by the
station is to have all the staff
obtain 3rd class licenses [mm
the FCC.

News for KDIC comes from
several sources. UPl provides
news on a 24 hour basis. Other
news is gotten from outside
newspapers, as well as tram
several c a m p u s reporters.
There are presently 15 people
on the news stall, which Is
headed by Martin Wiesenield
’89.

One of ‘the most important
features of the news staff is the
nightly show from 7 to a PM.
This hour, termed Special pro
grams, is devoted to topics or
Current interest. It includes in-
terviews, taped music features,
or panel discussions at impor»
tant Issues (such as the recent
ones on the grape strike and
the presentation by CBS.)

enteld.

The editorial policy of the sta-
tion is decided each week by
the board of KDIC, consisting
of the Station Manager (AI
Cloud, ‘69), the News Director
Martin Wicsenfeld, ’69), the
Programming Director (Diane
Pomerance, ’69), and one other
member of the board. From
editorials submitted to the sta-
tion each week, one is chosen
and read on the air. Agree

was said may then he sube

As a 17 year old sophomore,
Duncan Wntters entered into a

siderations had come to a head
and he had solidified hls posi-

His beliefs on the war and on

at a military investigation. He
was told by a full colonel that
his case would go all the way in
the Secretary or the Air Forte,
because ROTC had recently
been attacked in Congress as a
haven for draltrdotlgers ml that
Watters’ case was theielore po-
iitioaily sensitive,

“What bothers me about the

is that the services are signing
up boys too young to make ills

(ions of their lives. ROTC IS it

training," continued Walters.
“A liberal arts institution is ii

once we believed these words;
now we are taught that they

Our apathy doesn't really en-
danger the body or human
knowledge, but its implications
for personal growth are great.

The point is that intellectual
exploration does not have to
uncover mental artilacts to be

has involved one to four Grin-

The Newberry Library

By CAROL C. BRADFORD

The Newberry Library Sem-
inar in the Humanities is an
opportunity for scholarly and
independent study in Chicago.
The program is uttered t0 qual-
itied juniors and seniors major
ing in the Humanities ol‘ Social
Sciences. The Seminar concen-
trates on a particular century
each year. This year participat<
ing students will be studying
the 19th Century

The semester is typically di-
vided into tWO periods. The first
six weeks Consists of seminar
sessions in English and History
which the students prepare and
lead themselves. The remaining
two months are devoted to in-
dependent and comprehensive
research. Students may choose
any area or study pertaining to
the century under examination,
Their final academic responsi-
bility is the completion or a pa-
per based upon their research.
These papers are corrected and
published by the Newoerry Li-
brary every year. The program
also otters a wide variety or
guest lecturers, a series of con-
carts, and many social iunctioiie
with the taculty and staff.

An important leatui-e or the
program is the opportunity to
live and study in a city environ<
meni, The Library is located on
the North side of Chicago and
students live in apartments near
by. Students are urged to ex-
plore and take advantage oi the
city as well as the Library Sit-
uated in the “Rush St" or
“nightclub" area, they are with-
in walking distance of the Loop,
Old Town, and beaches on Lake
Michigan. Public transportation
makes it easily accessible to the

South Side where the University
or Chicago and Hyde Park are
located.

The Newberry Seminar thus
has many advantages to it. it
otters the scholarly students the
chance to research thoroughly a
topic within their iields or spe-
cial interests. it gives the silk
dents who are uncertain about
graduate school a realistic idea
about the nature oi graduate
work, And ﬁnally, it offers one
the opportunity to live and study
in a city environment in an inde-
pendent capacity.

Quaiiiied applicants are ex-
pected to have a working back--
ground in history or literature,

though they need not be major-
ing in these iields and are not
required to have special knowl-
edge in the period under ex-
amination. Participants are se-
iccted on the basis of their ac-
ademic standing, their capacity
tor independent study and re-
search, and their interest in
and potential qualiﬁcations for
graduate studies. Preference is
given to students who are also
pmiicient in one or more toreign
languages.

In the past, many students
have been deterred (rrom apply-
ing tor this program. They were
Either misinformed or incorrect-
ly assumed that they had to be
English or l-listory majors to
qualify. This is not the case.
Students from other colleges are

fields.

Editorial . . .
The Wallace Ad

During this past week a debate arose on the
very intricate issue of advertising ethics The debate
was centered on whether or not to publish an ad-
vertisement for George Wallace which we received
from the National Educational Advertising Service.

There were some who thought that such a pub-
lication would constitute an endorsement of the can-
didate, in the same way as when an ad appears in
the Good Housekeeping Magazine, an endorsement
of the advertised product is understood Some ar-
gued that publication of the ad might aid the cam-
paign of Wallace, and since we ought to do nothing
to help him, we should not publish it. Some also
thought that the ads appearance in the S&B would
offend a large number of our readers.

If an advertisement for Nixon or Humphrey had
arrived first, there probably would have been no
difficulty, for these men, while not model candi-
dates, do not stir such deep feelings of hatred as
Wallace. We thought that if one of these ads had
arrived we would have published it, Not to publish
the Wallace ad would have been a kind of political
censorship. Not having published the ad would set
a dangerous precedent for a free newspaper — that
only those whose views are compatible with those
of the editorial staff he represented in the paper in
advertising copy.

The notion that the publication of an advertise-
ment for a candidate constitutes an endorsement is
absurd. Never would this paper endorse a man who
threatens to run over demonstrators. A newspaper
publishes political advertisements because these ads
are a part of the forum on which ideas of the candi-
dates are expressed. The publication of such an ad
is not an endorsement, but is a recognition of the
man’s existence as a candidate.

if we were to run the ad, Wallace might well in-
clude Grinnell College in a list of “liberal" col-
leges where his ad appeared, and this might help
his campaign. Or it might hurt it. Yet if we were to
refuse to run his ad, he might include Grinnell in
a list of colleges who refused to run his ad, and this
also might either aid or hurt his campaign, It is also
uncertain whether the ad itself will be of any help
to him.

We worked strenuously this week to solicit ad-
vertisements from the other major candidates so
that we would not offend the sensitivities of a large
group by publishing the Wallace ad alone. We re-
spect those sensitivities Henceforth, however, it
will be the policy of this newspaper to publish po-
litical ads.

“It’s not a bargain if you don’t need it"

A new gym has been on the priority list of need-
ed constructions ever since the old women's gym
burned down in the late 1930’s. Darby Gymnasium
was originally built to be a temporary structure, to
tide the college over the war years when a new gym
would be built, The Fine Arts Building, the library,
the Forum and the two service buildings all dis-
placed the gym on the list of priorities

According to President Leggett, the renovation
of buildings is not an activity which must await the
completion of new structures. In an interview he in<

dicated that Steiner and ARH are on the agenda to
be renovated this coming summer.

Nevertheless, the planned gym is an excess, It
would fill the needs of a college twice Grinnell’s
size. Only if the college were planning a great in‘
crease in the enrollment would the new gym be jus-
tified, But the college plans no such increase, and
wisely, for a large increase in the number of stu-
dents would significantly change the ethos of the
school.

Could not the college settle for something
humbler? Is the gym a result of pressure from
trustees who see the size of a college’s gym as be-
ing directly proportional to that institution’s worth,
just as in the suburbs one’s status is measured by
the size of his swimming pool?

To save some money the college is not going to
put bleachers in the new gym immediately, so Dar-
by will continue to be used for varsity sports. Would
it not be less extravagant to convert Darby into a
women‘s gym and build a new gym for the men
smaller than the planned complex?

Even if there be good reason for the new gym,
there is no sense in its size.

Corrections

Last week we incorrectly reported the figures
on the election or" Lee Maril. There was confusion
between the SGA office and the S&B office, prob-
ably because of their proximity. Anyway, the cor-
rect figures follow:

Maril — 162
Secrest — 129

In one of last week’s editorials, it may have
appeared as if the David M. Gibson Memorial
Newsletter was the sole contributor of the commu-
nity bicycles. In fact, there were 15 persons who
collected funds for the bicycles. Two were contrib-
uted by the DMGMN, six by this group of fifteen.

This is not true.

cott against Bates wuuld be
pointless.

Nevertheless, other florists
in your hometowns may buy
their Carnations lrom Kltaya-

Florist Workers strike for de-
cent wages and union recogni-
tion, you should ask before
you buy. You can also support

Grinnell's Image: The Catalogue

Among the many useful and
entertaining publications oi
oi Grinnell College—the Stu-
dent Handbook, the annual
class schedule, the Slim—the
most important and represem
tative, at least in design and
Icope, is the college catalogue.
The 1968-9 edition contains
both the words ”catalog" (sic)
and "bulletin,” Were we to
speak strictly -- a thing in-
decorous by the college’s own
standard at “unpretentious
manners“ (p. ll)—wa should
call the publication neither I
catalogue nor a bulletin, for it
contains much more than a
listing 01 items and it has no
such sanction as a papal bull.
To justify the two titles, how-
ever one might support "cata-
log" by pointing to the list
of the courses offered—still the
largest section of the book—
on pp. 99—160 and their support
"bulletin” by observing the
extensive use made of the new
scarlet seal, reminiscent or the
president’s medallion.

Catalogues do not, by defini-
tiun, otter justifications of
their existence; at college cat-
alogue always offers such jus-
tification ~ and in cata-
logues put out by such schools
as Goddard College, for exam~
pie, the entire catalogue is de-
voted to justification, since no
courses are offered, in good
philosophical f a s h l o n, the
Grinnell college catalogue be-
gins with “The Objectives of
the College" (1). 11). The cps
ening sentence, despite its illit-
erate use of "than," is worth
Quoting:

"Grilmell College exists to
help shape the character and
quality of each or its students,
to make each one I dllterent
and better human being than
he might have been had it not
been for his years in Ihe com-
munity of Grinnell Colleger”

There is a certain neatness—
worthy of a commercial ad-
vertisement—in opening and
closing the sentence with the
words “Grinnell College”, One
might wish ior some mention
of the mind, but the reverse
hendiadys “character and
quality” allows the reader to
assume its presence. Less hap-
py is the phrase “a difierent
and better human being”;;
myselt, l object to the assump
tion that difference necessar-
ily implies betterness. Despite
the general gaucheness of our
students, the culture of Amer.
lca, its “character and quali-
ty", seem to me something to
be built on and developed rath-
er than something to be made
different.

The means used by the col-
lege in achieving this aim is
described as "creating and
maintaining a lively environ-
ment of constructive tradition
and unpretentious m a n n e r s."
Grinnell may have shed its
lcrmal ties with Christianity
but its Christian heritage or
being all things to all men
shows forth bright and clear
in this sentence, which is more
sophisticated than the sort of
prose which used to grace the
catalogue oi Parsons College
but which is not materially
dillerent. Given that general

statement of means, Grinnell,
too, ought to have a “tradition
committee".

All this, however, is prob-

ably no more than the usual
awkwardness we all feel in
speaking lormally. By the end
of the first paragraph we are
reading prose which reminds
us that Grinnell, for all its
shortcomings, is a place worth
knowing:
"Above all, the college tries to
emphasize the force of ideals,
the relationship between pri-
vate and public responsibility,
the saving qualities of art and
luughter, and the sense that
knowledge, wisdom, and un-
derstanding come lrom an n.-
wareness of others and not
just one/s sell.”

Rapidity of change—a char-
acteristic of Grinnell that oiten
suffers from the defects of its
qualities — has always made
putting out a catalogue at
Grinnell a tricky job. in the
past, when the catalogue came
out almost as late as the year-
book, it described what the
College had done rather than
what it was going to do; hence,
when it was accurate, it was
out of date. This year, with
incredible energy, the admin-
istratinn has published the cat-
alogue at the beginning of the
year; as a result, though it is
up to date, it is not always
accurate. l omit such cavils as
the ascription oi Protessor
Kleinschrnidt to the German
Department, for such errors
are one of the ills that mind
is heir to: somewhat more de
pressing, however, is the de
scription oi the Humanities
course (p. 23) as containing
"masterpieces of. . .history”.
When the old and ill-iated
“Historical Studies” course
was metamorphosed into “So-
cial Studies", the Humanities
staff dropped its one historical
work—Thucydides—on the as-
sumption that it was to be
picked up by the new course
in social studies. Alas, Thucy-
dides disappeared into the pro
vincial limbos ot the Department
or History oi Classical Lan-
guages to be replaced by in-
vestigations into the life of Tro-
bruk Islanders and other Cul-
tures “presenting western man
in successive periods of his his-
tory.”

Even though the College has
caniessed its error in judg-
ment—that Grinnell freshmen
are too good to need orthodox
courses in freshman composi-
tion — by adding a “Writing
Lab,” it takes no more than a
casual reading or upperclass
papers to see that the “rigor-
ous training in the writing of
the English language", men~
tioned on p. 24, is a pious hope
rather than a legitimate
claim.

in a section entitled “Per-
spective on Liberal Educa-
tion” (1:. 30), the catalogue is
unusually frank in stating that
“Gril‘lnell is seeking a com-
promise” —- so typical an As
merican ambition —- between
European comprehensive ex-
inations and American
fragmentation 01 courses,

The Paul Butteriield Blues
Band performed in concert
last Saturday evening in Rob-
erts Theatre. The two hour
long periormance was enthus-
iastically received by the
Grinnell audience.

Butterfield has been estab-
lished during the last few
years as the most popular or
the white blues revivalists.
This reputation is deserved in
that he is a superb harp play<
er; his interest in music su-
persedes the “blues" struc-
tures, enabling him to work in
additional forms; and he can
create a rapport (not neces-
sarily musical) with his audi-
ence. The reputation is sur—
prising in that Eutteriield is
an atrocious vocalist, his rhy-
thm sections are rarely go.
gether, and his approach to
the blues form is oiten pre-
dictable and therefore monotoa
nous. It was apparent at the
Grinnell concert from the out-
set that his appeal is some-
what non-musical. when you
go to hear B.B. King or hobby
Blue Bland, you can expect to
hear the blues sung and
played Wiﬂ‘i masterful convic-
tion. arrangements tightly and
economically conceived, and a
band that works together.

You go to a Butterﬂeld con-
cert partially as it it were a
happening. rho musicians all
possess the necessary youth
and exterior hiphess that the
audience digs. Some members
of this kind of audience re-
spond with such great em-
pathy to this scene that if you
tell them their “musical" idols
are not saying anything, they
take it as a personal insult.
(Anybody who doesn't like the
Cream is a iascist pig.) The
Butterfield band realizes this,
of course, and exploits the fact
to make up ior any musical
ineptitude. What p.13. King
can convey with any one note
song or plucked, the Butter-
iield Band tries to achieve
with eilects that are not al-
ways musical. (A couple or
times the bassist got so tired,
i imagine, of lighting tar me-
ter with the drummer, he just
laid out for a few bars. When
the drummer was losing his
sticks and knocking over his
drums, was he being hip or
incompetent?)

Paul Butterlleld (mlddk), Ind pm at the bond.

Several bad and a few inter
esting features or the band
were emphasized during the
first six numbers. The horns
were utilized only for familiar
riffs. The bass kept a compes
tent, even imaginative rhyths
mic undercurrent going. The
guitarist had several lnterest<
ing moments: I constantly had
the feeling that he did not
want to be playing blues. He
is not a “finished" player but
he is an interesting one.

Butteriield had several ex-
cellent harp solos but his vo~
cals reminded me of Miles
Davis’ attack of Oscar Peter-
son: "He even had to learn
how to play the blues." But-
terfield whoops, yells, “flats"
all the right notes, and does
everything else that the text
books tell you will make 1
blues, but he is not convincing.
when as. sings, you listen,
humbled by what the man is
conﬁdently putting down. but.
terfield, on the other hand,
whines them out, believing, av.
idently, that this will prove he
had the blues. 1 didn't believe
him.

When somebody had an idea
and the drummer should have
been accompanying, he pounds
ed the Cow bell. When the solo-
ist took a break, you would
look at the drummer expect-
antly, but he was patting his
cymbal.

The worst thing about tho
first six numbers was the lack
of freedom. Some soloists have
enough mastery of form to
sound free regardless of the
harmonic rules.

With the seventh number,
the “jazz number,” the Butter-
iield band began to work.
They began with an interest-
ing riff, that sounded like
something out of the Basie
book of the thirties, From
there, the music evolved into
tree jazz. Suddenly, everybody
became hippy and seemed to
care. The sax player took a
few alto choruses that showed
technical fluency, but showed,
also, an unsure rhythmic com
oeption.

Butterlield took his most ex-
citing solo oi the evening when
he balanced a series of stacat-
to notes against longer and
more complex phrases.

And then there was Dinwid.
die. Gene Dillwiddie’s tenor
solo was the high point of the
concert. His lengthy solo was
accompanied at ﬁrst by the
band. then by the rhythm Sec<
tion, then the conga, and then
he played alone. i personally
ielt like jumping up and
screaming. He had the techni-
cal fluency to carry out his

-lines (amazingly long phras-

es), to use the “hidden regis-
ter,” and to balance the lower
and middle octaves

Butteriield, hip to the tavor.
able audience reaction, lol-
lowed it with an uptempo
“Get Out My life, Woman.”

In Ellington’s words, it was
a "concert to be there." Much
of it that would have sounded
dull on a record, was made
alive and entertaining by the
spirit of the group, and this
general feeling was projected.
And Geno Dinwiddio is some-
thing else.

, SELECTIVE SERVICE: WAYS AND MEANS

By DON HECKER

(Author‘s Note: I wish in ex-
press my gratitude to Wendy
natson for her help in the pro.
paration 0f till! article. Without
her aid, this article would not
have been possible.)

The Selective Service System
’(55) of the United States is
one of the most peculiar insti-
tutions ever to occur in a free
society. The debate over the
morality of conscription aside,
the Selective Service System
itself cannot be said to encour-
age freedom of action

In fact, the stated aim oi the
system is to “channel” (coerce)
men into activities that are in
“the national interest" (ac-
cording to the opinion of the
SS, not necessarily according
to your own).

Perhaps it is because most
systems of moription degen-
erate into small<scale dictator<
ships that Americans have tra-
ditionally resented efforts to be
drafted into wars.

This is a particularly inter-
esting point to those of us who
have grown up in the shadow
of the Selective Service, for we
have tended to classify it in
the “fact of life" category.

Yet in the 200 years of U5.
history, draft calls have been in
effect fewer than do years, and
the longest draft by far has
been the one that is operating
presently.

Resistance

The recent outbreak of draft
card burnings, mass rallies,
and general resistance is prob-
ably one of the least explosive
American reactions to a draft.

The first United States draft,
in 1863, was met by rioting so
severe that federal troops had
to be dispatched from Gettys-
burg to bring New York City
back under the control of the
cil/il authorities.

The second draft, during
World War I, was responsible
for an action of protest known
as the “Roasting Ear Rebel-
lion," which was somewhat less
dramatic than its name implies,
but which does indicate tha
depth of antagonistic feeling
toward conscription.

The important point of these
historical notes is that it is
traditional for Americans to de-
spise conscription. and for
them to resist it in every
mariner, Including violence.

The deep-seated suspicion of
conscription has proven, at
least in the case of the present
draft, to he well-founded.

Channeling Manpower

According to the U.S. Consti-
tution, Congress is given the
right to “raise armies.” The
Selective SerVice System, re-
authorized under the Military
Selective Service Act oI 1967, is
the agent through which Con
gress raises these armies.

However, the Selective SerV<
ice System, without any specii<
ic or general authorization, has
quietly expanded its activitics
to include the basic philosophy
of coercing men into certain oc—
cupations which it has dECldEd
are desirable,

The term that the 35 system
uses to describe this activtty is
“channeling manpower,"

In the System's own words,
“manpower channeling" is “the

process of channeling by not
Iaking men irom certain activ-
ities who are otherwise liable
for service, or by giving defer-
ments to qualified men in cer-
tain occupations, is actual pros
cumment hy inducement of
manpower for civilian activi-
ties which are manifestly ln till
national interest."

The effect of this, again in
the system's own words, is that:

“In the less patriotic and
more selfish individual (that
may easily be read as anyone
who disagrees with the policy
of conscription — and they may
mean you) it engenders a sense
of fear, uncertainty and dissat-
isiactlon which motivates him,
mvenhelass, in the some direc-
tion (that Ihc SS wished hi
to be motivated in).

“He would wpmiale ti cer-
tain future with no prospect of
military service or civilian m
tributloll, but he complies."

The SS system is also aided
in making these rather sweep
ing value judgments as to
what is good and bad for the
country and its individual citi‘
zens by certain boards that
deal with specific areas, In
lowa, for example, a scientific
ndVisory board suggests to the
State Selective Service which
industrial occupations are es
sential.

Theory and background is
useful to 18-35 year-olds only in
helping them to better under-
stand the general direction of
the SS system. The operational
facts are more important.

The present Selective Service
System was authorized by Con-
gress in 1951 — only two years
alter tho World War II draft
was repealed,

Technically, the base of pow-
er ol the SS is the 3-5 men who
make up each local board.
These men are appointed by the
President, on the recommanda<
tion of the State Director at
Selective Service, Each Local
Board serves approximately a
one-county area. Three board
members are required for a
,quorum, and many boards have
only a total of three members,

Actually, the power of the lo-
cal board resides not so much
with those as men, who are
unpaid volunteers, as it does
with the‘ Executive Secretaries
of the Boards.

These persons, salaried pro
isssionals, and generally wom-
en (oddly, often middle-aged
and unmarried) handle the day-
to»day paperwork of the SS,

They are required to sit in on
the bi-monthly meetings (meek
ings are held more often, if it
is necessary to process the leg-
istrants) where they “recom-
mend” action to the Board.
These “recommendations" arn
then almost routinely followed.

An extremely important point
to bear in mind about the poll-
tics of the SS is Ihnt the word
“recommendatlon” carries 00W
slderably more weight than the
diciionary‘s definition. “Recom-
mendations" are Vlrtually al.
ways followed, and the likeli-
hood that is “recommendation"
will not be followed is about the
same as Gen. Hershey’s attack-
ing the philosophy of oortscrip
lion.

In many cases a good im-
pression on the local board's

Executive Secretary is almost
equal to deferment, and a bad
impression is equal to an in.
duction notice.

The Local Boards, incidental-
ly, are one of the few political
entities that direct their own
fate without outside pressure.
Policies are continued intact
because each Local Board
“recommends" informally to
the State Director who should
be chosen to fill any vacancy,
and the State Director, in turn,
“recommends" to tho Presi-
dent who should be appointed.
Membership in either the Vets
erans of Foreign Wars (VFW)
or the American Legion seems
to be the chief prerequisite for
being appointed to ii Local
Board.

APPEALS AGENTS

Each Local Board has a med
lcal advisor, and a Govem-
merit Appeals Agent. Both an
unpaid volunteers.

The medical advisor reviews
registrants‘ files when asked,
and makes “recommendations"
to the Local Board.

The Government Appeal:
Agent, however, is In 0 r a
important. Each regis-
trant has the right to ho coun-
seled by his Appeals Agent
whenever the registrant be<
lieves he has been unfairly
classifiedr

The Agent is required to help
the registrant prepare a case
for presentation to the Local
Board. He also informs the reg-
lstrant of his rights in the
process of appeal, and continues
to help him with his case until
some conclusion is reached.

unpaid volunteers like the
Appeals Agents are unlikely to
be generous with their time,
and in this case, such poison.
ony may favor the registrant.
The Appcals Agents is required,
not merely to consider the In—
terests ot the registrant, but to
consider equally the interests
of the registrant and the Local
Board.

The result is obviously not
good for the interests of the
registrant. In other words, if
you are considering something
outside the ss laws, don’t tell
the Appeals Agent.

The decisions of the Local
Board can be appealed to State
Boards of Review, which have
the right to overturn local des
cisions.

Registrants should always
keep in mind this appeals proc-
ess Beinre taking any aclion,
and certainly before accepting
as final decisions of a Local
Board, registrants should con-
tact a qualified Draft Counsel-
or (other than the Appeals
Agent).

There is one Soday period
during which the registrant can
appeal to any higher source
within the system until he
reaches the President,

FREE STORE WELFARE FARES WELL

The Free Store, in its short
existence, has helped to dent
the old adage that nothing can
be gotten for free. Even mom
remarkable, considering tho
typical Grinnell temperament,
is the fact that more items are
added each day than are found
to be missing.

Adorning the walls of the
Store, located in the Loose Hail
cloakroom, are various items
such as a Greeting from the
President Dr 3 Draft Induction
Notice, sign-up lists for students
who wish to do, or want some-
thing done for them for free,
and such signs as “Privata
Property is Theft," ”it's all free
because its yours," “America
is the land of the free" “Free
means you don't pay, and
“Tell it to Gwen and get lots of
T. ,C." There is one sign which
might give the store a didactic
purpose, which reads ”Civiliza<
tion Has To Be Rebuilt in Every
Age."

Among some of the newer
Items in the Store is a digger-
circulating “Liberation Shirt,"

which signifies one‘a “libera-
tion" from private property, a
Irishea, toilet paper, a 650 piece
jigsaw puzzle, and two sugar
cubes, Significance of which is
Belfcvidant.

The Free Store's ultimate Sm
cial experiment is an empty
Pepsi can which serves as a
deposit for communal money
(to which good use was already
made by a nameless student
who needed three dollars to fix
a flat tire on her bike).

The idea of a Free Store on
the Grinnell campus belongs
to Bruce Nissen (Loose Junior)
who wishes to point out, in the
communal spirit which per-
vades the store, that many stu-
dents are taking part in its op
eration and that they deserve
most of the credit for the store's
success.

however, to point out that tha
“liberatlo is still incomplete,
tho following sign may be found
in the store: “Any Furnitur-
Is Not Part Of The Free Store.
It Belongs To Loose Hail, so
Don't Take It."

It is, of course, only fair to
point out that the catalogue is
an honest reflection of Grin-

CHEM DEP’T. PLANS RESEARCH

By CAROL BRADFORD

The Chemistry Department Is
involved in basic research with
potential practical applications
as well as curriculum improve-
ment. Professors Swensan, Dan-
torlh, Erickson, and Oelke are
continuing their works The two
new members of the depart-
ment. Professors Macalady and
Wubbeis, are expecting to begin
projects.

J a c k Swanson, chairman
at the department, Is studying
New Lossen Rearrangement
Precursors. His is a new ups
pmach using a long understood
reaction. The research is highly
theoretical now, HS he is at-
tempting to iind precursors
which are more stable and less
reactive than the chemicals
currently used. Eventually the
research may have important
practical applications as a
means of preparing industrially
usetnl lsocyanates lo be used in
making urethane {Dam polym-
ers.

Luther Erickson is on
leave to oonlmue his research
on Platinum (i1) Complexes
with Amino Acids. This work re-
lates indirectly to cancer chem-

otherapyt The work of Erickson
and Neville (now at Purdue in-
dlanapolis Regional Campus) is
part of the National Institutes at
Health supported cancer pro—
gram. The research is not ban
to but could lead to important
discoveries in the understanding
and treatment of cancer.

Joseph Dantorth is con-
tinuing studies on the decompo-
sition of inorganic salts at rot
Iatively low temperatures Thin
research was conducted over
the summers During the year
Daniorth will continue his or:-
ginal and fundamental research,
He has invented a piece or
equipment which makes this re-
search possible, opening up an
entirely new area of study. Dan-
rnrth also worked on the devel-
opment of the new curriculum
for the Science Ii course which
he is new teaching

William Oelke was en-
gaged in two projects during the
summer. One was improving the
lab in the instrumental analySls
course aiiered by the Depart-
merit. oelke is also editor and_
part author of an Experimental
Phystcal Chemistry hook to
come out this winter.

WE CAN‘T FOLLOW
THE LOGIC

Recently the curriculum com-
mittee decided to release
through the College News ser-
vice the names of all students
(who maintained the average or
k plus or better ior the second
aemester. Along with this de-
'ision was made the ruling that
luch material cannot be re-
ﬁned as a new: story for local

nsumptiou.

Naturally enough. we cannot
see the logic in the reasoning,
although it seems to be in line
with the local policy. We will
grant that the story is probably
not of stupendous importance.
Itill we believe that the attitude
at the committee is at fault.

The excuse given {or prohibit-
ing local publication is that ii
{will stir up competitive jeolous<
ies among the students, Perhaps
it would, although we are in.
Flilled to think that this danger
is overemphasized. But never-
theless. why release the mater-
lsl at all?

We suppose that the action
was taken in order to secure
some puhllciiy in diiierent state
papers, and ill so doing to give

this is so. then we ask; why not
release the material on the cam-
pus whero real recognition could
be given, and where it would be
appreciated more than it would
as a five line item in some daily
paper, it run at all?

We feel that this action on
the part oi the curriculum oom-
n-litteo in illogical, to any the
least, and it is indicative of
the general tendency to look
down upon the Scarlet and
Black as “just the college news-
paper", and is a partial exs
planation oi the reluctance with
which certain members of tho
administration will release in-
formation to the paper.

of the committee was wrong.
and that much more might have
been accomplished it something

abolition of grades or some
other new scheme. At any rateI
nothing was gained by suppressr

cation.

'OIES ROII. 28-0;

CORNELI. NEX'I

; By REGGIE GRAHAM

' The football team lost to St.
blai last Saturday, 28-0. “They
were just a better ball club,"
according to Coach Bowers. The
“Oles”, with twenty-two return-
Ing lettermen, were picked to
Win the Midwest Conference
championship by a poll or the
conference coaches. Grinnell
hasn’t put up a foo all team to
match the upper division teams
in a couple oi years, and no one
seriously expected this year to
show any difference. The true
goal of this year‘s team is to
have a respectable season, win-
hing at least half. This will be
a difficult task, considering the
two bad seasons we just came
through.

One of our biggest problems
this year will be lock or experi-
once. The sophomores have add-
ed some size and potential, as
well as spirit, but just haven't
played any varsity toothall. As
one or them put it, ‘We all real<
ly want to win, but we just don't
know how" John Czerwinski
played a good game as defensive
ﬁnd, as did Bruce Rollins
‘(whose injury could put him out
for as much as two weeks).
'Another sophomore, Roy Lewis,
looked good except for the tact
that no one was able to make
a hole for him to go through.
POI) Lillis did a iine job, and Al
Cloud was great (13 tackles».

John Busweli is coming along,
but the fact that he was away
from football for a year still
hurts his game. Don Kraitsik
looked good, catching a few
passes tor short yards. Overall,
the team did almost as well as
could be expected against an.
perlor size and experience.

Tomorrow’s game will be the
real test, and pass defense will
be particularly important. in
the past. Cornell has thrown
70% of in plays. Ric Vranek,
probably the quickest man in
our pass defense, should have a
busy day. Another big factor
will be our defensive line, which
must put lots of pressure on the
passer.

Cornell beat us in the last two
years by a total of seven points
(2124, 23-24). The year oeiore
last, they won in the llnal thirty
seconds, last year, the last quan-
ter. These memories, as well as
the rivalry between the two
schools, should add some tire to
our desire for victory. A win
would do wonders for our team’s
morale (and the students’), We
must also face the fact that a
win tomorrow could make the
difference between a respect-
able middle standing and anoth-
er year at the bottom or the
conierence list. The team needs
your support. Go to the game
tomorrow at 1:30. Fat Rog says
we’re going to win [or surel

PIONEERS BOOT CORNELL 4-2;

By YVOR STDAKLEY

' To start the season on the
right foot, Grinneli's soccer Pio-
Iieers booted Cornell 4-2 on the
strength of three goals by Bruce
Graham, Student-Coach John
Hemingway described his team
as ”showing real guts."

"For the iirst time, the guys
rhowed tremendous poise." com-

ented Coach Hemingway.
'Though inexperience hurt us
Hometimes, they showed good
desire and hustle.”

Though off to a shaky start,
Grinnell's Pioneers quickly took
control and worked up a so lead
at half-time. The scores came
on a penalty kick by Honorary
Field Captain Bruce Graham,
and a goal by Carl Brenner, rho
iirst tally of the game came on
a spectacular pass play irom
left wing, Dave North, on Gra-
ham.

Cornell fought back aiter tho
bait to a 3-2 margin, but a later

field goal on a penalty kick put
the game out of reach.

The Pioneers bafﬂed Cornell
by continually changing ofierl<
slve patterns. Coach Hemin .
way, who believes that “im-
nesse” is the name of the game,
employed code words to riddle
his opposition’s defense.

The Pioneers, who last year
ground out a 1-7 season, started

Defends Ladylika
Jocks From Slur:

By CINDY ROOT

Contrary to last week’s lard.
cle, which l supposedly wrote,
the girls’ ﬁeld hockey team
does not “maul” their oppo,
nents, nor do they leave their
manners in the dressing room.
when are people going to real.
Ize that “athlete" is not a syn<
onym for animal, and that all
"jocks" are not male. Sports
are a healthy outlet, and a safe
way to ease irostrations. it is
a shame that because oi the
masculine jack image tacked on
many girl athletes today, a lot
of girls are denied this enriching
experience.

The girls on the hockey field
are not lacking in femininity]:
neither are they lacking in drive
and desire, it is an exciting mo-
ment when you can feel the
parts of a team pull together
and the strength of a group oi
people who care well up insida
you. Experiences like this can.
not help but sharpen the mind
as well as tune up the body.
We are not out to play the
game to win, we are out to have
fun. and we want to will, it is
the feeling, not the result that
really matters.

Our team of uniformless min-
utemen (we rationalize; otter
all, look what happened to the
redcoats in the Revolutionary
warl) downed tho suitedrup
Iowa State team last weekend
(H). Little Jamie Rosenbiatt
sneaked behind the enemy lines
three times in the first hall, to
score our first three goals. With
the help of our strong defense—-
Cindy Maier, Heather Fonts,
Cathy Ellis and Marcia David‘
we kept our goalie Connie Ben-
ham from touching even one
ball the whole game. The sec-
ond half telt stronger than the
first as our team began to work
together. Jamie scored another
rush goal, and Mimi Euntz and
Cindy Root added two more to
the total. Getting the season
oil to such a good start we feel
we will be a pretty big threat to
U.N.l. next weekend. Lookout,
the minutemen are coming!
