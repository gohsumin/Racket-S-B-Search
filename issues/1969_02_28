Paranoia Prohibiis
Useful Discussion

By RICH SCHMIECHEN

The most astute comment at the dis-
lussiun of the ”Grinnell Experience” last
Sunday was made by Mrl Liggett: no
one need worry about the continued
existence or the liberal arts college
since the Electoral College has lasted 50
long. Liggett, along with Mr. Leggett,
Mr, Parzen, and Mr. Gurofi participated
in a panel discussion and general gripe
session in the South Lounge.

President Leggett outlined what he
thought were the three greatest prob
lems lacing Grinnell: education of black
students; illustration to the public that

rinnell students are diverse and not
omngeneous: and a rational assess
ment at “risk a taking" underlying
curriculum, student participation in
college policy making, residential living,
and interdisciplinary matters. The prolr
lems oi the Black students must not be
belittled, but those or taking "risks" and
the college's student image seem less
yhan the’ most central issues. Too much

‘r'lsk-worrying" leads to too much delay,
too much needless nervousness, and too
much wasted energy, ”Images" are
elusive and impossible to control. They’re
the problem of the RR. department,
while the library, student representa-
tion, the curriculum, and {underaising
(tan be dealt with by the whole college
bommunity.

Yet‘ Mr. Leggett should (and I mean
this sincerely) be congratulated for
taking the risk of joining the panel
discussion. His presence at a public
meeting was one or the few positive
values of the discussion And who
could blame him for wishing to es«
cape those nasty, complaining stu-
dents at the meeting and, even more,
that large “silent. majority,“ sitting
llstlessly on the soft forum carpeting?

Prof. Guroif, in spite of his innovations
In class, was unwdling to take risks at
the discussion. Gurdtt, having given a
hazy introductory speech (including such
acute perceptions as there is a "failure
of communication between students and
faculty), answered “dangerous" ques-
tions by stating that, after all, he has
only been at Grinnell for six months. He
put on that protective shield which lnsu-
totes and isolates so many professors
and students at Grinnell.

Professor Parzen has the reputation
for taking risks. in his opening, speech,
he stated that the academic instltution
exists for the students (a revolutionary
concept to some) and it is a place for the
”welding together or imagination and
knowledge." The raculty instead or
“teaching" should provide a way for stu-
dents to find answers for themselves. Fa-
culty members should be both advisors
and counselors to students, and Pane“
finally recommended that a dept. of in-
tcrdisciplinary studies be established.

Prof. Panen sat silently through most
of the rest at the chaos, Nearly every-
one else at the meeting seemed to be in
terested in bludgeoning others for their
own rigth and their own seliprouection.
it‘s not that "silence is golden," but
nastiness and selfish self-protection are
even less so. There was little else at this
discussion.

PRESIDENT LEGGETT and 3 faculty
members participated in a panel on
the “Grinnell Experience" Sunday in
the South Lounge.

leggell Announces
Tu‘i’ilnn Increase

president Leggett announced Friday a
$175.00 increase in fees for the 1969—70
academic year, bringing the total com-
preliensive fee tor one year at Grinnell
to $3,275. Tuition has increased from
$2,125 to $2,270, This amount, in accord-
ance with the Trustees' policy, covers
approximately two-thirds of the actual
educational Cast for each student, Other
increases from costs of food and health
services will also be made, totaling an
additional $30.

In a letter to Grinnell parents Presi-
dent Leggett explained the major rea-
sons for the increases along with a
general forecast of the financial situa-
tion. He said, “The major reasons for
the increases are (l) the continuing ins
tense competition for and the rising
salaries or highly qualified scholar
teachers, and (2) higher staii wages and
student labor wages, together with the
general inflation of costs. These rea‘
sons are of course not unique to Grinnell.
All colleges and universities, public and
private, are facing financial problems.
This is indicated by the fact that among
the to colleges belonging to the Asso-
clated Colleges of the Midwest (of which
Grinnell is one), the projected increases
in comprehensive charges for next year
range from $160 to $405, with an average
or $227 per institution.

"We expect a very substantial in«
crease in operating costs for 1969-70.

SENATE POSlPOtlES ELECTION;
Referendum lo Decide SGA Future

Thursday afternoon, an emergency
open Senate meeting was called to re-
consider the Senate's earlier decision

' to postpone the SGA elections until some

data before the final legal date of March
15 and their motion calling for a refer-
endum to abolish all parts of student
government excluding the Finance Com-
mittee.

The request for a reconsideration
came from two candidates, John Herr
and Jim Lew, who had not been informed
of the motion, two senators, and several
students. With 150 students in the audi-
ence, the members of the Senate
described the petition whlch was cir-
culatcd to postpone the scheduled eleo<
tions and its 8-2 ratification.

The discussion involved the specific
platforms of the Candidates and the
need to have an SGA president or Sen<
ate at all, in response to the involvement
and interest of the student body.

The referenduin’s purpose was clari-
ﬁed and argued by Dan Cheifetz

and Diane Pomerance as not being an
attempt to do away with student gov‘
ernment but to make the student body
think about, and possibly reconstruct, a
new representative government. The
Board of Elections will handle the elec-
tions for SGA as in the previous years.
The decision of the election date at a
yet undetermined time before Saturday.
March 15, was re-atfirmad.

The Senate decision and Wednesday
morning’s withdrawal or a candidate
have called into question the way the
races have been nin this Week. According
to Lee Maril, who originated the petition
for postponement, ”I think it Shows what:
people think about student government."
The petition, which obtained 210 signa-
tures in an hour and a half on Wednes-
day night, states, “We believe that the
student interest necessary tor a respon-
sible student government is not present
at this time,” a feeling indicated also by
a candidate to whom Maril talked about

Box 64th

Attorney Enich, assisted by Assistali!
S t a te Attorney General, Douglas
Carlson and Robert Alvine of the AttuiV
ney General’s office, called nine wit<
hesses, eight of them Grinnell students.
The defendants were represented by
their attorney, Dan Johnston of Des
Moines, and his partner, Lawrence Ls
Tourneau.

The hearing was held in an atmos<
phcre of apparent friction between the
county attorney and the eight student
witnesses. Students seemed reluctant to
say any more than the absolute mini-
mum and many seemed uncertain about
whether or not they had to give testi-
mony. The state generally asked the
same questions of its witnesses: whether
they had attended the Gates discussion
on February 5, it they “noticed anything
unusual," whether they observed the
defendants in attendance, and what the
“appearance" of the defendants Was.

One witness, James Sebem, ’69, 60v
editor of ,the Cyclone, was asked if he
had taken any pictures of the incident.
He said that he had and gave some to
the prosecution. The county attorney
asked him if he had taken any other
pictures, and Sebem stated that he had
destroyed the other pictures and nega-
tives after he determined that they
would not be needed for the yearbook,
and when he heard that they could be
subpoenaed as evidence.

5&3 editor Susan Kaeser was also
Called as a witness. The state asked the
usual questions but neglected to ask her
to identify the defendants in the Court<
room by sight. On these grounds, John-
ston moved that her testimony be strickv
en, and his motion was allowed.

Truth in Packaging

The KRNT television special on Grinnell began with some
stock footage of long-haired, wildly gesticulating college students
throwing things and shouting God knows What. A campus riot, in
other words. It went on to show approximately 10 minutes of
what could just as well have been stock footage: a “respectable”
picture of student life exemplified by Gl‘innell College. My argu-
ment with the program is based not on whether or not Grinnell
life is respectable, but rather that the show served simply as an—
other 3x5 card in that catalogued, categorized index of cliched
“images” which the program was supposedly intended to dispel.

There is nothing Wrong, and a good deal right, with such
wholesome Grinnell activities as Uncle Sam’s Club, inter-racial
house, CBS’s playing basketball, AWARE, or scholarship winners.
But in attempting to present this as a true picture of Grinnell
life—and thereby in effect relegating equally important aspects
of student life such as dissention and protests to the position of
campus abnormalities—somehow, a great disservice is done to
both the college community and to the public in general. After
all, the numbers of students involved in'each of the wholesome
activities is a minority of the student body, just as those who
participated in the disrobing incident were. To designate some
minorities as “the way today’s students really are,” and others

FREDRICKA NELSON talking wilh her neighbor Vanesa.

talk of the town

as “a loudspoken but unrepresentative fringe,” is not only a dis-
tortion of the truth but a misleading categorization as well.

I hope the college administration is not as pleased with the
program as I imagine they very well may be. Mr, Leggett spoke
the other night of the need for diversity on Grinnell’s campus,

but this program seemed to belie
students on this campus, individuals,

that appeal. There are many

who find different ways to

participate in campus life. To select any partcular group of indi—
viduals as representative of the entire student body is both un-

fair and unfounded, whether they be

clean-cut or not. If diver-

sity is the call, let’s not try to lump all students into an homogen-

ized, blemish-free

product for public consumption. Let’s con~

tinue to provide pictures of campus life such as the KRNT pro-
gram, which was accurate even if cliched, but at the same time

let‘s provide the whole

picture. And if the public comes knock-

ing on our door looking for the picture of a typical middle-class,
apathetic, self-centered student, let us have the honesty to say,
“I’m sorry, you’ve come to the wrong place.” '

 

IRE
' Who Killed the 5%?

By ROGER KOENKER

Some may say it was a suicide, but
those who knew her best could never
swallow that. This was no simple death
irom lack of love, though God knows her
suitors are unsuited. No, our lady of
Burling basement, the Forum, of open-
rooms, and TV sols would not have died
except by some more complex malaise.
No common weavil (apathy) could kill
our Sturdy Student Government.

The sight or the Right honorabls
(Grim) Reaper at the meeting of Presi-
dential candidates in ARK was no ap-
paritlon, and, as those who were there
can testify, the smell of death was thick
as all the suitors spoke. Only Grim had
the courage to explain his proposal. Some
will say that the thousand students who
missed that historic meeting murdered
our lair friend. Others will (and did) in-
dict those "adventurers in morality and
politics” who have ravaged the innu~
cent Miss S.G.A. Everyone knows the
story, “HOW SUSAN G. ANTHONY
FELL INTO THAT CROWD 0F UN-
WASHED PINKO FREAKS AND WAS
DEFLOWERED AND DISGRACED."
But who knows why she is now aban-
doned and why no knight has come to
cave her honor?

Once there was a populist conﬁdence
In the students of this college that made
student government a podium of at
least potential power. Student solidarity
seemed to have the power to transform
me college. S.G.A. elections meant a
month of vigorous debate over the aims
of the college and the needs of students.
With the process went a great deal of
politics unaltered by thought. But poli-

tics here recharged a sense of idealism
and‘puxposo that made it a useful exer-
cise. In large part, the idealism of
elections arose out of a sense of group
consciousness and student unanimity ol
mind about issues like women’s hours,
open dorms, and credit-fail gradlng.
These issues nun bound us together
have dissolved; with them has gone our
populism, our confidence, our idealism.
Capturing student government last year
was not very difficult; she seemed to
want to be seduced. Since the explosion
of the military recluitmenl issue last
spring, it has been clear that student
government will be disowned before she
is misused to lead the revolution. With-
drawzl of the Grinnell lell (such as it is)
from politics is not simply a dissatisfac-
tion with the channels of the “system."
It is an admission of deleat in the effort
to move student opinion.

Now, why no Knight? It would be
easy to say, son, is an instrument or
motion; those committed to stasis are
excluded. The righteous indignation of
students over Senate opposition to Mal‘me/
recruiting, support of Richard Schncil‘ov
belore the jud‘cihl council, and support
of the Playboy demonstrators have not
created a united rightist backlash. In-
stead we have live candidates with little
hope and no energy. This death-wish may
be what representative student gavem—
ment on zhls campus means. An election
with neither thought nor action will be a
ruling tllneral.

Play Questioned

Lust week-end the Grinnell
community was given a special
treat: a protessional periorni-
ance ot a poor obscure Greek
play, At this point, i leave the
review to the critics and ques-
tion the decision to produce the
play in the iii-st place as well
as the so-caued “casting."

Our theatre department seems
to have lost any incentive to
produce plays that will be or
educative value or simply iii-
teresting to either the actors or
the audience. Our connections
with Peter Amot and the Mil-
wankec Repertory are both'cx—
citing. but it seems that there
is no conceivable excuse [or the
absorption or drama tunds tor
then-.nse. The second semester
budget allows for two major pro~
ductiolls. We have seen one—
tllr other will be a musical late
in the semester (which will not
be ahie to involve all serious
drama students, who are leit
to lawrbudget one-acts in the
Arena). l will admit you can

. learn ei great deal by watching
protessioiials, but when will stu-
dents have a chance to apply
what they've learned? The ques-
tion is not “a good perionnance
by prolessiollals” or “a bad per-
torniaiice by students." We have
had the worst: an inelfectual
production by pmiessionals that
deprived students or the right
to demonstrate their talents for
the criticism and enjoyment or
the college community. Again,
we have a classic example or
this college trying to suppress
student spontaneity, and under.
mining confidence in students'
desire to learn by doing.

l think the drama department
owes it students ol the perform-
ing art. more than a token ac-
knowledgement Give the one
act: to the pros and let the stu-
dents use the resources set up
for their use.

The discussion between Stu-

Sunday night leit the cold. it is
one thing to negatively and
rather maliciously deplore Grin

witheringly put i the Grinnell

other to positively and seriously
sit down with protessurs and
other students in your discipline
or related disciplines and a"
cuss workable means of prov‘
ing the most variety and in .
vidiial creativity within the
curriculum. 1 repeat “the most
variety and individual creativ-
ity" because sortie students so
often tail to acknowledge the
time limits oi protessors (espe-
cially good proiessors) not to
mention money and department

the number of new educational
possibilities. Negativism win-
out a positive and sincere de—

like to reply to all of them, as
I disagree with almost all at
them, but for lack Di space I

House one week after the dim-
otistrution at which the demon-
strators attempted and i be-
lieve succeeded, in showing
other people why they felt their
action was necessary. 1 also
wonder it Mr. Gray has ever
tallied personally with those
who took part in the demonstra-
tion. It so, i give my apologies
to Mr. Gray, but i sincerely
doubt that such is the case. I
believe [his lack of any attempt
to comprehend the reasons for
such an action, one wlllcli goes
against almost all prevailing so
cietal values, is nothing less
than tragic,

Most members or society look
at what happens. not why, and
they make no attempt to under-

man beings It is this attempt
at understanding that has to

collcemed with human values,
as opposed to the concern now
with objects, money, and power.

she was sick or being treated
as less than a human being and

and a great crescendo of sound
and fury signifying little.

First of all, I’d like to say in

, passing that the Alumni Recita-

tion Hall was quite appropriate-
ly named. it is a recitation
hall, and not a theater. The dis-
tractions inherent in the physi-
cal layout of the hall are such
that any production mounted
there is immediately in trouble
All three productions given
there in the past two years
have suffered from slamming
doors and the impossibility of
masking an unavoidably unat-
tractive stage, The balcony is
too high and too close, and the
absence of wings and entrances
makes eftective blocking most
difﬁcult

Fascination with Effect

The set immediately remind-
ed me or Gulliver's flying island
of Laputa. Throughout the proa
duction I wondered whether the
action was taking place ’aboard
a ship or on dry land. The rake
of the stage seemed uncom-
fortably steep, and provided not
only problems of blocking but
also the possibility that one
false step would have meant a
tumble into the laps of those
sitting in the front row of seats,

The set seemed to be a vague
Intellectual conception which

‘had little relation to what was

happening dramatically, The
same can be said, I Lhink, of
the lights, music. and costumes,
While the initial effect of the
lights was very exciting, Cun<

against Troy. They were not
"dressed like Greeks." and
when Philoctetes says they are,
it is apparent that plausibility
has been sacriﬁced to effect
Plausihilty sacriﬁced in Acting

I think plausibility was also
sacrificed in the performance
given by Peter Arnot in the
title role. Mr. Arnot’s exagger-
ated declamatory style, so ela-
quent in his puppet shows,
tended to become pure rant, to
[use its effectiveness, and final-
ly to become hollow and tedious
in a production with real people.
Mrs Arnot seemed to be more
concerned with his technical
virtuosity than with the prob-
lem of presenting a believable
character. I couldn’t believe
his anguish, i couldn‘t sympa—
mice with his predicament, I
couldn‘t Jindersland his con-
ﬂict, and I finally wished some-
one would drop him overboard.
I think a little more communi-
cation with his fellow actors
would have made Mr, Amol’s
performance much more en-
joyable.

with his conscience was per-

was that Miss Reed was ob-

her character “real,” however.

Robert: lngham’s performance
often lacked the strength neces~

the greater responsibility for
this inconsistency of character-b ,

fact that Odysseus came across
as a mischievous prankster in-

from both the dramatic irony
and the effectiveness of the

legality and Moraliy: The issue of Disroliing Analyzed

By NEAL MILNER

Asslslant Prof. of Political Science

Discussions conceming the recent
campus disrobing incident usually locus
upon the motives of the actors involved.
The students are accused of being public.
lty-hungry, the attorney general is in-
dicted for his alleged desire for political
gain, and the local prosecutor is accused
of a weaki-kneed capitulation to political

ressuie. 0n the basis of such discus
sions it is easy to lapse into ad hominum
arguments about these participants. (In-
deed, is certain local cement mixer
whose humor reflects all the subtlety of
an amplified Bronx cheer, has developed
this ad hominum approach into a finely
honed, if monotonously and awkwardly
used method.)-Thess rather parochial
discussions fail to consider some of the
most important aspects of the issue, Two
questions are particularly nppropziato
and interesting, First, what makes the
issue so perplexing to the public? Second,
why is the settlement of the issue seem-
ingly so dependent upon the legal pro«
cess?

A common response. to the first ques<
tion might very well be, “Only an aca<
demicion could ask such a questionl
The reason is simply that people don’t
like students running around without
their clothes on." I suggest that the is-
sue is a more complex issue which is
related to some basic social and politi-
cal characteristics of American society.
Public opinion surveys quite conclusively
show that very few Americans have any-
thing close to a well deﬁned, well de-
veloped political ideology. Nonetheless,
most of us manifest some kind of basic
and quite stable core oi perceptions and
attitudes which we use to interpret ihe
world around us. The dismbing incident

is particularly perplexing to the public
because if is especially difficult to place
Within this world view. The cues the
incident generates are not easily related
to our traditional core of political atti-
tudes and behavior.

The Grinnell issues are not easily re-
lated to the more common campus oc-
currences which are usually associated
with the “politics of confrontation.” No
buildings were damaged, no papers were
destroyed, and indeed no ultimatums
were made. Given the political context
of the last few years, American society
is probably better able to comprehend
(but not, i emphasize, necessarily ap-
prove of) these more violent acts than.
it is able to comprehend the nature and
goals of disrobing. Out of necessity this
society has been required to cope with a
great deal of violence during the past
few years, I am not arguing that these
experiences have created a greater legi-
timacy for violent acts, I am only ar-
guing that, regardless of his attitudes to-
wards the disrobing, an individual can
more easily reldte Violence to his world
view than he can relate public nudity.

Furthermore, the disrobing becomes
more perplexllig because of Ihe diffi-
culty of viewing it in terms of tradi-
tional religious values. Here again I do
not say that this confusion itself neces-
sarily creates greater approval or disap-
proval, The disiobing gdds a variation to
a typical and traditional problem which
Julieta—Christian religions face. Tradi-
tionally, the church has faced a con-
flict over whether to stress physical over
spiritual amelioration of the unfortunate.
A Hasidic aphorism nicely summarizes
the usual two positions in this conflict.
“Don't worry so much about my soul and
your body. Worry about my body and

your soul." The disrobing incident ls cou-
fusing because it forces society to con-
sider a moral question in a manner con-
cerned with amelioration of the body in
the traditional sense of seeking protection

or sustenance for it. On the other hand,
they were quite explicitly telling society
not to worry about the actual physical
appearance of the body. These are
two uncommon and rather sophisticated
ideas, and it is little wonder that the
stated aims of the nude protesters are
constantly misunderstood. (Certainly the
media has made little attempt to make
these issues any more comprehensible.)

Why, then, does society attempt to
solve such a particularly perplexing mor-
al issue by means of the legal process?
The sociologist William Chambllss Sug-
gests that “the legal process must be
understood as taking the form that it does
because of the characteristics of the SO-
cial system which are independent of,
and which render relatively inconse<
quential, the motives. character, or per
sonality of the particular people who oc-
cupy positions in the system.” Such par-
ticipants are only a part of the larger
social structure to be resolved by means
of the nature of the Conflicts to be re-
solved by means or the legal process and
to a lesser extent, the sanctions to be
implemented. In American satiety we
oltcn turn to the legal process as a
means of settling moral issues. Recent
opinion surveys show that the indivi-
dual American most commonly claims
that crime is caused by moral break-
down. They also show that paradoxtcally
the individual American commonly ex-
pects that traditional government legal
sanctions will correct moral inad-
equacies. In fact. Daniel Bell contends

that, despite glaring failures, “in no
other country have there been such
spectacular attempts to curb human
appetites and brand them illicit.“ Since
the disrobing inCldent involves some 50-
pliisticated moral issues, and since we
often tiy to resolve these issues through
the political-legal process, it should not
be too surprising that participants in the
legal process are involved. individual
motivations thus explain only a pan of
the story.

My purpose here is not to suggest
solutions but merely to consider the im.
pact of the disrobing incident. However,
1 would like to point out two problems
which often evolve from any attempt to
resolve such’ moral issues by means of
legal process. First, lt is all too easy to
define the morally of the powerful as the
customary, acceptable moral behavror.
Such a definition could be particularly
costly to a pluralistic society. Second.
the frustrations which develop from art
attempt to enforce laws based on legal
moralism- can often lead to a dangerous
impatience with the tenets of due pro-
cess.

Pollsters Examine

By
KATHY BULL and MOLLY MCGUIRE

After the “give ’em hell” SGA mesh
dential candidates‘ speeches on Monday
night we undertook to listen to the
voices-of the overwhelmed students.
Freshmen Carol Sigmund and Jim Bel<
move and sophomore John Gardner.
were spotted just inside or ARl-l. Miss
Sigmand’s political stance is in the
middle of the (straight and narrow?)
road. She calls for vigorous pursuit of a
responsible, moderate (not antagonistic
but wishy»washy), capable of compro«
mise, approach to student government.
She berales Mark Allen for his claim
that studenis should not have a hand
(or foot), even, in academic decisions.
This year Miss Sigmond’s vote will go
to either Jamie Trotter or John Herr
because she likes the issues they didn’t
raise and the solutions they didn’t pro-
pose. She was impressed by their sug-
gested comprehensives, bookstore coop.
and interdisciplinary studies programs.
“The problem is not the system but the
people. Thirteen members could not be
more or less democratic than forty.”

Jim Bellilove is throwlng up his sup-
]Jprt (0 Jim Lew. “I didn't think I'd like
anyone when I came to hear the
speeches, but I liked Jim's idea of mak-
ing the campus more friendly. Different
factions on campus don’t know how to
talk to each other and don't understand
each other,"

John Gardner liked John Herr's “gen-
eral tendency toward unification of the
student body." Student. bodies should be
imifiedi (Remember Tom Thomas'
“warm body approach") Gardner said
that he liked many measures of the
Thomas regime, and he thinks that it’s

Election Attitudes

important to vote to elect someone who
expressed his own views with as much
clarity and conviction and vaseline as
Tom has,

In the warm and lively atmosphere of
the Forum, Phil Sampson and Roger
Doenker were buttonholed, These two
fault the courave so typical of Grinnell,

to disagree. These hardy souls dared to
question the worth of the office of SGA
presidency. Mr. Koenket feels that it is
indeed worthwhile ii there is someone
competent to make decisions. The qual-
lty of the,oillce, he conjectures, is de-
termined by the people who fill it, Mr.
Sampson,~dissenting, thinks that the of-
fice is too powcrtul, hilt does not feel
an attempt at decentralization would be
successful. Their choice of candidate
was the Grim Reaper, by acclamation.
Their reasoning was that he “comes
closest to your heart and head, dresses
most stylishly, was the least deathly of
the five, and has the courage to lie down
and Say what he thinks.” They con<
curred on the idea that the Strident gov-
emment needs people who are not afraid
to say what they think, to stir things up,
to be so bad as to incite a riot, and to
give rebirth to the student government.
"People are going to have to quit play-
ing this game and start playing their
own. If enough students want a student
government there should be one, if not,
there shouldn't” Mr. Sampson suggested
that there be a general senate, including
elected student, faculty and administra-
tion representatives. At this point Tom
Thomas ambled over, and “the Old
Guard" discussed the distinct decline in
political fervor from last year.

Also found drinking in this convivial

setting was Bill Thomas. In response to
the battery of incisive questions, Thomas
quickly formulated his two thoughts and
shot back, ”The conservatives don’t
seem to be Very articulate and intelli.
gent. which is reasonable. We need some-
one to maintain diversity and keep things
petty. He wouldn’t have to be elected,
just run.” Thomas felt that the office of
son president does not have any inhei.
ent importance except in financial mat-
ters (providing funds for beer blasts
etc); the importance is dependent on
the specific events that may occur and
his response to them, and the represen.
tative image he portrays to the World.
Thomas holds that specific ideas are

less important than personality in this
race for office. He sums up by saying
something that has been festering inside
all of us for too long. “What this College
needs is more nepotism.”

Having finally roved to the Youiikei-
study room, we came upon Tom Merrill,
sophomore, quenching his voracious
thirst for knowledge. His full written
text follows:

"I'm for Jamie Trotter. From the
opening speeches it appears that, tir’st,
a kilid of conservative reaction has set
in with the student body — the emphasis
was on reconciliation and a “happy
community” rather than on confronta-
tion, and revolutionary change. Secondly
there was a rather strong resentment
expressed toward what was described

‘as an elites: SGA, Jamie Trotter dem<

onstraicd a painful sincerity and de-
termined naivete that is perfect for im-
plemenling a quixotic program along
these lines. He was also refreshingly un-
hip, sort of low»camp in his own right.
An enthusiastic high school approach in
just what Grinnell needs."

Objections Overruled;
SA System Unchanged

Aiter careful inquiry, the student at-
ialrs committee passed a resolution con-
cerning the Student Advisor system. it

recommended iirst that the program be

budget by an advisory board composed
of two student advisors, two students. Mr.
Haas, Mr, Obermiller, Mrs. Low. and
one assistant dean.

it further emphasized that student ad-
viser-s are Counselors. not drseiplinarians.
and that this should be made clear both
to the student advisors and t0 the resi-
dents oi their halls. The committee
voted 473 to retain the present salary oi
3203 per year. Early next year. it plans to
conduct a more thorough evaluation and
review oi the program's control. salaries,
etc.

This action is the result oi a much
broader proposal in.tiated by the three
student members or the committee. The
original plan called for separation oi the
advisor program from its present ties to
the Dean's Ofﬁce. The students asked lor
an autonomous program, directed by a
governing board similar to the advi ry
board outlined above. The committee,
however, felt that the success or the ad-
visory group at this time was dependent
upon maintaining essentially the same
format.

The three representatives of SGA. Tom
Thomas, Heather Foote, and Lee Maul,
also clashed with the other members or
the committee on the question .0!
salaries. The students had asked that
salaries be abolished. Again using the
rationale that it was necessary to main-
tain the status quo one more year. the
committee decided against the change.
The students then opted for a compro-
mist or cutting the salaries to 5100. thus
nosing $7,000. It was also proposed that
the committee recommend that these
iunds be redirected, in part. to iiirance an
extended speakers program related to
the student advisors’ training, Mrs. Low
stated that she ielt this unwise, as there
could be no absolute guarantee that
such funds would be used as the commit-
tee wished.

Tom Thomas, SGA President. com-
mented that he ielt “the committee has
only postponed a decision that must
again be considered using little more in-
iormation than is presently available."
Though somewhat disappointed with the
resultant recommendation, Thomas add<

nanranu had completely disrobed, De~
sense Attorney Johnston made the mo«
tiou that the information against her I)!
dismissed.

Johnston also made a separate motion
that the charges he dismissed against
all (our defendants since the testimony
of all the witnesses indicated only that
there was nudity, and not “indecency."
Johnston said that the “statute does not
punish disrobing, and does not punish
nudity.” He emphasized that no evidence
or any obscene or lewd actions had been
presented at the hearing.

in reply to Johnston's second motion
Justice 0! the Peace Lincoln Said. “the
court will not rule on what is lewd and
obscene." He then overruled the motion,
Concerning Miss Hermann, he ruled that
“because no evidence was brought up
that could be classed as indecent exA
posure.” the charges against her would
be dismissed. He then said that he would
refer the case to district court, and re
lease the deiendants on their own recog-
nizanee. No date has been set {or the
trial at District Court.

attendance at the campaign speeches
given in halls.

\ The tour candidates presently in the
race. which began on Fri. Feb. 21. are
John Herr, Jim Lew, Keith Petersen. and
Mark Allen. Candidates gave their pro
posals in campaign speeches presented
to an audience oi about i50 students in
ARI-I Monday night.

A few differing areas of major con-
cern have made themselves felt in each
candidate‘s platiorm. Jamie Trotter. who
withdrew from the race on Wednesday,
began his campaign-with the ideal or
"the creation of an academic atmos—
phere." John Herr and Jim Lew both
stressed proposals ior increasing the
communication between student govern-
ment and the student body. Mark Clit-
ford Allen defined the role of student
government to exclude curricular reiorm
and social pressure: “it is not to pass
resolutions and sit around as a 2nd late
debating society, but to iiod people. put
them on committees and make sure the
committees work."

Jamie Trotter. who withdrew “be-

. cause I am interested ill a different

system through which to channel my
efforts", gave his support to Jim Lew,
who has also stressed the idea that stu-
dent government should have a voice in
curricularutialrs. In meetings in the
halls. Lew suggested that students have
a legitimate right to question iaculty de-
cisions on certain mallers, such as tho
tiring oi proiessors.

Glose Loss In
Record Breaker

Sweet Victory eluded the
Gl‘innell Swimming last week
end in their penultimate meet
or the year as they lost to Cora
nell 49 to 46. Competition was
highlighted by school or pool
records set in {our of the eleven
events, and by unusually stilt
competition in the diving, where
the last place diver scored 195
points and the first three all
scored over 200. Grinnell’s rec—
ord is now live wins and three
losses in conference competi~
tion.

Records were also broken in
ireshinan competition. John
Wein’s 2: 11.7 in the 200 butterfly
is a freshman school record and
is under the freshman conterence
record; Steve Ward’s 1241.0 in
the 160 individual medley bet-
ters the varsity and ileshmall
school record; and the 400 flee
relay team of Ward, Weins,
Cams, and Daley swam a 3:218
which is faster than the fresh-
man school, pool, and confer-
ence record, and equals the
varsity conierence record.

On February 28, the varsity

Frosh Show Promise

At a dual meet against U.N.l.
on Thursday, Grinnell’s fresh~
men indoor-track Learn showed
that they would be the team to
reason with in the coming con»
iercnce meet on March 7, in
Chicago. With no iield men, and
their best sprinter disqualihed,
they managed to score 37 points
to U.N.I.'s so, a team with
depth.

Good individual performances
were turned in by Morales who
won the mile in 4:343 and the
hall mile in 2:07. McGrnth
placed first in the two mile with
the reasonable time or 53:44.7,
and Pil'olli won the high jump.

The battle was closely fought

Blades Score
First Victory

Grinnell's Blades, sparked by
Jeff Mlllikin’s “Hat Trick,"
scored their first victory of the
season last Friday night, as
over Des Moines omaarber

Plaza.

Student-Coach Mike Schaifer
said Jeff was “quite impres-
sive” and played the best game
that he had ever seen the husky

lineman play. Dave Riihe,.

Bruce Graham and Tom Jack-
son added the other tallies.

The Blades were tied 7-7 a
week earlier by this same Des
Muiiies squad. “The real key to
the game was the deiensive
play,” noted coach Schaﬂer.
“We held them to 30 shots while
ﬁring 48 at their goal.”

The Crowd oi nearly 50 spec—
tators got top-rate, “pro-style"
hockey, including a stick and
ﬁst fight which almost got out
of hand and was somewhat ex-
tended after the contest.

Grinnell dropped a e3 deci-
sion the following alternoon to
Graceland on Barber, Again de-
iense was the key, but the situ-
ation was reversed. In spite of
the almost even shooting, 33 for
Grinnell and 31 shots for Grace
land, the Blade defense tailed
to pick up their front lineman
consistently, allowing a Lon-1
confrontation. Blade goals were
picked up by Millikin, Graham,
and Mike Schaii'er.

Tile Blades will carry a 1-10-3
record into their iinnl Sunday
against the Des Moines Ice
Hawks. In two earlier bouts, the
Blades lost 2~1 and (led 2-2. The
game will start at ll in me
Des Moines Ice Alena.

Every year, a certain number
of Sporting events are given the
added lustre of pitting two un-
deieated teams against each
other. This was the case with
Notre Dame - Michigan state
in 1966, Houston - UCLA in
1968, and Dibble ~ OffrCampus
in 1969. The game was tight
throughout and an overtime pe-
riod was fought through beiore

Loose took an overtime victory
from East as Grant Crandall
scored 53 points to set a new

67 points in that victory. in the
“B" league, Cowles, Clark, and

There ‘are a number of 1. M.
sports still on the winter pros-
pectus, including wrestling,
and table tennis. Wrestling will
be somewhat more informal
this year since not enough people
expressed an interest in it to
merit a tournament. Perhaps
I. M. degenerating could be
substituted with class lines de-

termining the divisions (i. e.
senior slump, junior jag-pit.
sophomore slippage. and iresh-
man failing). It might be added
that this type or activity hu-
great co-ed appeal. In addition,

' the local emporiums oi good

cheer (which serve as the play-
ing aieas) could provide the or.
llcials (and some energy-sup.
plying elixir). It seems worth
an eliort since the weekend
promises to provide little oppor.

that just might be because or
our warped perspective. As a
former grad once said, "Grill-

Art Colloquium
Censures Dept.

By JONATHAN STEIN

The Gllnnell art department is not as

ood as it could be. it is under-staffed.
glhkil‘fg it Impossible for nonrmajors to
take courses, and it is di icult for majors
to pursue their education. The depart-
ment lacks scope in the introductory as
well as advanced courses. In the case
of a leave of absence, there is no effort
(trade to hire a temporary replacement.

t the introductory level, the depart-
nent sometimes assigns a man quali-
led only for studio instruction to an art

istory class. As a result, the quality of
instruction is poor in the course, and he
is unable to teach a studio course for
which he is qualified. Art majors are not
‘nly limited by the courses, but also by
‘he eight credit restriction on indepen
dent study.

With’these problems in mind. the art
majors held a colloquium last week—
pnd to organize themselves and make
suggestions on how to improve the de-

artment.

r The colloquium recommended the ad-
illtion of two new staff members, one in
art; history and one ill the studio in-
junction.

They all decided to circulate a ques
tionnaire in hopes of determining how
bunny “non-majors" have been unable to
take courses and workshops. The majors
will be asked to put down in writing the
courses they feel are necessary for their
education.

The colloquim also decided to go to
Chicago on April 4—7 where they will
yisit Chicago art schools and museums,
‘the majors are also trying to make ar-
rangements for an underground film
series. The main obstacle to both the trip
and the movies is money; as the art de-
partment's budget does not provide
enough money for extracurricular acti-
vities. The money will have to come from
the students.

As a result of my article on the need
for nude models, the majors have locat-
pd a Zlayearsold, married, lion-student
lwith modeling experience. willing to
inodel for a reasonable fee. The students
gow hope to convince the department and
‘ e administration that nude models are
n necessity for serious art students.

NSA to Oppose
End of 1/2 Fare

Recently there has been a great deal
of consternation on campus concerning
the proposed abolition of standby fares.
The 5&3 contacted United Airlines and
learned that stand-by rates still exist.
The airlines also assured us that they
will extensively publicize any changes.

The National Student Association is
protecting student interests in this mat-
ter. NSA has retained legal counsel to
oppose the recommendation of a CiVil
Aeronautics Board examiner that youth
fares are “unjustly discriminatory.”
Arthur S. Present, the CAB examiner
reasons: ”Although youth fare rates are
available to everyone in the specified
age groups, this attribute does not excuse
the discrimination unless age is a prop-
er foundation for that discrimination."
no maintains that ”the rule or equality is
paramount." Lawyers representing NSA
will prepare briefs and oral arguments
for presentation before the CAB, The
NSA will support youth fares by citing
the educational, social, economic, and
cultural benefits gainedr

m

loquium's suggestions will affect the art
department. If the department is not
improved, serious majors will be unwill.

will not be interested in coming.

Liberals Organize

An organizational meeting for a new
liberal Democratic pressure group in
Iowa, the Iowa Democratic Conference
(IDC) was held in Grinnell Monday. The
Poweshiek County meeting was part of
a state-wide series of organizational
meetings in preparation for a conven-
tion to he held in Ames, Iowa on March
3.

Professor Alan Jones (History), chain
man of the county meeting, and eight
others out of thirty present at the
meeting, were selected to attend the
state convention.

The IDC is foreseen as a liberal pres
sure group within the state party. whose
purpose would be “to focus attention on
issues." It's purposes are, however, still

. very vague, and they should be more

clearly defined at the state convention.

The group, currently headed by Dan
Johnston of Des Moines, has been en-
dorsed by state party leaders including
former Lieutenant Governor Robert Ful<
ton, former State Treasurer and guberna-
torial candidate Paul Franzenburg, and
former 4th district Congressman Bert.
Bandstra. The DC is conceived of as a
group which will criticize the state party.
as well as work with it, although many
state leaders are not prepared to do this.
Generally, Iowa's Democratic Party is
progressive compared with other states';
thus, IDC liberals should be able to Work
very closely with the regular party.

The meeting in Ames will be open to
everyone; anyone who is ‘interested
should see Mr. Alan Jones or Mr. Ed
Moore.

”I'd hate to have students see some of
the very silly things we do in faculty
meetings," Professor Joseph Danforth
(Chemistry) told the 5&3 last week. “We
do some things we're ashamed of our-
selves when we're flnlshed.”

Danforth was one of five members of
the faculty's Executive Council who were
contacted by the 5&3 and asked to we
plain why students are excluded from
faculty meetings and to give their re—
action to a suggestion that students be
admitted to the meetings in a non-particl-
patory capacity.

Danforth said that the faculty isn't con<
cealing “great secrets" from the Stu-
dents, but he believes that students
should not be present at most faculty
meetings. although they should have ac¥
cess to the minutes. “i would personal-
ly be influenced by some of the students
I respect ii I knew they were observing,"
Danfonh explained. “With students there
we would put on a show and wouldn't be
our ornery selves."

Chairman of the Faculty Joseph Wall
(History) told the 5&3 that the question
of student admission to tacuity meetings
has never arisen before. “The meetings
have always been closed to students and
also to all administrators, except those
with academic rank,” Wall Said. Fresh
dent Leggett, rather than the Chairman
of the Faculty presides over faculty
meetings.

Wall believes that only voting members
of the faculty should be present at the
meetings. “1 would object to any specta-
tors, because I think it would change
the free nature of the debate," be ex-
plained.

P hilllp Kintner (History) also said
he would oppose the presence of students
at faculty meetings. He said that topics
discussed at faculty meetings range “all
over the map," and include curriculum.
student referrals and various academic
matters which might be of concern to
students, “However, having students pre-
sent would reduco the viability of diS‘
cussion." Kintner said, "Many things
that are discussed have to do with the
individuals present, and some things are
said that shouldn't be thrown out in
the open."

Professor Raymond Betts (History)
thinks if students were allowed to attend

faculty meetings, "the kind of free and
frank discussion that often occurs would
be inhibited,” However. Betta believe!
that, “Students needn't be excluded un-
qualifiedly on all occasions, and in
many instances student participation
wouldn‘t be out or order." He said that
students should not be present when the
faculty discusses certain “discreet" sub
jects. Asked to explain what he meant
by “discreet," Betts begged the question.

Professor Waldo Walker (Biology)
said that the faculty “discusses some
things that are personal problems that
don’t concern the students." He termed
the faculty’s closed-door policy towards
students as "sort of a tradition." Asked
if he would oppose admitting students to
faculty meetings, Walker replied, “i
guess it wouldn't hurt anything, but it
would limit faculty participation to some
degree." Asked Li a students stake in his
education didn't warrant his being pre«
sent at faculty meetings, walker com-
mented, “Well, I think most studEntl
would be bored."
