New Dillisional Organization Pldn TNew Ice Rink lGrelchen Hayes Vii-ews Prlze Piciures;
Advocaled By President Bottell

A new plan tor divisional or.
ganization oi the college has

been suggested to tho iaeulty.

by Prcidcnt Howard R Bowen
and is now awaiting the approv-
al of the trustees

Bowen‘s proposal is to estabr
lisli.a “general division” con»
sisting of the departments of hiss
tory, mathematics and philoso—
phy. These three departments
by the nature ot their subiccls.
have intimate relations with
many other departments.

Bowen said that only aminor
change in the divisional organi-
zation recommended by the

faculty would hive to be made.‘

This would involve movingr po-
litical sclent‘e and air ‘science
to the social studies division
Mathematics, would be moved
from the division of natural
sciences to the “general diviSr

is hoped that this general

on might become a

bridge-builder cantributinz t0 ‘

the unification of the rolle‘ze

and helping to counteract the ‘
tendency toward insulnritv in i

departmental‘ and divisional
organization.

In dealing with educational
policy, the general division
would be concerned not only
with its member departments.
but also with'the relations of
these departments to the entire
college.

The unifying ciiect which the
new di\ n would have on the
departments of the colleE-f: can
he seen as follows. In the di~
vision oi natural sciences. his-
tory would ,be concerned with
the history of science. mathe-
matics would stress mathematics

cm of architecture regardless

of expense and future pl'acllbllr
ity, it will need to adapt its
.rchltecture to changing needs
nd contemporary tot-ms, Grill-
ell is no exception, ‘

At present the old and the
new are in sharp contrast as
one walks about the campus and
ompares Burling library, Nor»

tine arts building to the older
tyles of architecture, most com-
monly. called “l‘evivztlist” since
they are patterned on a classic

Like all ionns of art there is
. iii-eat: deal of individual taste
.nd feeling in architecture, and
the fact that the newer buildings

.nd Merrill. architects of some
.istinction, is a primary factor.

The architectural influence
fou‘nd in, these buildings, as in
many oi the 5.0M. works, is
that of the Bauhaus or interna—
ional style. It was developed in
he post—World War 1 period
in Germany at Bauhaus and car.
ried during World War II to

The primary interest 'at Bau-
iaus was to torce -the architect

ndusti-ial designers. This results
d;in a more frank use of mar
terials in the most functional
vay possible.

‘ln these new buildings one
will notice the absence ot any
ttcmpt to hide the materials.
id in fact they have been used

the architecture in such a
vay as to become an integral
art of the bu'ilding’s beauty.

‘ The long concrete beams of
Roberts theatre might be said
to be analagous to the frills

A Tribute
Only strong willerl men are able to keep an ideal clear-
ly before them amid the pressures of modern society.
Such a man is Howard R. Bowen. The ideal is academic
freedom and the right to freedom of speech.

Not long ago Sigma Delta Chi, National Journalism
Fraternity for men presented President Bowen with an
award for “quietly- and consistently protecting the right
to freedom 01' speech on this campus and elsewhere.“

This paper joins in the SDX tribute L0 Dix Bowen,
whose clear thinking, and tolerance has been an inspi \-
tion to a “new Grinnell", and to students here and every-
where who are tr ‘ng to wrestle with the problems of
a confused world situation

Knamilier was voted the most
valuable player for the 1961
season; Miller was voted captain
of next-year's team. -

known by his teammates, had
a season that will be long re-
membered; he broke a total of
fire Grinneli baseball records
in three seasons of competition
.Knamiilcr got 19 hits in 49 times
at bat tins season for a batting
average of .388; both the batting
average and the number of hits
are new records.

Three career rccortk were
set by Kiminilier, including
most runs, 32 (breaking the
old re _rd oi zsl most hits. 43
tbrpa the old record by
three and beating teammate
Jim Lowry by one hit).

Both Lowry and Knamlller
stole a total of nine bases in
their three years here to break
the old career record by two.
Jack Fretcr, a sophomore. set
the siugle'seasoii mark in that
department with it in one year.|

Knaniiiler, third baseman and
unolllclal field general. led the,
Pioneers to their best seasoni
since 19l2 with eight victories.
SIX defeats and one lie. ln alll
a total of 14 records were setl
this season; modern records at:
Grinnell date book only to 1957
when baseball returned to Grind
neii alter a 40 year Intervention:

Freter set the record for i
most runs scored in one sea—
son with 15. while Dick Mite
telbusher tied the record set
last year by Jack Mcyor for
most wins in, one season for
a pitcher with four.

Meyer set a total of five marks
himself in the pitching tlcpart—
merit They wei most strike-
outs in one se n, so; most,
wal s in one season, 33; most
wins in a pitcher's career. 9:

Meyer was captain of the souadj
this season. i

Coach Pfitseh will lose on
four members from this yea
squad. Lowry. Knamiller. Mey—
er and Ron Ochsner. ln summariz-
ing the season, Pittsch felt that
the 5-6 record isn't a true re-
presentation of how well Grin-
ncll played. He pointed out that
when Grinncll won, they won
by the average margin of 51
runs; when they lost it was by_
a 2d margin.
or the six loses, three were
by one run and two by only two
runs, He also added that the
team batting average was a
creditable .2 3, and the slugging
average was .309. .

Grinnell provided more student
recreation in the past year than
ever before. due largely to the
efforts of Coach Ii-v Simone and
the physical education depart.
ment

Working with lunited funds,
two college station wagons and
an old school bus rcehristcncd
"The Covered Wagon" no cnten
tainment become out of the ques-
tion for Grinnelhans As Simone
pointed out, “All you need is the
ideas — our dep nt wlll’see
to it that you ha a the tneans if
the activity is worthwhile."

Shopping, theater performances
and sporting events in nearby
large cities became the ohjects of
trips by various groups.

Winter sports were emphasized
with a well-rounded program in.
cluding ice skating, ice fishing
and skiing. A rink was impro-

ivised next to Darby Gymnasium

which provided for both hockey
pleasure skating complete

ends.

ice fishing was offered as a
recreational pastime on the near—
by Rock Creek Lake.

The skiing program was one
of the most rewarding. Visits to
local slopes took place weekly'
and, as interest gained, longer
jannts were arranged to Wis-
consin and Colorado over se-

l master break and Spring vac:—

tion.

In the spring canoeing and sail-
boating were offered. The cane '-
lng program was particularly
successful. It offered a soemile
m‘el'lllght trip tor 2.: students
every week-end on the Iowa
River. A total of Hit students
took advni age of the opportunity
to paddle and camp out

The program is still gathcring
momentum. with bigger and beta

Grinneil‘s past basketball sear

dividing it into two phases; the

Coach Plitsch cited a number
of reasons for the Pionccrs' poor

boys had just completed the foot.
ball season and weren't “basket-
ballized" yet. Cupiain' Jim
Lowry was bothered by an in.
jury sustained late in the grid
season.

The squad ,played together
well as a team but lacked spir—
it; individually they were very
mediocre nnd unpolished, with
the exception of Bob Musser,
who played some of his best
games in 1960.
