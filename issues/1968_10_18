SAGA Help Cries

A group oi SAGA workers met
Thursday, October 10, to discuss
their grievances. Some of the
workers at Quad dining hall are
unhappy about the wage poli-
cies oi SAGA. Recently, SAGA,
to economize, cut down on time
allotments ior some jobs and
the number of workers on some
jobs. The unrest is present, but
the workers are as yet not uni-
ﬂed.

The group is considering ask-
ing tor a wage increase. This is
viewed unfavorably by the
Deans, who ieel it would lead
to a higher board fee and
would prompt other College
workers to ask for a wage in—
crease.

The group plans to talk to
SAGA Chuck Hand and Gary
Shaw. Future action depends
upon the outcome of these
talks.

Social Studies Grade Called
“Experiment on Experiment”

By BENSON SMITH

An appeal to the faculty at
large to use credit-fail grading
for Social Studies was passed
by a narrow margin. The deci-
sion applies only to the iirst
semester and only to this year.
According to Bernard Mergen,
Social Studies Department
Chairman, the
impetus for
the proposal
came 1 r D m
the staff. Only
eight of the 13 staff members,
however, were originally in fa-
vor of the suggestion. The pro-
posal was written up by Robert
Voertman (Social Studies Divi-
sion Chairman), Gary Cagie
(Philosophy). and Gregory
Guroii (History).

The resolution refers to the
course as experimental. Guroff
said “the objectives of the
course are not quite clear,"
and “there was a general feel-
liig that hints that what they
were trying to do was ham-
pered by grades." Tile resolu-
lion states that “standards {or
evaluation or performance is an
undeSlrable constraint on ex-
perimentation" and that “set-
ting standards should be treated
as a sequal to more basic as-
pects of the experimentation."

What we are trying to do,
said Guroii, is to get students

News
Analysis

to investigate areas on their
own and to bring up relevant
questions. With a grading sys-
tem. he Continued, “students
typically try to come in and
figure out where a proi stands.
and then to follow that rather.
than find out where he (the
student) stands." According to
the resolution, “We can learn
more about what students may
learn from these materials if
we reduce their concern to
have us (the faculty) specify
what they should be learning in
order to score"

The fact that the request to
change to credit-fail came after
the semester was underway is
explained by the fact that
“eight of the thirteen members
of the staff were not involved
in planning or discussing the
course prior to the start ot the
Semester." Gurnff added that
many members or the stair
were not quite sure how to
handle the material. This is nut:
surprising considering that over
half of the staff did not partici-
pate in planning the Course.
This is perhaps accidentally
beneficial. Because the staff is
uniamilial’ with the material,
the opportunity for initiative on
the part of the students is
greater. when the instructorl

Travel Industry Provides Varied
. l Services & Prices for Students

By JOHN GARDNER

Student off-campus travel varies from a mid-semester trip to
thicago to a year spent abroad. This travel, in all its forms, has
iven rise to profitable industries which Cater to student travelers.

, hey provide published rates and programs for a variety of trips.
They give information to students as to how to save money
and how to visit parts of countries not usually looked for by
tourists. Thus the services of this type oi: travel agency may
range from a carefully organized Mediterranmn Cruise to a pro-
yam for part-time work and part-time study in Madrid. Students
affected represent 3% of the student population, in contrast with
tho 3% of the adult population which travels to Europe yearly.

U.S. Travel

The airline domestic fares in the United States generally in-
clude the standby youth tare for those in the 12 to 22 age bracket.
In this plan, a student pays only half fare for a one-way ticket
ror any seat which is unclaimed at boarding time. in view or the
tncreased numbers of regular travelers, some airlines do not have
standby rates at certain times of the year, such as Christmas,

when many people travel.
. Braniff, Delta, and Eastern Airlines now have a reserved
uth rare. For‘two-thirds or the regular price of a seat any person
izo to 22, and those in the military, may reserve a seat. A round-
trip excursion called the “Discover America” allows travelers to
pay 1/, return fare. The alrlines’ youth and "Discover America"
[area do have is few restrictions, such as a time limitation for
return, and they do not include [lights leaving on Friday evenings.

i Europa

‘ “It's cheap, because there‘s no entry fee to the Luxembourg alr-
pcrt. The food's bad, and the accomodations are lousy,” says
David Ruhe (’71) about the [light irorn New York to Luxembourg
on one of the least expensive transatlantic airlines, Icelandic
'Airlines. The round-trip costs $389 in the summer season and $319
in the winter season.

Bahamas Airways is a new competitor for low rates; Nas-
laurLuxembourngassau costs was all year long.

There are certain group rates and charter rates on overseas
lravel which sometimes are very low for individuals, Often in-
cluded is a sum oi money inr tour arrangements (such as train
trips into the country, guide expenses). To charter a plane an
organization must have lower than a certain number or members.
For example, the National Student Association, which has hundreds
of thousands of members is exempt, but Grinnell College, with
only two thousand members, would be eligible. A Charter load on a
jet is 150-180 persons, and a group can be [mm 14 persons on.

Ship Travel

Ship travel tends to be more expensive than plane travel. A
Iypical one way tare begins at 5275 on regular passenger lines.
Many people travel by sea because or the greater opportunities
to meet people while traveling. This seems to be a less attractive
Ieliing point to students than to nonrstudenrs, however.

In the summertime, there are usually several low Cost ships
traveling the Atlantic with fares as low 88 $170 to $200 for the
one way journey. Another low cost way to travel by sea is by
rreighter. They take no more than 12 passengers, and space i!
ditiicult to get, even as much as one year in advance.

programs
A February 1968 list of organizations specializing in student

travel lists 150 entries. Some, such as the American Institute lor
Foreign Study, are planned for the whole year and include special
Itudy arrangements, cholce or professors and courses, housing,
extra-curricular actwtties, and so on. Others last for the summer
or tor a few weeks during the summer. Together with organiza-
lions that provide educational and work arrangements, organiza«
tions such as American Youth Hostel cater to the student market
with very low-Cost accommodations.

in the next article, a Crosséection of some of these organiza<
lions will be studied: how they work and what services they can

Sachs & Tinker Push Home Rule

Bonnie Tinker, ’69, member
of the Council of Thirteen and

adviser to Richard Schneirov in'

the recent
charges of

open hearing on
illegal visitation,

called a meetingot students in— '

terested in discussing the case
for Thursday evening, October
10, at 7:30 pm. in South
Lounge. Joshua Sachs, '71, and
Miss Tinker presided over the
meeting. Plans for the meeting
were the result of a previous
meeting by some students held
Tuesday, October 9, the evening
after the hearing. About 40
students attended the Thursday
meeting,

Sachs and Miss Tinker sum-
marized previous events as
preparation for the topic or the
evening, discussion of the prin-
ciples of "self-determination”
and "home rule" for individual
halls, Miss Tinker stressed that
the meeting was in accord with
a student Senate resolution,
passed the previous evening,
recommending that ways be
round to begin discussions on
the idea of “home rule.”

According to Miss Tinker,
the Thursday meeting was not:
an attempt to bypass present
discussion going on through
"established channels" or the
student Affairs Committee, but
was intended to encourage in-
dependent discllssion of what
attitudes exist in the halls on
the issues of coeducational use
of hall rooms and the choices
imposed by the principle or self-
determination.

Thomas J. Thomas, ’70, made
the following comment on Miss
Tinker's motion: “A lot of it
boils down to how persuasive a
selling job you can do in the
Forum with a prof." .

A consensus of those at the
meeting seemed to indicate that
more people believed in the
possible success of experimen-
tation in “self-determination"
tor halls, and floors, than in
passing a mandatory rule for
24-hour opens.

Five persons volunteered to
lerve on a Committee, known
as the Ad Hoc Student Commie
tee tor Dorm Changes, to
write a proposal based on “self-
determination." The committee
members are Joshua Sachs.

chairman; Bruce Nissen, ‘70,
Lucy Blount, ‘71, Barbara Dev-
ereux, '72. and John Gardner.
’71. Sachs said of the commits
tee’s lunction, "We want to
come up with as much objective
information as possible about
the potentials and problems in
different dorms. What we want
to do is to issue a thorough
report on hall self-determina-
tion. We deﬁnitely encourage
people to come to our hearings
or contact members or the ad
hoc committee.” The first
meeting of the committee was
planned for 4 pm. Monday, 0c-
tober 14, in the South Lounge.

A number of students VOIUTIF
teered to discuss the idea of
“self-determination" in the
halls; hall meetings on the
subject were recommended for
October 14 and 15.

chased with funds made avail-
able by a private toundatlon.
"It has all of the characteris
tics necessary to serve the
teaching interests of four of the

bilities not only in courses for
general students and biology
majors, but also for indepen<

One of the outstanding lea-
iures of the tract is the diver-
sity oi habitat. There are com
(lguous areas or woodland,
grassland, marsh or bottomland,
and terrain Suitable for the con-
struction of small ponds. Plan:
for the field preserve and labor-

PROPOSED WOMEN'S GYMNASIUM

Through the generosity of
Miss Carrie Rand, the women's
gymnasium. which has been
planned for some time. will be
built the coming season. A
considerable sum had already
been raised for this purpose,
but not enough had been
pledged to assure the building,
and Miss Rand Voluntarily
pledged the entire sum neces-
sary, stipulating only that she
be permitted to name the build-
ing “The E. D. Rand Gymna-

sium," as a memorial to her,

father and brother, who bore
the same name.

The plans will undoubtedly
follow those drawn up three
years ago by Mr. H. K. Hois-

Wilson Wins In
Student Ballot

Women's Votes Loses

Woodrow Wilson. Democratic
nominee for president, was
elected in the presidential
straw vote conducted by the
Scarlet and Black. The Victory
for Wilson was clear cut as he
received a comtortahle major-
ity over all the votes cast. Col-
onel Roosevelt was the second
choice and his support from
the men was even larger than
was expected by the enthusias-
tic Bull Moosers, Woman's
rights went down to sad defeat
by merely one vote and this
blow was dealt by the women
themselves, too.

Faculty Ballot Is
In Wilson’s Favor;

Pres. Maln‘to Voto
' For Roosevelt

September 21, 1917.

in a straw ballot, conducted
yesterday by the Scarlet and
Black among . the Faculty
members, Wilson d e l e B t 9 l1
Roosevelt for president by one
vote while President Taft found
but one supporter. The result of
ot the ballot of the legal voters
gave Wilson fourteen, Roose-
velt thirteen, Tait one and sev-
en members were either unde-
cided at this time or did not
care to commit themselves. . r .

The significant fact of the
whole census of political thought
among the professors is the
overwhelming progressiveness
of thelr beliefs. All those Voting
for both Wilson and Roosevelt
call themselves progressive,
and without single exception
the non-committal: declared
themselves in favor of progres-
sive principles,

Among the followers of tho
Bull Moose party there are
many tamer Republicans and
their reasons for their change
of political affiliation are three-
fold:

Dissatisfaction with President
Tait; disgust with the action
oi the Chicago convention; a
conviction that the Progressive
platform is based upon true re-
form motives.

President Main in explaining
his vote for President said, “It
I could VDtO for an individual
i should vote for Mr. Wilson;
as it is, 1 shall probably vote
the Roosevelt ticket. But I
would not do that if i were
voting for Roosevelt as an in-
dividual." The Chief interest
President Main has in the third
party is to knock out the ma-
chine meihod of politics and
thus give the people a new grip
upon their government. if the
mass of people could once real-
ize this, Mr. Main thinks the
Progressive party would poll 3
land-slide vote.

Duties of Deans
Are lndefinable

By CONNIE ERICSON

Although the duties of the ltih
dent deans and the provost and
dean of the college are clean
enough to the deans themselveii
and satisfactorily conjectured
by some at the students. the
actual functions oi the three
are indeflnable—if not inexpll-
cable—and unfamiliar to most
students.

Dean Alice 0. Low, in chergl
of residences, and Dean S, Eu-
gene Thompson, ln charge of
uilderclass advising, function ’
"almost like it central coordla
nating office.” said Dean Low.
Despite the overlap of the ace:
demic and social areas of .3,
student's life and the import-
tance of one to the other, the
student deans emphasise the
non-academic side of student
life through their counseling and
active participation in student
affairs.

Because Grinnell has the pro-
blems of a residential college
and a college in which impor-
tant policy changes are formu-
lated by arbitration rather than
by administrative authoritar-
ianism, the so-called “power"
of the deans is complicated and
the “definable" functions Vague.
Their daily agenda is varied and
the pressing issues unpredict-
able. Problems of dormitory
living are worked on constantly,
according to Dean Low. as an
a few other issues, but all-came
pus issues such as the current
debate on home rule and open
dorms change from year to
year. The resolution, however.
of such problems is never com-
plete but “problems are not
dismissed or considered unreal
just because they cannot be re<
solved," explained Dean Thomp-
son.

The case for student selfe
determination is not only re-
cognized by the upper echelons
of the college but is being
worked toward particularly by
the institution of the resident
advisor system, stated Dean
Low. "We ate trying to find
a better way of establishing
student responsibility so that as
changes are made they are
made with a grassroots kind of
structure."

Student responsibility, student
maturity, and student powen
are battiecries The real ques-

the tendency to steer it in a

The proposal seems to be
aimed at creating a better at-
lnnsphere for experimentation
by reducing the inhibitions stu.
dents have concerning class
participation The role of a
grading system as significant
in inhibiting student participa-
tion and discussion is, how-
ever, questionable. William Pol-
iak and John Willis both com-
mented that the size o! the
classes (over 25 students per
class) is too large to accommo-
date discussions easily. This ll
quite plausable. Seminars on

rial which they cover is more
narrowly defined, In such 6' -
cumstances, discussions thrivo
and are beneﬁcial. in large
classes with less defined inter-
est areas and no concrete, sub-
stantive objectives, discussion
is understandably less success-
fill.

in brief, several tactors exist
which appear to hamper the
Social Studies experiment. The
size of the classes, the lack of
concrete objectives, and the un-
certainty among the staif con-
ceming how the material should
be presented are three problems
which are vital to the experi-
ment. How the credit-fail sys-
tern will help in eliminating
these conditions is difficult to
understand

Forensic Club
Holds Meeting

The Grinnell College Foren-
sic Club revived in tradition
Saturday by holding the Fif-
teenth Annual Grinnell Discus-
sion Conference. The intention
of the conterence was to pro«
vide background and stimulate
thought on the 1968~69 collegiate
debate topic, Resolved: That
executive control of United
States foreign policy should be
signiﬁcantly curtailed.

The conference opened with
l general meeting addressed
by a panel of speakers on the
topic. The lectured speaker was
Dr. Fred Morrison, Assistant
Professor of Law and Political
Science at the University of
low, who gave his analysis of
the problems presented by the
topic. Professor Joseph Wall
and Assistant Professor Neal
Milner of the Grinnell faculty
followed with their impressions
of the situation. The three also
answered questions raised by
the attending students.

Following the general meet-
ing, the participants met in
small groups for three rounds
of discussion on the question or
what the scope of executive
control or toreign policy should
be The aim of the discussions
was to determine the nature at
the problem, its cause, and
possible solutions to the prob-
lem.

Attending the conierence
were about sixty students, in-
cluding ten members of the
Grinnell Forensic Club. Other
colleges sending participants
included Mankald (Minn)
State, Wanhurg, William Penn,
Simpson, the University of
Town, St. Ambrose, Monmouth,
and Washington University of

May Appearance
Set for Cyclone

Cyclone 196869, the Giinnell
College yearbook, will appear
in May. Only one issue of the
Cyclone ls being published this
year. Stephanie Kreuger, Cy-
clone editor, is confident that
the Cyclone can be a publica-
tion that all the students will
appreciate.

The staff is attempting to
strike some sort of medium be-
tween 3 middle - of - the - mad
yearbook and a photographic
essay, instead of using a
“theme," the mood of the cam-
pus will be portrayed by an
essay and candid photographs
of campus life. Although it is
virtually impossible for the Cy-
clone tn be completely objec-
tive, according to the editor,
the enlarged staff of 28 will at-
ford a greater cross-section of
campus opinion.

This year the Cyclones is op-
erating under a new financial
arrangement with the college.
At this point all funds are
coming from the sale of adver-
tisements and subscriptions. If
not subscriptions at $6.00 each
are not sold, the Cyclone will
receive funds from SGA. Miss
Kreuger said that she is iairly
certain that the quote will be
reached and passed.

Miss Kxeuger says that the
yearbook must serve four func-
tions. A yearbook is an artistic
creation which must be journal-
istically responsible. it must be
a marketable item which an
peals to the students and is

Cyclone serves as training for

Editor Kreuger thinks that
there is a definite need for a
yearbook. The yearbook should
not duplicate the "Sell Grinnell"
approach of the catalogue. In
portraying the “Grinnell un-
derneath,” the Cyclone givel
the students a capsule of the
moods and emotions of a par«
ticular time in their lives.

response thus far from the stu-

‘dents and administration, hopes

to avoid the mistakes of the
past by remaining financially

Modern Music Musings

ay lot-m GARDNER

The first of five contemporary
concerts to be directed thin
year by Paul Zonn was staged
Saturday night at 8:00 in ARH.
It featured very little twelvos
tone music, and combined eleos
Ironic effects with conventional
musical instrumentation in only

one piece, sanctum ill by Mr.
Zonn. Sparse instrumentation
was used in the program, pro-
ducing less an effect of clusters
oi tones than of voices with
separate identities, especially
when very different ranges of
one or two instruments were put
together.

The first composition, "June.
titres" by Mario Davidovsky.
was commissioned by Bowdoin
College and first performed
there in 1966. Davidovsky is
known as a pure electronic or
electronicewith-instrument coni-
poser, and works with the Col-
umhia - Princeton Electronic
Music Center. Mr. Marsh, violin.
Mr. Purswell, flute, and Mr.
Zonn, clarinet, performed the
piece. Wide dynamic range was
suggested by the three instru-
ments. which were rarely used
all together.

Mr. Zonn calls the next num-
ber, "Solo Piece", by Karllns,
“a tried and true piece" aiter
over 100 performances in New
York and Chicago. “It ex-
plores the complete dynamic
range and technical range of
the clarinet," he adds. Employ-
ing flutter—tongue technique in
some passages, “Snlo Piece” is
a good introduction to contems
porary techniques in solo wood.
wind playing. These vary from
composer to composer, and are
constantly added to.

Mr. Zonn comments that com-
posers of innovative music with
new techniques are sending a
considerable amount cl music
to Grinncll “since they know at
it as a center for new music."
This reputation, which has been
built in the last year, was
added to by a Broadcast Music
Incorporated (BMl) article last
May on new music at Grinncli.

The next piece on the par
gram, Sonorurn ill, was scored
for piccolo and two channel

tape recorder. “Senorum”
means sound, and it is a "sound
piece." The ups effects were
electronic manipulations of
some of the piccolo sounds, and
some that could be produced by
the piccolo. Souonnn in fall:

into three sections: 1) slow; 2)
lwinging, with the tape suggest-
ing a jazz combo and the solo
instrument playing a jazz line
above; 3) slow material. Mr.
Zonn wrote it last April, and it
was commissioned by Mr.
Purswell. who played the picco<
lo. Purswell's sound was very
ﬂexible, meandering often be.
tween pitches (which Zonn mcnc
tmns as a Furswell “bag").
The premiere performance of
the 7-minute composition wal
at Johns Hopkins this year.

Lou Harrison's “First Concers
to for Flute and Percussion"
came next on the program.
(Harrison, a west coast com-
poser, is a friend of John Cage)
The piece is scored for 3 small
drums, a bell, and a flute. It
uses a dlatonic kind of scale,
and, like much oriental music
by which it was influenced.
sounds less dlssonant than un-
familiar to the listener. It roe
sembles an Indian raga in that
the same basic pulse is estabs
Iished and used consistently.
Besides the South American
“guil’o,” which is played by
scratching its surface, the ins
stmments also showed distinct
Eastern influence.

The final composition in the
concert was Robert Morris'
“Sangita ’67.” it involved 13
players on flute, strings, and
percussion, ranging from cello
to Celeste. Two conductors co-
ordinated figures played by the
group from music which givel
rhythmical and pitch sugges.
tions. in “Sangita,” also, dice
sonance is avoided in favor of n
floating, oriental kind of hath
monic environment.

At the end at the concert, I
panel composed of Paul Hersh,
Richard Howe, and Patrick
Pursweil discussed the program,

Paul Zonn, seemed to work, and

concerts,

Two Grinneii Farmers: A Profile

By STEVEN GROW

How much does the Grinnell College student know about the
Midwestern farmer? Last week, the 58d} polled a biased sample of
students represenung the seven major minorities on the campus.
of the groups polled, only the cross country team was 100% certain
that there are tar-ms within walking distance of this campus, But
what of the farmers themselves? What kind of work does farming
involve? What do local farmers think about Grinneli College? To
ﬁnd out, the Sim interviewed two local farmers.

“Farming is a big business," according to Mr. Maynard kai-
lety. Mr. Ratfety {arms loo acres southeast of Grinnell. He raised
com, soybeans, and dairy cattle. According to Mr. Ratiety. the
typical iarmer does most or the work himself. He not only plows
tields, but also purchases supplies, bargains with buyers, and re«
pairs his own equipment. He also has a current knowledge of hy-
brid seeds, chemicals {or weed control, and fertilizers. Farmers
oiten know much about veterinary medicine and keep informed
about livestock breeding and market trends. in other words, the
farmer usually rims every part of his business.

Farming is not all riding tractors and chasing cowsl What
kind of training do farmers have? Both of the men interviewed
have college degrees. Both men are also sons oi iarmers. Accord-
ing to Mr. Raymond Harris, who farms 430 acres north of Grinneli,
this is common. The best way to learn the business is to grow up
With it. Another reason is that a large investment is necessary to
start a farm.

A 300 acre farm with equipment, seed, and livestock would
cost at least $130,000, according to ligures supplied by Mr. Harris.
For this investment the average tanner has a net income of only
about $5,000 a year. "This is an average," said Mr. Harris, “it is
a little higher in iowa.”

i asked Mr. Rafieiy why a man with his training is content to
make so little money for his time. He has a degree in mathematics
1mm Brown University.

“Farming is the last of the individual free enterprises,” said
Mr. Railei He enjoys being his own boss, He also enjoys the
rural liic . farm is a good place to raise children,” commented
Raifety.

Are farmers very active in politics? According to Mr. Harris
and Ml'-. Raifety, the lariner is about as active as the average citi-
zen. "Some farmers are quite active in politics," said Ratiety.
Mr. Harris is a Candidate for Poweshiek County Supervisor.

Besides party politics, many farmers are active members oi
organizations to promote their interests. Tile tour leading organi-
zations are the Farm Bureau, the National Farmers Organization
(NFC), the Farmers Union, and the Grange,

"The Farm Bureau is mostly concerned with getting good
legislation," stated l-larris. “It has lobbyists in Congress and in
many state legislatures.” Also it provides many services to the
tarmer.

“Farmers should have some control over the price at which
they sell their products," said Rafiety in explaining the NFO's
goals. The NFO is trying to persuade tarmers to bargain collective-
ly with buyers.

The Grinnell farmer is a busy man. But what does he think
or the College?

Mr. Raffety is concerned about the violence on some college
campuses, “We read in the newspapers about all the violence on

 

 

Several calves on Mr. Rallety‘s iarm.

some campuses," he said. “Some kids don't seem to appreciate all
the sacrilice that helped make the college great. Many or us have
been waiting and hoping ihat the majority of students, who don‘t
believe in Violence and disruptions, would state their views."

“What will socieiy be like iiizeen years tram now it good
men do nothing?” asked Railety.

Grinnell College in particular? “A lot oi townspeople are con-
cerned about the iact that Grinnell seems to have no rules," said
Raiiety, a member of the Grinnell school board. “What influence
are the students having on our children?” He implied that the
students oi Grinnell have some responsibility In the community
mwhich they live and that many students do not seem to realize

is.

Relations between students and townspeople? “Some students
seem to enjoy antagonizing townspeople with their behavior,"
commented Ratiety. Both Harris and Raitety agreed howevei, that
Grinnell students ate generally “good Lids. " , '

Lewis Book Helps Find Paradise Lost

By ELEONORE SPIEGEL

Revolution and rebellion seem
to be the watchwtu‘ds oi the
Western world these days, even
in a part of it so isolated irom
“reality" as Grinnell is said to
be. since i wish to encourage
progress, including revolution,
though revolution seems cir-
cular rather than progressive,
1 thought I would do my civic
duty — which Mr. Arieti, in his
usual, inimitable manner, helped
me see -— and point out that the
greatest rebel in history is Satan
and that we might do better if
we followed such an illustrious
model. Milton has given us one
of the best literary treatments
of Satan: and there will he sev-
eral courses next semester
teaching Milton, to help us be-
come ever better rebels, no
doubt. but ior those people who
are too impatient to wait till
next semester or feel the press-
ing need now to be the best
rebels we can, i highly recom-
mend C.S. Lewis' short book A
Preface to Paradise lost.

Lewis' chapter on Satan he-
gins by reminding us that tho
pro-Victorian Romantics thought
Milton made him a great and
glorious figure. And we must
certainly concur with their view,
though it seems curious, I know
to say that progress can be
made by returning to preVicton
ian ideas. but, then, progress
works in mysterious ways —-
doesn't it?

At any rate, Lewis points out
that Satan, in the beginning ol
Paradise LNK, really is an im-

pressive figure. He is like “the
Sun new ris‘n" (1.594); he stood
“In shape and gesture proudly

. like a Tow'r” (1590-1): and
he was the emperor of “Godlike
shapes and forms/Excelling
human” (1358-9). Besides be
ing glorious in his person. Satan
is glorious in his cause. He has
been treated unjustly ~ or ii-
legally, as we say today — and
so he prefers "to reign in Hell,
than serve in Heaven" (1.263).

Though Satan prefers Hell to
Heaven, he is not happy there.
He cannot take over Heaven,
he knows; but, like a great reir
el. he Won't admit defeat and
chooses instead to light injustice
with injustice by corrupting
Adam and Eve. His light now
isn't quite as glorious as his
light for liberty and equality
(v.790-2); but he is still lighting,
and that, surely is What really
counts.

Lewis points out that Satan
shows an almost human side or
his character in the Garden or
Eden. Spying on Adam and Eve,
he overhear: their tender talk
and sees them kissing; and he
turns aside “with jealous leer
malign" (IV.503). We don't see
him lighting for the cause in
that description, but isn’t it
good to know that such a fine
rebel wasn’t without normal
sexual impulses, even though he
was an angel?

Lewis also points out that Sa-
tan isn't comfortable anywhere.
We have seen him as the emper-
or of Hall, as the general vali-
ant in defeat, and as the lusty

spy, but he isn’t happy in any
at those roles. He doesn't ever
Seem to feel that he is where
he ought to be; wherever he la,
“Within him Hell/He brings
(IV, 2M). And no wonder; a
creature trying to turn the uni-
verse upside down can hardly
hope for peace at mind.

He does nﬂt succeed in turn-
ing things upside down; but he
does succeed, you remember,
in corrupting Adam and Eve.
Jubilant, he returns to Hell and
makes a speech to his subjects;
but God's judgment or him is
fulfilled and, as he finishes his
speech, “down he lell/o mon.
strous Serpent on his Belly
prone," (X5134). Here in Book
x he has come a long way,
Lewis says, irom the proud em-
peror or Book 1. But we milst
not he dismayed. After all,
what could be better than to be
A healthy animal?

Now I’ve only summarized
one or Lewis' points on Satan—
there are many mare—and his
book deals with more in Phra-
dise lost than only Satan. Al-
most everyone, not only rebels,
can benefit irom reading it.
Rebels of course, will find near<
1y everything in the book "rele~
vent”, Those students interested
only in academics and not in
“real life” will find Lewis help-
1ul in their studies of Milton.
And, lastly, Lewis writes so
angelically that it anyone rlis<
likes both politics and acade-
mics, he may read the book as
a “valuable aesthetic experi‘
ence”.

POS‘l' Mori'em: By John Gordley

The history or the forum‘s
game room includes many EX<
amples of fine bridge playing,
Diiiicult hands have been bid
with precision, and impossible
contracts have been made. Ov-
er the years, the high quality
of playing has not only con-
tinued, but it has gradually im-
proved. One characteristic oi
the resulting game, however, is
that in some unusual instances,
the contracts bid and made have
been reached by unusual means.
Our linest players have learned
to successfully supplement Gor-
en bidding \vith their own im-
proved bids, leading in more
exact communication between
partners, and to greater success.

On rare occasion, a combine»
non of Friday night exuberance
and resultant bidding inac—
curacy prcduces a contract
unique even to the Forum’s
time honored tradition ol piny—
ing unusual bridge. One such
auction took place recently on

that the introduction at a new

By GLENN LEGGETT

Justice Abe Fortas begins his
final chapter to his Concerning
Dlssent and Civil Disobedience
with the following sentence:
The story of man is the his-
tory, first, of the acceptance
and imposition of restraints
necessary to permit commu-
nal life; and, second, of the
emancipation of the individ-
ual within that system of nec-
essary restraints.

it is not an original observa-

tion certainly, but it is an es
pecially important one now,
when the concepts of individual
liberty and communal order are
getting so polarized that ra-
tional consideration cl differ-
ent points of view is extraordi-
narily difficult. Justice Forias
is telling us with a nice matter—
oHaCt precision that the issue
is not personal rights or com-
munal rights but rather per
sonal rights and communal
rights, not either-or but both-
and.
g I wish we could make Justice
Fortas‘ statement our text. for
the perennial debate in our
academic community over who
is violating whose rights, who
is misusing whose powers or
not using them properly, and
who is counting the votes in
whose participatory democracy.
it we could use the statement
as a text, we might be able to
recognize that our academic
community is really a plural-
ism of communities made up
of different kinds of people.
Most of them would like to dis<
charge both their obligations to
themselves and to others gra-
ciously enough to allow us to
say that we have at Grinnell at
least the spirit of a single com-
munity,

Why not? Chiefly, I suppose,
because all 1400 of us students,
faculty. and staff live so close-
ly together here that at times

we appear to deal with each
other with our nerveendings
rather than our best and most
communicative Voices. Speak-
ing for myself, I think my
chief obligation is to preserve
and enhance the reputation of
.the College as an institution
worthy of support and affection,
not only from students and fac-
ulty but from alumni and
friends to what goes on on
campus. Students and faculty
have different responses, and
I respect them. asking only
that they respect mine.

At this moment we appear
to have a plethora of problems.
Any college does. A college like
Grinnell with a superior student
body and faculty, each operat<
ing on the other's sensibilities,
is going to have more than
most. We need to remember
that a revolution in many
things is underway, every-
where, and as Martin Luther
King Jr. suggested here last
year, we aren't going to be
able to sleep through it at Grin-
nell. But I know too that, as a
community of students and fac-
ulty, we have the wit and con-
cern to make things work out
Well. Indeed, We can follow the
lead of what a good many stu-
dents and faculty are already
trying to do: to set up both
formal and informal procedures
for listening and talking, for
objecting and resolving, for pro«
posing and studying and recom<
mending. In general, we can
create structures that are both
definite and viable enough to
let us consider proposals for di<
rection and change with the
liberal disposition that a col-
lege like ours is supposed to
be creating in all of us.

The student-laculty Commit-
tea on Student Aflairs is a
structure of such procedures.
50 is the Judicial Council and
the revised Committee on Stu-

dent Publication! and Radio.
So will be the impending reor-
ganlmtioli of several faculty
committees to include student
representation. So too. hope-
fully, will be the newly insti-
tuted student advisory system
and the expanded resident ad-
viser program. Though some
difficult matters Such as the
change in women’s hours and
the residence hall system have
already been instituted, none
at the structures is secure
enough or experienced enough
at this moment to warrant an
easy optimism, and none of
them will make the place as
perfectly reasonable as each
one of us might ideally WlSl’l.
But we are at least started.
and the job now is to lessen
the gap between the problems
that keep appearing and our
procedures [or dealing With
them intelligently.

We will have some agonles
but I thlnk we can do it. We
have to. To reter to Justice
Forlas again and to paraphrase
him:

The survival of our society as
a free, open, democratic coni-
muiiity will be determined by
the procedures — the rules of
conduct, the methods, the
practices a which survive
the confrontations. For pro<
secure is the bone structure
oi a democratic society; and.
the quality of procedural
standards which meet general
acceptance a the quality of
what is tolerable and per
missable and acceptable con-
duct —— determines the dur-
ability of the society and the
survival possibilities of free«
dom within the society.

For ourselves here at Grin-
nell that kind of society is es<
sential; and we might remema
her, as the man says, that
such a good society, like Char-
ity, begins at home.

Campus Events:

Homecoming, Love’s Labor's Losl'
By ALLAN HART

Aside from the usual enter-
talnment of the typical Grin-
nell weekend, the Homecoming
Weekend that is now upon us at-
fortls all sorts of new thrills. For
example, there will be a con-
glomeratlon oi parents mingling
around the campus, and along
with the alums, they will go
through the traditional period of
shock at the degeneration of
Grinnell students. To counteract
this moral indignation, there
will he concerts and theatrical
productions performed by those

students who have not yet fallen
under the influence at the less
upright students.

Accordingly, the first major
event of Homecoming is the col-
lege production of “Love's La-
bol's Lost” by William Shake-
speare. It is directed by Robert
Ingam, and the leads will he
played by William Saylor, Bren-
da Thomas, Elizabeth Wich-
matiu, and Fritz Schwallor. It
begins at s p.m. on Friday, in
Roberts Theatre. A: the ama

time on Saturday the play will
be given again.

Then at 8:30, both Friday and
Saturday, the Grinnell College
Choir and Chamber Orchestra
will perform in Herrick Chapel.

There will be two movies on
Friday night. The first will be
the regular ARI-l film at 9:30,
which this week will be “Key
Largo." At 10:30 in the Forum
South Lounge, “Days of Dylan
Thomas" and “A Child's Christ-
mas in Wales” will be shown.

On Saturday there will be
many activities to deepen the
numbness of the previous gem
eration. After a 9:30 a,m. coilea
hour in the residence halls,
there will be an informal sym-
posia with various representa-
tives of the administration and
students, starting at 10:30 in
the dorms. Between 11 am. and
12:30 pm. a buffet luncheon
will be served in both
the Quad and in Cowlcs
Hall. Alter the afternoon sport
events, we will be revived dra<
matlcally by a charcoal steak
dinner in the Quad and in
Cowles. Following this them
will be the alorementioned thear
. .i . .

i'ii mu

tre and choral performances.
Then the big dance will titillate
our minds and bodies. Featuring
the Pizaht Brothers Orchestra,
the Homewmilig dance will also
bring tears of nostalgia to many
guests. Of course the women will
be bedeckcd with ﬂowers dis<
tributed by enterprising, bush
ness-nlillded men for the local
florists.

That finishes the activities at ‘

Homecoming, not to mention the
adults' visiting during that time.

On Sunday, things get back to
some old degenerate scene, ex-
emplified by the Open Darius;
doubtless students will have sent
their parents home before then.
At 8:00 the Forum movie at Fri-
day night will be reshown, and
so will the ARl-l movie (9:30).

The regular Monday night
Bridge lessons will again be
held at 7:30 in the dining area
of the Forum.

Finally on Wednesday a jam
session will he held in the Forum
North Lounge, at 10:30 p.m.

With all these swell things
going on, who will think of fall-
ing to the usual depths of de-
gradation?

By KATHERINE NEWKIRK

It is an easily accepted fact that in the town of Grinnell, and
throughout lowa, there live a number of families of “poor folk."
However, it is not commonly known that families here living below
the poverty level number one in tour, a ratio comparing unfavor-
ably to the national average of one in five. Thus we see that the
pleasant rural community and the college are not, in fact, far
distant from the poverty problem, and from the war on poverty.

0n the state level, the problem is being attached by the office
at Economic Opportunity (CEO). Dr. C. Edwin Gilmur, instructor
at Political Science at Grinnell, served as the ﬁrst director of the
program beginning in June 1965. Under his year-long administration
each county was organized, and local programs were started. Grin-
uell is included in a four county program including Poweshiek.
Benton, Tama, and iowa counties. The center is at Belle Plaine.
it is the duty of the Regional organization to identify the problems
of this particular area, to identity resources available to mobilize
them, and to establish a system of priorities to determine how
resources shall be used. Programs begun by the regional commit-
tee include a year-round Head Start program, a medical services
center, and a regional multipurpose center.

According to Mr. Gilmour, the “guts" of the poverty program
is the Community Action Program (CAP), which is centered in

each community. One important goal of CAP is to turn the pro-
grams back to the target group to carry out. Efiorts are made to
employ the underprivileged, and to help them organize them-
selves. The feeling expressed by Mr. Gilmour is that programs
administered by disaffected people are “demanding and dehuman-
izing" to the people at whom they are directed.

The 0E0 and CAP programs are both products of the current
“War on Poverty." Being new, they have encountered several
problems in trying to add their elforts to already existing church,
private, and educational efforts. They found the "olrlrlineH agencies
were resentful of the new programs. Many feel that the new pro—
grams have failed to do as they promised and that they have not
eliminated the Waste and red tape that were found in the earlier
decentralized system.

Mr. Gilmour expressed discouragement over the present trend
oi the poverty program for several reasons. He feels that the CEO
could be “the most promising new look in this century,” but that
the program is not understood and that in practice it has adopted
many of the characteristics of the old line agencies. Gllmcur ad-
vocates organizing the poor people so that they may become their
own representatives, He feels that they may become a powerful
political force, but until they do so, they will continue to be looked
down upon and catered to, and kept in their places as “second
class citizens.”

Other programs are underway to combat poverty in the area.
The four - county region is served by a total of 10 VISTA workers.
one living in the Grinnell community. it is the goal of these work-
ers to live in the area, among the people, and to give them as-
sistance in a personal way.

Miss Rita Zollner, the 20~year<0ld Grinnell VISTA volunteer
explained that her time is spent helping the entire community,
not only those in the lower income brackets. She gives as her
services tutoring, helping with the Uncle Sam's Club, advising the
Neighborhood Youth Corps, and working at the regional multi-
purpose center iu Malcolm, She is currently involved in organizing
a club lor mothers who receive assistance under the Aid to De-
pendent Children program. having been here 2 months, she ex-
plained that her progress has begun slowly because she wants to
learn to know the people and to have them trust her.

The Grinnell League of women Voters is also interested In
the poverty problem, and particularly in housing problems. They
are in tile process of organizing a survey to determine just what
housing conditions are in Griniiell and what may be done about
them.

College students interested in helping in the various battles
ol the war against poverty in Griniiell may do so by giving time
to the Uncle Sam's Club, by assisting teachers of the Head Start
program, or by providing aid in the League Survey For details
on available opportunities, place requests in the son mailbox. .

Student Involvement

Robert Asbille in his letter to the
5&3 states that discussions on open
dorms are dangerous. But the discus-
sions have a greater significance than
the question. Even such a trivial topic
as open dorms gives the students the
opportunity to become involved in
some form of political activity.

In the general gloom following the
defeat of Senator Eugene McCarthy
in Chicago, it seemed that many
young people felt the time had come
.to turn away from standard political
activity, either to organize into secret
and militant groups, or to simply turn
in on themselves, in an apathetic with-
drawal to abandon the community.
,The system seemed to fail in what
many believed to be a clear case of
right and wrong.

The fact that thus far Grinnell stu-
dents are fighting the administration
-—the campus’ symbol of the establish-
ment—through peaceful means is a
Sign that the despair after Chicago
was temporary. The Senate’s proposal
for 24 hour open lounges, which has
now been approved by the Committee
on Student Affairs, is an example of
this.

Of course, we hope that the students
here will move on to more worthwhile
enterprises. In this week‘s S&B there

Dancing

Editorial from 5&3, Jan. 21, 1911

. . . The developments of the past
few days have forced us to express
ourselves one way or the other. So
we are giving our personal view,
which is that dancing should be recog
nized by the College as a legitimate
form of entertainment.

To those who are didactically op-
posed to this view we would like to
make a few suggestions: First, that
there is nothing inherently wrong
about gradually changing or modify-
ing any or all of the College tradi-
tions, They were formed for us, not
we for them. Times change and cus-
toms with them. For instance, dancing
is regarded entirely differently than
it was ten years ago. Anyone living in
a small community appreciates the
change of attitude.

Secondly, dancing in Grinnell is
favored by a fairly representative
body of people and not, as many
would like to suppose, by a lower
Strata of the student body.

Thirdly, that great numbers of in-
stitutions similar to Grinnell, recog-
nize dancing and do not seem to find

pearl xadoia. sneenn srown

are articles on poverty in Grinnell and
the Uncle Sam’s Club, activities in
which students can do useful work for
the community.

A Constructive Proposal

An article in this week’s 5&3 men-
tions that the coffee house has been
a failure. The failure of the coffee
house is attributable to Americans’
dislike for the finer coffees that exist,
and their tolerance for the “dirty Wat-
er” served in this country. The coffee
house was a fine addition to the forum
in theory, but it has proved too un-
popular to be profitable.

The game room, on the other hand,
has been a greater success than the
architects supposed it would be. There
are frequently long lines of students
wishing to use the pool tables, and the
bridge tables are often full.

It may be argued that the coffee
house serves the overflow crowd from
the grill. It must be remembered,
however, that the grill serves the ov-
erflow crowd of bridge players. By
constructing another game room, the
bridge players would have more room,
and there would be more opportuni-
ties for those who play pool.

It would therefore seem reasonable
to convert the failing coffee house into
another game room. The college
should find the funds for the room’s
conversion.

the great and insurmountable difficul-
ties which people say would ensue
here. And, strange as it may seem,
these institutions turn out a fairly
good type of manhood and woman-
hood — not so frivolous and utterly
nonsensical as not to compare quite
favorably with Grinnell products.

Fourthly, that dancing would not
strike such a blow at the democracy
of the College as many prophesy. Just
as it is now, each one would be free to
choose his own amusement, be it
vaudeville, comic opera, strolling, or
dancing. In this respect, we should
hope that dancing would prove a de-
cided uplift.

We are not advancing these as argu-
ments in favor of dancing. As far as
we are concerned—and for that mat-
ter the whole Senior class — dancing
is not absolutely essential for a happy
life in Grinnell, We should show a
sad lack of initiative and individuality,
indeed, we did not in four years find
something well qualified to take its
place. Nevertheless, those who would
like to see dancing established in
Grinnell have ample ground on which
to base their argument.

D. M. Gibson's Father
Criticizes 5&3 Policy

My dear Mr. Editor-lirChief:

I wish to call your attention
to numerous errors in the news-
paper of which you are ludi-
catcd to be the editor-inchiei.
in doing so. 1 refer to the issues
dated September 20 and 21,
1968. Having noted that these
are issues No. 1 and No. 2.
please know that I recognize the
newness of your position and
therefore am understanding in
many aspects the lack of pre-
ciseness and clarity in certain
articles. Undoubtedly in the fu-
ture your record will be vastly
improved.

Following are the items that
disturbed me the most, Per-
haps these same gross lnade«
quacies have come to the at-
tention of millions of other
readers of your newspaper.

1. You err in noting that the
new physical education plant is
not in high priority. Vast sums
of money must he spent ii Grin-
nell is to achieve No. 1 status
among the nation's major col-
lege football teams. This is sim
ple logic and it disturbs me that
it has escaped you and your
associates.

2. The name of David M.
Gibson is mentioned only three
times in the above two issues.
This is. of course. completely
unacceptable to vast numbers of
your readers.

3. Your own name is mention-
ed in small print on one or two
occasions. I iaii to see why
even these references are
necessary.

These are only a few items
that come quickly to mind. The
errors are so numerous that I
cannot but Wonder where the

to press.

Please excuse me for writing
to you in such a direct manner.
However, you are undoubtedly
a busy man and it occurs to me
that only a forceful and truthful

train: the barrier that per-

To the Editor!

I am writing this letter be-
cause I feel an intense disgust
with the medieval scholasticism
that tends to pervade the edi-
turial column or this paper.
What has finally cracked my
erstwhile solid apathy towards
the pettiness of the Grinnell
campus was that wretchedly
thought out and executed edi-
torial that ended with a state-
ment as simple and foolish as
“any rithhinking person must

effect. The banal triteness (the
redundant phrase is deliberate.

statement rests on two powetﬁ

that the editor feels that he is
capable of determining who in
"rightrthinking" and who is no

all of them agree with himself,

Such an attitude indicates an
intellectual conceit that is not
only unwarranted (lndee
crassly undeserved), but on
tremely unhealthy in today’l
society. After all. wasn’t it Hit-
ler and isn’t it Wallace who
pretend to know "what is right
for us?" Secondly, and perhapl
more subtly, is the assumption
that anarchy is the worst evil
in the world. Before one make]

dersland the axioms that under

Anarchy offers no horror to

that is one of the most clearly

To point out an almost pore
fect example of what I have
been saying about the petty,
scholasticisrn of this campus,
I wish to refer to the some subs
high school mentality that I
happened to hear express in
views after Adam Clayton
Powell spoke. This perrinesn
personified had taken refuge in
that trait so typical of the out-
classed high school debator -—
he attacked definitions in [ha
hope of finding a weakness
of minimizing his demoralizin-
tion when he could not find a
mistake in logic and yet did
not wish to admit to the acs

thrusts. The problem is not that
this individual sought to una-
lyze the definitions. but that
he lost sight of the basic quess
mm, and in doing so missed
the point that Powell was malt-

lystem of government that has
come along in a good many
years. That is to say, the con-
servative structure of the gov-
ernment of the United States,
as seen in its vulnerability to
the interests of a well»placed
and/or wealthy few and its al-
most total immobility when
faced by the non-advantaged
multitudes, has resulted in tho
near-perfect instance of John-
Ion, unyielding on Vietnam,
capable of determining his suc-
cessor, gicrying in his paper
triumphs in the field of Civil
liberties.

Thus, when students and
Blacks turn to force, they
should not be condemned mere-
ly because they invite anarchy.
The overwhelming stagnation of
this nation cannot be eliminated
by the fetid odor that is the
self- righteous d e rn a n d for
“reason” when one really
means "acceptance.” I can
only hope that before the edi-
torial staff of the Scarlet and
Hiack decides to inundate its
readers again with Aristotelian
irrelevancies, they r e m o v e
themselves from the Classics
Department and take a course
or two from Professor Goldberg
on such topics as collective be
havior and ideology, power and
society. Or they might cease
studying long enough to take in
such books as Black Power,
Dark Ghetto, Black Skin,
White Mask, or The Colonizer
and the colonized. Then, per-
haps, they will have had some
contact with social reality and
will be less ready to pronounce
the Truth of the Ages at us.

Cites Dangers In
Open Dorms issue

To the Editor:

A c a d e in i o institutions in
America, particularly the lib.
oral arts college, are in grave
danger of suppression. The on

of our intellectual haven to in-
quire into and attack the in-
stitutinns of America has forced
a moderation of the Vietnam
war policy and started people
rethinking almost every aspect
of American society.

These are achievements the
academic community may well
be proud of. But in the process
we have made many enemies:
Wallace and Reagan pose a
very real threat to our freedom.

All students and faculty are
well aware of the restrictions
on academic freedom created
by the involvement of govern-
ment in state universities How-
ever, the liberal arts college
also depends on economic and
political support from outside
its “ivory tower" -— to some
extent from government but
also from alumni and interested
philanthropists. The rapid rise
of tuition is clear testimony
that the financial status of this
college is very serious, The fact
is that the very existence of
the school may depend on alle-
giance with people who do not
like much of what goes on at
Grinneii. Continued academic
quality and academic freedom
is in jeopardy.

Yet we make our own de-
fense even more difficult by
fighting amongst ourselves
about issues like the “open
dorms problem," Much is
wrong with the present situa-
tion. Certainly We should talk
about our problems and try to
make changes. But our attack
on these problems is often an
cessive, immature, and unrea1<
istic. The college is only I
small part of a bigger commu<
nity. issues in that bigger com-
munity are far more important
than social issues at Grinnell.

The time has come that Grin-
nell must begin thinking more
of academic integrity and less
of ”open dorms." I have spent
two years listening and talking
about Grinnell and its problems.
I’m fed up. I want to leam
about America and go out and
change it. The liberal arts edu-

cation gives a student a unique
ability to do this. But if we de-
stroy the college in the process,
then we have defeated our pur-
pose. So then let me urge all
students and faculty to join me
in saying:
GRINNELL, GROW UP!

Corneilian Editor
Explains Editorial

To the Editor:

In reading your editorial of
October 4, and then re-readillg
my own of September 23, I
found that it was indeed possi-
ble for the impression of an ex
post facto philosophy to be con-
veyed. i am writing to point out
that this is not the case.

The editorial which you quoted
contained a comment from
Doug Peterson, Student Govem—
ment (so) Presidentr He is
quoted as saying that student
selfcetermination over their pri<
vate lives and group living con-
ditions is “the overriding princi-
ple by which so will be operat-
ing throughout the year." This
statement, part of an article
Doug wrote lot a THE COR-
NELLIAN Extra, received
campus - wide circulation before
the open dorms election.

The philosophy of student
self-government in these areas
was the platform upon which
Peterson was elected SG Presi-
dent. His election came at the
end of a year in which greater
student awareness of their own
rights and power was manifest.

As you can see, the idea of
student self-determination was
far from new at Cornell. It was
not used to justify the SG action.
It was the framework in which
their proposal was created.

Cornell College, that is, the
students, faculty, and adminis-
tration, are now seeking the
best way to embody this prine
ciple.

l Where the Truth Lies |

By DONALD STUMF

The evening before Richard Schneirov's trial last week, A
pleasant — looking freshman girl greeted me as l emerged from
the dining room and offered me a mimengraphed sheet. I expected.
I suppose, a proposal to have a hike hike; and I got a naked in-
vocation of student power. It began, “Students have the power to
make the rules that govern them" and ended. "THIS is A TRiAbY
OF THE STUDENT BODY'S RIGHT TO SELF REGULATION.”
In between there was the implicit assumption that it is the stu-
dent’s power that gives the right. To be greeted by such Machia-
vellian stuff so soon after dinner unsettled my stomach, especial-
ly the line, “If we stand behind Schneirov, we guarantee our own
safety." I wonder what kind of safety the Schneirov case can offer
anyone, especially the freshman who gave me the sheet.

Now I know that “safety" was used in a very limited sense
in the article. it meant safety from being punished, and as Plato
proves, that is like safety from being healed by a doctor. But ll
do not want to argue on the basis of systematic philosophy; few
men believe that truth lies in philosophy. 1 want to discuss safety in
practical terms, those of the hard, real world. Will student self-
reg‘ulution make students safe from the outside world and them-
selves?

First of all, Will the women of Grinnell have safety from the
onslaught of mail from their mothers? Letters about Schneirov'l
fiveeday indiscretion will descend on the college by the bagfuii in
the coming weeks. Parents have spent 330% to send their offspring
t0 Grinnell; and they have done so With the understanding that (ha
administration, which writes the bulletins and makes the rules.
would be in charge. Not only does the administration have legal
responsibility for the conditions in the dormitories, but it has a
moral responsibility to parents. How many parents would approve
of student rule in the halls? Can one simply turn over control to
the students without any advance waming? Should parents be put
in the position of having to force their children to transfer in the
middle of their college careers it they do not like “home rule?"
At the very least, the college should give a year's warning before
any release of the reins of government. in a system which changer
rapidly and unjustly, no one is safe.

Then what about the safety of the institution as a whole? in a
year when Richard Nixon is about to be elected President on a
conservative platform emphasizing “law and order," the timo
hardly seems ripe for B college to bow to Student power. As I un-
derstand it, Grinnell. is in very tight ﬁnancial straits. i wonder it
the college can avoid the gold shortage now faced by Antioch and
Reed. Radical schools do not attract liberal donors. I hope that in
the next few days some of the faculty will explain the effects at
past radicalism upon the present treasury at Grinnell. if it is n
matter of life or death to the institution, who would hope for self»
determination?

The examples of Antioch and Reed bring up another pointrl
what happens to the composition of the student body at school!
which have the reputations for being most liberal, not to say
libertine? At Antioch, I know, it has become opptessively ilﬂmOv
geneous. Is there no value in having people from a variety of
backgrounds, including such “conservative areas" as the mid-
west? is there nothing to be said for having voices to remind us
of Edmund Burke as well as Machiavelli?

I also wonder about the safety of anyone ruled by a student
government with the following record: one member of the C of Ti
edits an SDS progaganda paper and advocates polarizing issues
so that there can be only two alternatives; another member of
the C of T, whether intentionally or not, played the demagogue at
the Schneirov hearing, calling for a show of hands and power at
what was supposed to be a time of disinterested deliberation; a
third member of the C of T said, while considering the use 0!
student government funds, “You (should) never worry about the
majority;" the C of T as a whole called for hails to discuss “homl
rule" when the decision on the Schneirov case was still pending
and the administration had not defined its position.

Finally, I would ask what satety one would have, under "horn.
rule," from people who do not show “consideratio What will
happen it a student breaks a rule made by his peers and refuses
to be persuaded that he is being inconsiderate? Will students then
confine him to his room, or ostracize him, or mug him? Will they
turn to the administration and ask that he be removed from the
hall? That would be embarrassing to say the least, How would stu-
dents have handled the problems in Cowles Hall two years ago
without the power to punish their peers? Are most people satisfied
with the effectiveness of “home rule” in such matters as quiet
hours in which it now operates?

Of course I am only asking such questions to be perverse. I
realize that what is meant by “home rule" is either no rule at all
or rule by a complaint administration, which will only intercede
at the request of the student body when a problem has become
too ugly to ignore. It means having what one waan without any
annoying responsibilities on the side.

Oscar Wilde once said there is only one thing worse than not
getting what you want, and that is getting it. if students succeed
in their power-play for “home rule," they and the rest of the
college will deserve to have if.

SELECTIVE SERVICE: DRAFT DEFERMENTS'

By DON HECKER

In the first or this series
of articles, I gave u- brief
explanation of the Selective
Service System’s philosophy of
"Cllanuelingi" At that time, I
said that according to the sys<
tem this was accomplished by_
use of classifications,

Classifications are' divided in-
to three basic categories, serv-
ice classifications (tho regis<
trani is considered available tor,
certain types or work or mili-

tary service), deferments (term,

porary exemptions from mill-
tary service). or exemptions (a
permanent classification for a
registrant who cart never be
available for military service).
. Deierments are temporary
exemptions, granted to a regis<
trant while he is performing
some action that is In the na-
tional interest, or while he is
temporarily unilt for military
servlce,

Service classifications are
granted when there are no more
applicable deferments H when
the registrant is no longer do-
ing anything in the national in-
teresl, or when he is not dis-
qualified physically or mental-
ly, and when he is not needed
for the survival of a dependent.
Sole surviving sons in families
where one male member of the
family died or was totally disk
abled in military service are
also permanently exempted.

Exemptions are intended to
be permanent, as in the case of
the 1V-F, in Whlch tho regis-
trant has on adverse condition
which is assumed to bo un-
changing, and which prevents
his ever being available for
military duty, Of course, if this
condition ends or considerably
diminishes, them is cause for
the Board to reclassify the reg
istrant.

The local board is required to
place each registrant in the
“lowest" possible classification
for which he is eligible A “low"
classification is a temporary
one, while a "high" classifica-
tion is a more permanent one.
For example, if a tullrtime stu.
dent at a college applies for an
170 (Conscientious O bj e c t«
or) classification, his draft
board may not place him in that
category, but can place him in
the 1175 category (student deter-
ment), since this may be the
lowest classification for which
he is qualified. When the 11-3
is no longer available, the reg.
istrant may apply for, and pos<
sibly receive an PO (or similar
classification).

A special deferment which
is often extremely important to
college students, and which
used to be important to grad
students is the 175(C). The
Hm), also a mandatory clas-
sification, is a deferment-fol- one
academic year. it is granted to
an undergraduate student satis-
factorily pursuing a course at
study who has recelved en in-
duction notice. The deferment
lasts until the end of the aca-
demic year. It is not renewable,
and any student who has been
classiﬁed in this deferment once
can never again lie so classl-

' tied.

.This. classification is very im
portant in View of a practice or
some boards'ot drafting R'SBII"

ior student before he has {in-
ished his last year of unden-
graduate college. Should the
student receive an induction no-
tice, he may request and must
receive, an 1-S(C) until he com-
pletes the year of school that
he is in.

The I—Y classification is a
sort of mild IV—F. This classl-
iication is granted to those
persons who are physically un-
fit ’ior service in the armed
forces except in time of nation-
al emergency. A national emer-
gency incidentally, is most like-
ly only to be a war.

Authority for determining LY
eligibility rests with the Sur-
geon General of the Army The
tests. to determine eligib' 'ty
for this classification are given
by the army at the induction
centers when a registrant re-
ports for a physical examina-
tion.

[LA is a deferment which is
granted for employment that is
considered to be essential to the
national illterest. \vhich employ-
ment is in the national interest
is decided by the Director ot
Selective Service on the advice
of the National Security Coun.
oil.

A ll—C deferment may be one
of the few things in the world
that will make you wish you
had decided to spend the rest
of your life farming. This par.
ticulsr deferment is granted to
persons for "essential agricul-
tural employment," and is
something oi a leftover from
the 1940’s when farm produc-
tion did not result in the hug.
surpluses of today.

The ”-8 deferment is the one
most of us are concerned with,
and the one we are most famil-
iar with. when the proper con<
diu'ons are met, it is a mandala
tory classification. There are
six basic conditions:

1. The Student must [9-
quest this deferment from
his local draft board. .

2. His college has sent a
Form No. 109 to the regi5<
trant’s local board, indicat-
ing the registrant is a lull-
time student.

3. The student is receiving
credits toward a degree.

4. The student is taking a
fulltime course load (as {it}
fined by the college).

5. The student is making
“satisfactory progress,” that
is, at the end of his first
year, he has received 25%
of his credits toward gradu-
aiion, at the end of his sec<
and year he has received
50% of his crediLs toward
graduation, and so on,

6. This deferment does not
extend past the student's
twenty-fourth birthday.

, This classification is also
mandatory 101‘ graduate stu.
dents in the fields of medicme.

allied fields (subject to the ad
vice of the National Security
Council). Going into medicine
in graduate school is not a
means of escaping the draft,
however, for persons in these
fields are subject to the “doc-
tor's draft,” which is even more
stringent than the regular
draft. , , ,

III-A is the so-called “lather-
hood deferment." It is granted
to men who are married and
have one child (the child need
not yet be born), so long as the
father actally maintains a fam-
lly relationship with the wife
and child.

This classification is normal.
ly not granted to one who has
received a 11-5, unless he can
prove that his being inducted
into the army would cause his
dependents to suffer extrema
hardship.

lV-B is another mandatory
classification, which is granted
to certain elected officials of
the state or federal government.

Anyone who receives a deier<
ment is automatically in the
“extended liability" category.
This means that he may be
drafted at any time until he
reaches age 35. Theoretically,
this is a means of preventing
a man from ”escaping" the
draft by disappearing into the
educational system until he is
26. Age 26 was the previous cul-
olf point, after which you could
not be drafted. This is Still the
case {or men who have never
received a deferment.

Actually, anyone making it
past age 25 is unlikely to be
drafted even it he is in the cute
tended liability category. The
army is not now taking, nor does
lt plan to take men past the
age of to, The army believes
that the younger a man is, the
better soldier he will be, Am
cording to the theory, a young
man has not yet formed many
definite opinions, and his mind
can therefore best be “molded"
into the proper military way or
thinking.

no classification is ever perm.
aneitt.,The local board, upon re-
ceipt of new information about
the registrant can always change
his Classification.

A registrant has certain rights
of appeal. he has the right to
a personal appearance before
his local board, if he sends the
board a request (or a personal
appearance within thirty days
alter he receives his original
notice of classification.

When he receives a classifica-
tion as the result of a personal
appearance, he may also appeal
that to a state board. The state
board may be either in the state
where his local board is located,
or if that. is inconvenient, he
may request that the appeal be
transferred to the state board
where he is employed, or attench
ing school.

FORUM APPRAISAL SHOWS
GOOD THAN BAD

IT MORE

By JONATHAN JENKINS

The College Forum, Grin-
nell's social and recreational
center. was designed by the
architects Skidmore, Owings.
and Merril of Chicago. A two
level building. the dimensions
are 210 feet by 70 feet. Con-
struction was begun in the
spring of 1963 and was com-
pleted late in 1964, The total
cost of the project was soroboo
It was ﬁnanced entirely trim

Fund of 1961494.

According to the folder
handed out in mailboxes earlier
in the semester. the Forum
“exists to provide services and
facilities which help to fulfill
the needs of the campus com-
munity. lt . . . serves as a so-
cial, Cultural. and recreational
center for all students. faculty.

It also serves. one hopes. as a
place where students can con-
verse. not only with themselves.
but also with the laculty. But
how well does it actually serve
these purposes?

Several students told me that

that students tend to segregate

students. was used for study-

them every day. The kitchen-
adjoining the dining
rooms are also quite popular.
according to the Forum direc-
tor. Mrs. Hawk. The rooms
which are set aside for study-
ing are, however, not used too
frequently

Although not all persons in-
terviewed agreed that the For-
ilm always served its purpose
as a place where students could
converse with themselves [or
faculty members. it seems evi-
dent that most people agreed
that it is successful as a social
and recreational center for the
Campus. While many agreed
that it otters a good change of
pace, some felt that it was also
an excuse to avoid studying.
One student, who must remain
unnamed. for obvious reasons,
said that although it was “not
as good as an l-V.” he liked it.
Another stated: “It's more use-
lul than the reception center.”

0n the whole, it appears that
after almost four years of oper-
ation. the Forum is quite slic-
cessflll and that it is One of the
most intensively used buildings

Home Rule: Freedom or Anarchy

By SUSAN KAESER

Recent events have once again made the question of rules in
the residence halls of concern to the college community. The iu<
elliciency, undesirability, and irrelevance ot the present nlle struc-

, ture has been voiced by many factions of the community. faculty

and administration. and has led to,the proposal of an alternative
structure. home rule. However. in considering this Viable alterna-
tive many students are not aware of the concept involved, and
are unable to accept home rule as a possible structure

The problem seems to stem from the traditional nation or
rules. Previously, administrative policy has provided a set at
preventative rules as guidelines to limit student behavior. The regi-
ulations on hours, student use of the lounges and residence halls
have defined what the student cannot do. The student is expected
to cﬂmply and follow the authority.

The idea of home rule is frightening to many because it doesn't
tell the student what he cannot do. Horne rule to many is under-
stood as being anarchy and rampant “freedom." Without pre-
ventive rules, [here is tear of law and order being thrown out the
window. if authority is removed and is not making rules, there
is no rule. This is a gross misconception of home rule. Home
rule can be a viable structure if those exercising it realize its
meaning.

Home rule is a positive form of rules. lt is not a denial of
rules or of a rule. but a posing of positive “do’s” to replace the
traditional “cannot” form ol rule. The arbitrary authority set up
for the student to follow is replaced by students’ thinking about
their actions. The present rule system only gives the student n
choice of breaking or not breaking a rule. He is not considering
his actions beyond the fact of a rule violation. Home rule demands
of the student 3 consideration of the actual implications of his
actions as they atlect others as well as himself.

The granting of home rule is a recognition and challenge to
the student not in his ability to lollow authority, but to develop his
own decision making ability. it is not a safeguard against some
undesirable action, but a stimulant to positive action. It is not
rulelessness, bllt a freedom with responsibility beyond oneself.
This greater awareness and this desire to develop as thinking in-
dividuals is the ultimate demand of home rule Educators and
students in a liberal arts institution should see this as being Very
consistent with their educational aspirations and should willingly
accept the challenge or home rule.

Odette de Lecluse: Franco
America's Chef d’Oeuvre

By ODETTE DE LECLUSE

When anyone travels thmugh France and stops in a small town
or Village for a meal, the usual reaction oi the traveler is a double
one: delight and surprise The tirst is an enjoyable reeling, the
second is an amazed awareness when the tourist compares the
iood to the dreadiul fare dispensed by the places which advertise
themselves as cafes, snack bars, sip 9L bite, and sometimes just
EATS! The last term is appropriate as tar as the actual motion of
putting load in one’x stomach is concerned, although indigestion
hllnws in due time.

Regional cooking in France has always been a source of
pride to the natives We have it in this country but choose tha
easy way out, catering to the tastes of people l shall call “finger-
eateis." Even the rolls and buns sheltering dry hamburgers or
dull hot dogs are soft and soggy, and Just as tasteless ~ they need
wmething strong and pungent to camouﬂage the whole concoction

Iome kind of sweet fizzy liquid oiten called “soda," about as use-
tul as the less tasty powder iorm. This is alien accompanied by
thick mealy “french fries,” which are neither French nor fried,
but strips ot raw potatoes steamed in grease. To top it oh then
is a piece of pie with an anemic undercooked crust at the bottom
or made soggy by starchy ice cream, and vollai

I always take this suspicious, even cynical, approach to the
hot meal offered by these places when it includes a piece of meat
under it piece or solt bread drowning under a starchy gravy along
with potatoes tasting somewhat like wet paper with more or the
lame gravy.

Yet these same places do have rather good Sandwiches land
crisp salads, perhaps because the cooking has been done before by
people who know their job and the vegetables have been lett alone,
One can always reiuse the special "gourmet fancy” dressings that
might ruin the salads.

It is a iact that the steam tables are partly responsible for a
great deal of this tasteless food. Also responsible is the state of
hurry prevalent in the 20th century. One does not want in wait or
uannot wait an hour or more to have something prepared, but there
are quick orders such as omlets, scrambled eggs, liver and kid
neys, and lean cuts oi nieat, all for people who shun waiting.
There are wonderiul soups, stews, and many vegetables which
become even better with the waiting,

Good desserts need not be complicated but can vary (mm the

AEROBICS: TOOTHBRUSH OF THE BODY

By JEAN KING

(Women’l Physical

Few Grinnell coeds get out
and exercise hard enough and
otten enough to be physically
ht. vigorous physical exercise
is needed by everyone —"mutor
moron" or “jock". The most
important parts of the body to
keep in top shape are the heart
and lungs, l.e., the circulatory
and respiratory systems. Aero-
bic exercises—those that talc
the heart and lungs—are a
must.

Dr. Kenneth H. Cooper, auth-

As You Sew, So
Shall You Guiher

By NAN LOWER

There is no ad more insulting
than the one in Which 3 Holly-
wood starlet appears stating.
obnoxiously, the tamiliar
phrase, “It i can sew, you can
sew."

Sewmg is not an adventure
that guarantees a masterpiece
in two hours. it takes time and
patience. Yet even the greatest
eifort cannot succeed unless
one begins with two tunda
mentals: a proper iitting pat
tern and a fabric suitable to the
design.

Today, pattern books can-
sist of two systems of sizing.
The older patterns are those
simply geared to measure-
ments. A general rule for a
girl to iind her size here is to
take one size larger than her
ready-made garment size. This
newer alternative, called “New
Sizing," is the product ol the
industry's awakening to the
problems created by their old
system. This sizing now cop
responds to the manulacturer's
sizes. For example, it one
wears a size 10 in ready-mades,
her old pattern size would be 12
and her new size would be ID.

Simply taking one': measure-
ments and comparing them to
the chart at the back or a pat.
tern book is not enough for a
well-titted creation. Hardly any-
one is a perfect size. Since pat-
terns usually are cut slightly
on the large size, some prob<
items are alleviated. if you an
more than one inch larger, sim-
ply divide the umount by four
and add to the (mm and back
side seams. it is important to
chose to nne's manufactured
size for proper {it of the shoul-
tiers.

whether you be short or long
waisted, lilies are marked on
the pattern pieces to guide one
in adjusting the waist. This is
an important step which too
many forget.

To aid in the selection of
fabric, one can consult the back
of any pattern for a list of
suitable iabric types. General-
ly stated also are those fabric!
which professional cutters hava
found not suitable to the de-
lign. For example, the list
might include plaids or stripes.

Often the choice of proper
patwri'i and fabric, the main
problems or sewing are solved.
Directions in the pattern are
enough to help one begin mak-
ing a well made garment.

On Women:

That's the nature of women
. i . not to love when we love
them, and to love when we
love them not.

Cervantes, Don QuLwio
d-bri-rl—bri-M-

l have said that the religion
preached by Jesus, now totally
extinct in this world, was high
Iy favorable to women. This
was not saying, of course, that
women have returned the com-
pliment by adopting it.

A voluntary interim program
0! independent study which did
not carry academic credit was
offered at Grinnell during the
last ten days of the Christmas
and semester break period lor
the past two years. Last year,
approximately three or four
hundred students registered for
the program, but only 1/, or 1/3
of those registered actually at-
tended. The program was (lis-
continued this year.

The chief difference, besides
length of time, between the 4-1-
4 year and the interim program
is that the 4-14 is a “fully aca-
demic program,” according to
Triplett. Although independent
study in the January term of
the 4-H year would be like the

interim program, it wouuld fo-
cus on special problems that
cannot be handled in regular
course work, the faculty would
still be closely involved, and
credit would still be closely in-
volved, and credit would be
given for such work.

The Student Coordinator plans
to submit a proposal of some
kind to the Executive Council
of the Faculty, after their are
ploratory work is completed, be-
fore the end [if this semester.
They are hoping that there will
be student discussion on the pro-
posal, and that students who
live in communities where there
are colleges currently operating
with a 471—41 program will bring
back information on these pro«
grams alter mid — semester
break. Also, they intend to ques-
tion faculty members on their
reactions to the plan, and how
it might interfere with their
work or scheduling,

The Executive Council of the
Faculty will be the first body
to consider the proposal. The
council consists of the three
division chairmen, the educa-
ti all policy chairmen of each
division, an lat-large faculty
member, the chairman of the
faculty, the Dean of the Col-
lege, and the President. Be-
cause of the failure of the in—
terim session last year, faculty
and administration are doubt-
ful about the program.

President Leggett told the
5&3 that, although he felt that
such a program had a solid
theoretical basis, “after the ex-
perience of last year and the
previous year," he would need
to be persuaded that it. would
work, and “whether the stu-
dents will respond to it.” Free
fessor Morris Parslow, a mem-
ber of the Faculty Committee

on Curriculum which investi-
gated many curriculum pro-
grams last year, expressed sim<
ilar feelings. He saw “no par-
ticular merit in 41-4 as some-
thing new and different" and
considered it mostly as a poor
modification of the interim
program and a “more form»
less way of the old system of
just givmg out credit."

Tom Triplett took the opp0<
site view in arguing int a
change: he views any new in-
dependent study program such
as the 4-1-4 program as a way
to get away from "the unstimu-

lating nature of much of the
current curriculum "

Bicycles Stolen?
Read This

Bicycles are stolen in Grin-
nell at therrate oi 1 or 2 a day.
in most instances, the bicycles
that are stolen have been ridden
away from where they were
parked, and then left anyplace.
The police, when they find
these stolen bikes, will contact
the owner (if the bike is ll-
censed). If it is not, it is put
on the bike rack at the police
station.

Presently there are at least
6 bikes at the station. Some
of these have not even been re
pozted as missing, They will
be left in storage there (at the
Police station) until they are
claimed by the owner.

PR Man, Lawyer

Last spring, the Office of Stu-
dent Coordinator was set up
within Student Government,
with two major functions, to
act as ombudsman for students,
and to provide public relations
for SGA.

In his role as ombudsman,
Thomas Triplett. the Student
Coordinator, and his two as-
sistants. have successfully han-
dled many cases of complaints
from students. ranging from
very simple problems to ones
of major academic concern in-
volving a great deal of investi-
gation. in almost one semester
of operation, only one problem
that has been handled by Trip-
lett’s office has not been solved
to the satisfaction of students —-
Director of Residences Ralph
Pomerenk refused. for safety
reasons, to let the basements
of the Park Street Houses (Con.
lerenoe House, Interracial
House) be used for Pferndactyl
and the Grinnell Drﬂit Infor-
mation Center.

Every other problem ranging
from getting rid of wasps, put—
ting a light on Barber Plaza at
night, and changing the way
art exhibits in the Forum are
selected, to academic problems
involving changes in the edu-
cational policy of the Music De-
partment and changes in facul-
ty rulings on the academic
standings of students handled
by the Student Coordinator has
been solved to the satisfaction
of the complainants. “Nothing
would have happened in most
cases if we hadn't participated
and added the SGA seal," ex-
plains Tom Triplett.

Sports Editorial

By JEFFREY SCHECKTER

The construction of the new, badly needed mum-million dollar
athletlo nomplex will undoubtedly push Grlnnell into a new era
of athletics, at least in the area of physical structures. The largest
segment of Grinnell “athletes,” thoserwha participate in intra-
mural sports, Will gain less than do the varsity teams.

Although exact figures are hard to assemble, approximately
10% or more of the male student body participates in LM. sporu
during the four years here On the other hand, only twenty or
25% are actually involved in intercollegiate, varsity athletic evenm,
Therefore, it is evident than an athletic department at Grinneil
should concentrate at least part of its time and effort on I.M.
sports. No one will deny that pmper training. conditioning, coach-
ing, and equipment are necessary to field a competitive varsity
team. This, of course. takes a great deal of time and expense,
subtracting from the amount available for [M sports.

The current intramural football season is a primary example
of just how unguided the 1M. system is There are ten LM. foot-
ball teams, one from each dorm and the off-campus squad. This
totals about 140 players, or almost three times as many LM.
players as there are on the Ireshman and varsity teams combined.

In spite of the fact that so many students are involved, 1
have never seen any member of the amletic department near a
game. Nor is there any help or aid available to a team.

The true LM. football gama is played by men equipped only
with a few helmets, in an extremely poor state of repair, and
generally lacking in fundamentals or conditioning. Each game has
two student referees with little knowledge of the rules and a tlml~
keeper, usually some trapped spectator. No equipment or medical
aids are available from Darby nor is any person competent in
first aid present

Injuries are common occurrences during I.M. games. They
‘nin from cuts and muscle strains to torn ligaments, shoulder sep-
arationsdnd broken bones. A varsity football player, injured in
a game or practice, has the benefit of prompt attention and tho
whirlpool bath and first aid room at Darby. The Ier football
player is left to his own devices — or those of tho lnfirmary.

It is useless to condemn the present system without offering
another. I therefore propose that the intramural football system
be scrapped entirely or, more realistically, be put under partial
guidance of the athletic department. Good equipment. at least
good helmets, should be made available to all who request them.
One of the referees should be a coach or someone who has
been trained to detect the dangerous infractions of the rules
'which, at present, go on incessantly. in addition, each team should
be able to meet with the coaching staff or a coach to cover the
fundamentals important to safe football.

Without a change in the present LM, system, particularly
football, it is highly likely that a great many more serious in-
juries will occur. It is hazardous and senseless for anyone to con-
tinue to play l.M. sports in their present disorganized manner.
While we are spending money to elevate our stars —- how about
a little something for the common man?

In 1889, twenty-three years

freshman Team Beats Knox 34-20

By KRISTI SCHMITT

The freshmen Pioneers kept
alive s newly—originated winning
tradition by defeating Knox 34.
20 last Friday at Galesburg.
It was the fifth consecutive will
in the last two seasons for the
spunky freshmen

Although Knox was a larger
team in both number and size
(Knox suiting 50 players to our
15), the young Pioneers dealt
them a fierce battle. The team
led in the first quarter and
shocked Knox with two quick
touchdowns, one on a fast
pass to Ed Hizsh and the
other on a Flair pass or
Henry Corona. The next score in
the second period came at the
end of a masterquy engineered
drive by quarterback Bill Dicks
on a sneak from the one yard
line.

The next scoring drive, aid-
ed by the strong arm of Dickl
and his excellent receivers
Jim Plrolll and Ed l-lirsb, was
gained with a quick dive by
fullback Al Hammond from the
one.

Ths defense was spectacular
for the Pioneers in the
first half, with key intercep-
tions by Jim Pirolll and co-
captain Mario Bognanno, whose
interception was returned on a
dazzling run of 7.0 yards. The
defensive stalwarts included
the entire defensive line con-
sisting of Ed Hirsh, Bill Wright,
Doug Watts, Al Hammond and
Scott Hanson. Backing up these
impregnablo five are Mario
Bognanno and Chuck McCeuley.

At the end of the first half,
the Pioneers through their
great aggressive play mistaken-
ly let a deep receiver slip by
and a resulting score occurred.
This was almost too much for
the angry Pioneers, so Knox‘s

'attempt for the point was sty-

mied by the onrush of the entire
defensive line. The score at the
half was Grinnell 28 and Knox
8i

With 30 minutes already un-
der their belts, the Pioneers
charged out on the gridiron

for the second half. But as till
time clicked by almost too
slowly, the sparsely numbered
Pioneer team began to wear
down. In their self-dem-
mined way, they held the re.
latively fresh Knox squad to
minimal yardage and exhibited
great ball control. With the of.
fence being directed by bill
Dicks and the defense by cap-
tains Mario Bognanno and Dave
Cassel, the Pioneers gutted out
the third quarter without or
lowing a touchdown from Knox.
The Pioneers scored still anotha
er touchdown on a pinpoint
pass rifled from quarterback
Dicks to Surehanded Ed l-lirsh.

The fourth quarter was a try-
ing one, with injuries hamperin
the Pioneer squad. Corona a
Bugnanno were out because of
leg injuries, and Wright was
sidelined because of a blow in
the side. With till! great did all- ’
ministered by the Pioneer trahv
or Fat Sam, Wright and Bognan:
no were able to continue action.
Corona, sustaining an injury
that could be serious, sat out tho
rest of the game in hopes he
could recuperate in time to face
Coe at home Oct. 25.

Knox took advantage of this
misfortune on the part of the
Grinneli team to score two
touchdowns in the last period
to raise their standing to mat.
with sheer determination, the
Fmsh held out and the gem.
ended in victory, 34—20.

Harriers Fifth In Cross County

By MICHAEL DALEY

The Grinnell Athletic Depart-
ment sponsored the annual Les
’Duke Cross Country Invitational
Meet on October 5. As in the
pest, great talent and competb
tlon gathered at Grinnell from
the top small colleges in rows.

Although it was overcast and
it hit cool, the participants
turned in fine times on the
grueling Grinnell four mile
course. Despite improved times,
the Grinnell Varsity didn’t finish
as high as coach Ray Ohen-nil-
ier had hoped. The Pioneers
finished a disappointing fifth
behind Lords College, St. Am-
brose, Biackhawk Junior College,
and Graceland College.

Participants in the meet for
Grinnell were Bob Asbille, Rob
Dorsett, Eric Jahn, John Luec—
ke, Tim Power, John Russell,
and John Siekert. With tremen-
dous effort Eric Jahn was able
to finish highest for Grinneii.
Eric improved 2 minutes and 16
seconds over his 1967 time!

Another surprising sophomore,
Tim Power, ﬁnished the d
tapes in 22 minutes and 51 sec-
onds. He has improved almost
2 minutes over last year. The
third of the Big Three sopho-
more was John Russell, who
placed third highest for the
Grinnellians. Russell ran a beau-
tilully paced race.

For the freshmen cross coun-
try team, the Grimeil College
Invitational Meet is the high-
light of the season. This year,
however, the meet lost some of
its excitement for two basic
reasons. First, Drake Universi-
ty freshmen literally ran away
with the meet by taking three
of four top places. Secondly,

. only six of ten expected teams
showed up.

Lynn Lee, of Drake, took ﬁrst
place in a sizzling time of 15
minutes, 45 and 4 tenths see-
onds. Grinneii's own Chuck Mc-
Grath was second, with Phillipa

Watt; ARE
YOU‘ oval PM
(1’2, (r ﬁtitMmiEla

and Sanders, of Drake, captur-
ing third and tourth places re
spectively, Other Big G fresh-
men in the top twenty were
Oscar Rattenborg, eighth place,
Phil Morales, tenth and Mark
Nissen, seventeenth. John
Weins, Chris Decker, and yours
truly, Mike Daley (i linished
dead last) were “also rans."

Drake won team honors with
as points. Loras College was
second with 47 points, Grinneli
was third with 58, and the Uni-
versity at Northern Iowa was
fourth with oz points.

were back in Midwest Confer-
ence action once again on Sat-
urday, Oct. 12, at Knox College,
in Galesburg, Ill. The final score
was decidedly in favor of the
Pioneers, 20-35. Grinnell won,
but the individual times were
generally poor compared to per-
formances in previous meets
this season.

Although he didn’t win, Bob
Dorsett was the exception to
this rule and the standout for
the team. Dorsett crossed the
finish line sixth in 14 minutes
and 14 seconds. This is not a
particularly fantastic time, but
the fact that Rob has slashed
nearly 2 minutes off his time in
two weeks time is outstanding.

Marty Dybicz won the race
for Knox in 22 minutes and 8
seconds. Following Dybicz, Grin-
nell copped the next five places;'
Eric Jahn was second, John
Russell was third, John Siekert
Was fourth, Bob Asbille was
fifth, and Rob Dorsett finished
in sixth place.

With [his victory, the Grin-
nell thinclads evened their con~
ference record at 2.2, They will
travel to Cedar Rapids today to
participate in the cue Invita-
tional. They have dual meets
remaining with Monmouth and
Lawrence and could very likely
finish the season above the .500
mark.

It is Homecoming Weekend
once more and time for my col-
umn to ascend the heights of
lucidity in a glorious effort to
achieve recognition from the
outside world. If i couldn't suc-
ceed last year, however, during
THE weekend of the century, 1
must confess that my hopes are
not bright. (Marshall McLuhan!
Where are you now that I need
you?) It certainly is a condem-
nation oi society that it has
failed to recognize the talent
that is thus for lying dormant
and becoming stagnant in the
confines of an i, M. column.
Come to think of it, maybe the
talent was originally stagnanm

For those of you who haven't
noticed, Stable Field is no long-
er ihere, nor is the baseball
diamond, nor is the soccer field.
Therefore I would suggest that
the people who have been used
to getting their athletic exer-
cise out there be careful not to
fall in front of a road-grader.
Besides, the Des Moines Regis-
ter would probably construe it
as a form of social protest.

i suppose at least some or
you are waiting for l. M. news
so i will attempt to fulfill my
obligation. Dibble has set a
record of some sort by being the
recipient of three forfeits this
year. in the past three years,
there has been only one for-
feit in l. M. football. This is
certainly indicative of a. trend,
or something. The DiirCampus
team Continues to be undefeat-
ed, whcih presents a problem.
Where will they keep the foot-
ball trophy alld who will in-
herit the prize next year? These
are little problems which were
overlooked in the overhauling
of the campus system. Just
think, where would we all be
without a sociological commen-
iator like myselt? (Nirvana?)

Pioneers Mount lniured Squadron
Againsi Beloit Brown in Home Game

By REGGIE GRAHAM

Tomorrow at 1:00 pm. the
Pioneers face Beioit here for
our annual homecoming game.
Beloit goes into the game with
three wins in tour games. Grinv
hell’s only Victory out of four
chances was against Knox.
That victory came last Satur-
day, and it should boost the
team’s spirit during the follow-
ing week. The Pioneers are
tired of losing and the momen‘
tum irom the Knox game could
be a factor tomorrow.

There aren't many players on
the Beloit squad this year, but
Coach Bowers says that they
are all capable players. They
are 3150 big, with the starting
lineman and backs averaging
almost two hundred pounds.
They have two good quarter-
backs, one of whom is an eX‘
cellent passer with a tendency
to complete the long bomb. 0n
the receiving end, Whipple, a
split 5 n d wearing number
thirteen, will be a constant
threat to our pass defense.
Young, number thirtyrthree,
is supposed to be “as good a
back as any in the conierence,"
according to Bowers; his run-
ning ability has gained him the
number six spot on the list of
the high scorers in the confer-
ence,

on the Grinnell side, Gary
Johnson, ollr starting sopho<
more quarterback, has been
doing a iine job. Each game
he does better and his passing
has improved tremendously (7
out of 12 complete at Knox with

no interceptions). Jon Buswell,
senior fullback, is beginning to
get back into his best form, and
should do very well tomorrow.
Jon was second string all con-
{erence in 1966, with a total of
383 yards on the ground to his
credit. Brian Barnes is another,
player who should do well to-
marrow. Brian is a senior half-
back; last year in thirtyrfoul
attempts he averaged thre'
yards per carry. Tom Lower
has played very well in the last
two games, as has Steve
Hutchings, and they are both in
good shape for the defensive
part of the game tomorrow.
John Winterson has proven his
ability as a receiver quite a few
times this year; he and Gary
Jones will be looking for
passes. Don Kraitsik has been
doing a fine job and should be
playing tomorrow despite re-
cent injuries. Roy Lewis, a
sophomore back, has shown
what a capable runner he is,
but has been plagued by in-
juries. Al Cloud probably won’t
be playing against Beioit due
to a severe knee injury, but
until he received the injury he
was having a great season.

Even though some valuable
players haven’t completely re<
coveted yet, most of the in-
juries received in the game
three weeks ago have healed.
The team is in good shape and
the spirit is great. it we can
show the determination we had
at Knox, and play as well as we
did at Ripon, tomorrow's game
will prove to be an excellent
battle.

 

Slaie U’s Seek More Grinnell Games
As Soccer Club Displays Varsity Level

By YVOR STDAKLEY

John Hemingway, student-
coach of the Grinnell soccer
team, said on Monday that
contacts were being made with
the University of Iowa and
Iowa State University to try to
arrange games with the two
schools before the end of this
season.

Coach nemingway said that
U of I, impressed with Grinr
nails 5 t r o n g performance
against them two weeks ago,
contacted the club by phone.
So far, scheduling arrange-
ments have not been agreed
upon. The club is also trying to
secure a date with lowa State.
One of the complications in this
effort is that Grinnell's team is
a club rather than a varsity
sport.

Thus far in the season, the
Pioneers have won three
games, deleaung Cornell twice
and Carleton once. and dropped
two, a 2-1 decision to Knox and
a 32 contest to the Universrty
of Iowa.

Conch Hemingway feels that
the season has been satisiying
so far. He notes that the great-
est improvements over last
year have been team spirit,
pride, and a real desire to win.
He feels that in spite of the
talent on last year’s squad,
these important qualities were
lacking.

“The guys have shown real
good contidcnces," he come
mented. “They show up for
practices and take the respon-
sibility of staying in condition
upon themselves. As a student-
coach, I can only make sugges—
tions. The responsibility is
theirs."

Looking forward to next year,
the Pioneers should be in real
fine shape. The team will only
lose two players in graduation
— Dave North and Ray Hil-
horn. While their loss will defi-
nitely he felt, Coach Heming-
way hopes that the experience
gained this season by the five
freshmen in the lineup will take
up the slack.

Should soccer become a var-
sity sport in the Midwest Colle-
giate Conference next year,
Grinnell's Pioneers should be
stmng contenders for its first
Crown.

Girls’ Hockey Team
Graces Graceland,

By CINDY ROOT

Graceland College was the
scene of a scoreless day for
the girls’ field hockey team.
Grinnell met Graceland in tho
first round, and neither team
could sneak one by the goalies,

until Graceland whacked one in
with five minutes left to go in
the second half. Poor stickwork
and control slowed the game
down considerably, and proved
quite frustrating to those mem-
bers on the team who have
some idea of what good clean
hockey really is. Although Grim
neil had many chances to score,
we lacked that extra something
that makes a winning team. it
was a dlsllppointlng, but de-
served loss. Maybe now we’ll
get some girls out to practioexr
we obviously need itl

Our second round match was
against Central Missouri State,
who, with their accurate passes
and good stickwork, spurred
out team on to really fight, and
finally we almost clicked. Cathy
Ellis and Marcia David played
superbly on defense, helped by
Narda Cisco and Nancy Eetz,
who were quite effective in
breaking up many of Missouri’s
pass patterns. Goalie Connie
Bcnham, in her typical, res
laxed manner, saved anything
that happened to penetrate this
hard working defense. The for-
wards also made a lot of good
breaks, but couldn’t quite get
the ball in the cage.

We're fired now, though, and
after we shake the kinks from
our muscles, we will be a lot
better tuned for our final home
game against Drake on Thurs<

both teams agreed to play off
the draw. The score remained
even after two five-minute
overtlmes, forcing the game
into ’sudden death’ (the first
team to score wins).

The Pioneer's spurred by the
thought of last year’s humilia<

Dave North, left wing for the
Pioneers, scored on an assist
from Korstnd early in the first
half. Bruce Graham booted his
5th goal of the season to put
Gi'inneli ahead 2-0. Carleton
scored twice with a strongly
overloaded ielt side to make it
2-2.

John Videtich, Substituting

pass from Korstad and scored
a key goal to give the Pioneers
a 3-2 edge at halftime.
