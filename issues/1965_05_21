Cui Next Year

Grinnell College's Program in
Practical Political Education will
undergo a budget out next year or
nearly 50%, according to Acting
President James Stauss.

The Cut, from about $14,000 to
37,500, results tram the expiration
‘oi a Falk Foundation grant which
had supported most or the program
in the past years.

c. Edwin Gilmour (political
science), who has headed the pro-
gram, said he is ”not. pessimistic”
about the future or the program.
The cut, said Gilmour, will elim-
inate the summer political intern-
ship. There Will be a politician in
residence next year, though.

 

 

Students Demonstrate Dilemma
As 'Forgotten Men’ in Education

By Anna Fun-er

Apparently operating under the
assumption that the lBM card 0!
today is the demonstrator of to-
morrow, students across the v.5.
have been sitting in and spouting
oit to demonstrate their plight as
“the iorgoiten mail" in American
education.

They illustrate their situation
with facts such as Association for
Higher Education’s lengthy report
concerning preparation or college
administrators which did not once
mention the word Student and
statements such as Mario Savio's
(The Berkley man) “The university
is well-structured, well-tooled, to
turn out people with all the sharp
edges worn all, the well-rounded
person.”

Grievances and gripes against
“the system" chielly seem to in-
clude the bigness at schools, lsck
Ol‘ concern for the student, and
taculty neglect or undergraduate
teaching: but students have
searched their tortured undergrad-
uate souls, acting to the fullest of
their existenial potential, and
vented their new found intellectual
purpose (or otneriness as the case
may he) in incidents ranging irom
demonstrations in defense of mod-
erii poetry in Oregon to the idealis-
tic and gastric establishment of
the Students for Justice to SAGA
Employees at the State University
of New York.

Some experts see the rebellion
against the tnctory system at edu-
cation as a little lrog in the big
contemporary puddle ot the civil
rights struggle. Mario Savio

were George Kahin, protessor at

From thEir talks one major ques-

or communism and Peking power.

Undoubtedly. an academic study
of Federico Garcia Lorca's Yel'lllﬂ
would reveal a wealth of cultural
and psychological insights. But the
play. as presented in Roberts
Theatre last weekend, lacked any
real signiiicance.

Everything in the play, it seemed
revolved around Yerma's desire to
have a child—and without an un~
derstanchng ot the importance or
such a desire within Yermu's par-
ticular ellVlornment. the action as
a whole lacked motivation and im-
portance. In other words, there
didn't Seem to be any "universals"
to abstract from Yerma's dilem-
ma.

Technically, the play was quite
well done, William Sherman's set
was stark, simple, and very sym-
bolic. The snatches oi music, com-
posed by Burrlll Phillips, were ei-
lectlve, anti Ned Donahoe‘s direc-
tion made the most of an unnatural
sciipt. The concept oi providing

 

“bleachers" along the sides or the
stage for the actors not involved
in a particular scene was rather
interesting.

Sile Monto’s interpretation or the
title role was generally convincing
~her expression and movement
were often excellent. But the one
mistake she did make was to start
out at too high a pitch, Miss Mon-
‘to's pleading came with her very
' first line, resulting in a one-dimem
slonal speech pattern which was
alien tiresome to listen to.

Juan and Victor, played by Terry
McCoy and tell Garland, were both
a hit weak. McCoy had good move-
ment and inflection, but lacks a
voice which can easily be pm~
jected. Garland has a tremendous
stage voice, but was inexpressive
and slilled.

Two of the more effective ac-
tresses were Deb Davis and Deb
Burnstinet Miss Davis was one of

 

the livelier characters on stage.

portrayal of the pagan crane very
etiectively.

Tanya novanessian and Carl
Dugan were generally good in their
roles, though they tended to b-
somewliat inconsistent.

in general, the entire cast and
crew worked well within the con-
lines or a script which must hava
been diliicult to interpret. it the
play dragged in spots, it also had
its enjoyable moments, such as

Netmen Finish Second to Carleton
In Conference Meet at Monmouth

Grinnell‘s varsity netmen came
through in top form at the con-

end in Monmouth, Overall, the Pin-
neers scored 14 points to edge
Ripon with 13, and Lawrence with
ll. Carleton won, as expected,

with it] points

Grinnell clinched second place in
the last match of the tournament
when the Pioneers‘ second doubles
team of Mike Greenﬁeld and Ken
Clymer defeated Carleton for the
conference title. Greenfield and
nymer, playing their best tennis
of the year, beat the Carls 7.5,
(H.

The final match was played in
near perfect form by both teams.
There were only four service
breaks in the two sets, three to
Grinnell’s advantage.

Before beating Carleton. Clymer
and Greenfield had set back Be-
loit 6-4, (H. after a shaky start.
They then went on to defeat St.
Olaf 673, 6-4 in the semifinal
match. clymer and Greenfield had
been defeated last year by the
same St. Olaf team in the confer.
ence tournament.

Another highlight of the tourna—
ment was the success of Pioneer
Larry Shannon. Shannon, seeded
fourth, played in the number one
spot. Playing erratically as he has
most of the season, Shannon near-

 

ly lost his opening match to Mead

of Cornell, ﬁnally winning Z~6, 7»5,
6»).

Shannon then settled down and
played close to his potential in de-
feating Cooper of Lawrence, who
had drawn the number two seen,
276, 6-2, 6-2. Shannon met Doug An'
kerson of Ripon in the final match
at 7:30 in the evening. Ankerson
had just defeated highly touted
(and cocky) Jev Sikes of Carleton
in the most exciting match of the
day.

Ankerscn defeated Shannon 6‘1,
6-], but the Pioneers had an \meXr
pected second place at No. l sin-
gles.

Mike Greenfield at No. 2 singles,
was seeded second to Jim Keenan
of Carleton. That was the way it
finished. In his first match. Green-
field defeated his Beloit opponent
6-3, 6-2, He made short work of
his second opponent 6-4, 672 before
losing to Keenan in the final
match 53, 6-4.

Lige Hicks scored points for the’
team at No. 4 singles and also at
No. l doubles. Hicks defeated his
Monmouth opponent ea. 64) hefore
losing to Carleton in the semi-ﬁnal
round 6-2, 673.
