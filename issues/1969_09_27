The purpose or Younker
Memorial Health Center is to
provide “limited treatment oi
students requiring short-term
care,” not to treat serious
physical or mental disorders,
Dean Joseph F. Wall told some
ion persons gathered in South
[nudge Tuesday night

Wail presided at a special
meeting called by President
Glenn Leggett to present
evidence, answer questions. air
grievances and squelch ialso
rumors about the Health Cen-
ter. Also participating were
Deans Alice Low and Waldo S.
Walker, and Mrs. irma N. Hall,
Administrative Supervisor at
the Health Center.

in reply to complaints that
students are not getting their
money's worth at the Health
Center, the deans pointed out
that the college spends 58 thou-
sand dollars for the Health Cen-
ter's operationrand a contri-
bution to the Jasper and
Poweshiek County mental
health clinic, although students
pay a total or only $51,795, Stu-
iients pay an individual health
tee at $45 annually.

Despite student complaints
about poor service at the Health
Center, the deans and Mrs. Hall
insisted that the “before-the-
chtor comes" service oliered
it the Health Center is
adequatet Dr. David Fergusonr
a consulting physician to the
Health Center who was present
It the meeting, said that he
believes the nurses have per-
formed their duties well.

Part,0f the problem, the
meeting revealed, is that the
health Center is currently un-
derstatied. Four nurses are
normally employed in addition
to Mrs, Hall. However, one
nurse resigned last summer,

 

and still another resigned last
week following what the deans
called “stress and tension" due
in part to student complaints
Mrs. Hall has been serving as
an on-duty nurse 47 hours a
week because of the vacancies.
She said the college is making
efforts to fill the vacancies, but
has encountered much dithculty.

The possibility of hiring an
in-residence physician for the
Health center was also dis.

cussed. Ml‘si Hall, Dr. Ferguson, >

and the deans all said that such
a plan would not be feaSlhlo
due to the difficulty or attract-
ing qualliied physicians. ,

Several students asked Mrs.
Hall to explain what sort of
treatment Health Center nurses
are permitted to administer.
She said that she could more
easily say what they cannot
do—inake diagnoses or give in<
jectable drugs. “In other words,
we Can’t practice medicine,”
she added,

Walker agreed to study the
possibilities oi reinstating an
inrresidence clinical psychologist
upon the suggestion at student
senator Bill Thomas, who is a
member 01 a senate committee

investigating student complaints '

about the Health Servicet
Walker warned that increased
health service might increase
health lees. thus increasing the
likelihood of a homogeneous
student body.

Walker also agreed to investi-
gate the possibility of replacing
the current health insurance
plan that covers accidents only
with a Blue Cross-Blue Shield
plan.

Thomas announced that any
lurther student question or
Complaints about the Health
Center should be directed to his
senate committee.

Some ten to fifteen students

Fortini Sales Tax

The Forum Grill this morn-
ing began charging a a per cent
sales tax on all purchases over
14 cents. A recent ruling by the
Iowa Tax Commission removed
the retail sales tax exemption
on sales in the Forum Grill
and the Private Dining Rooms.

Previously, the college ‘had
been granted a sales tax ex-
emption because oi its status
as an' educational institution.
However, the recent ruling
ordered that Grill sales must
he taxed because they are not
directly related to the college’s
educational operations.

The tax commission is cur-
rentiy considering removal or
the sales tax exemption on
board fees paid to the college.
Should the commission rescind
the exemption, the college
may take the matter to court,

according to Donald Lambie, ‘

of the college.

 

LEGGETI: CAN'T

“The drug situation is very
involved, and clarity is not as
easy as in other areas," Presl-
uent Glenn Leggelt told several
hundred Grinnellians gathered
in South Lounge last night to
hear a panel discussion about
the president’s recent drug pole
icy statement. “it is impossible
for us to say, ‘It you act this
way, this will happen ' Leg-
get sent],

The president indicated last
night that student drug users
who seek counselling cannot be
pos=ive that “confidentiality

lege.

“I think we have the Iype or
counsellors who will respect

confidentiality, but nobody can
guarantee it," he said. “The
evidence might be so revealing
that the conscience of a mem-
ber of the discussion group with

set up procedures by which a

The drug statement which was
called ”ambiguous" by Iowa
Attorney General Richard Tiir<

the college will not “decide
whether evidence oi drug use

Leggelt last night_reiterated
that the drug statement is

,“vei‘y imperfect” and is ”sub-

the drug problem the college
must consider is obligations to

Cops Question Student in Drug Case

Grinnell police last week
questioned a junior at the col-
lege “about making marijuana
available to a minor," accord-
ing to Grinneil Chief of Police
C. W. “Bill” Peters, No charges
have been filed against the stu-
dentr

He was questioned as
part of a police investigation oi
a case involving a 17 year old
high school student suspected
of marijuana possession Peters
said that the youth’s mother
last week turned over to police
a quantity of marijuana she
had found hidden in his room.

Because the youth is a minor,
he cannot be charged with pos-
session ot marijuana, Peters
said. “However, we can the an
open charge of delinquency,"
the police chief added.

The college student, who
claims no knowledge as to why
he was implicated in the case,
gave this account to the 5&3;

Cowles around 3 am. Saturday
morning when Peters and out
car Larry Ray, both in uni-
form, came into my room and
woke me up. I'm pretty much
Convinced they didn't knock,
and they never produced a
search warrant. They made no
etiort to iniorin me oi my con.
stitutional rights at that time,
and i knew nothing oi the na-
ture of the charge or ii there

“They said that they had
tried to reach me by phone and
implied that i hurl been trying
to avoid them. They said that
they wanted me to come down
to the police station at one

 

 

o'clock, and that if I didn't
they could get legal machinery
in operation. Their tone was
brusque, as though I was pre-
sumed guilty of something.

“i asked them what the whole
thing was all about, but they
would only say that i would
find out at one o’clock. Feters
told me, ‘1'“ break a leg to be
there at one, so you better be
there}

“When I went to the station
at one, Peters immediately in-
rurmed me of my rights, I told
him I didn't know what he
wanted me tor, and he said.
‘Don't play dumb; i want to
talk to you about marijuana.‘

“Peters told me that a high
school kid had been busted and
had given police my nama.
Peters asked' if I had sold to
the kid, and i said no. He ask-
ed ii i had ever smoked, and
I took the fifth

”Then he wanted to know the
names of any iriends i may or

My sen . oi discouragement
does not stem from the work of
the EPC icself, In fact, this
committee who a perfect model
0f just how Constructive and
fruitful studentriaculty com-
mittees can be. We carefully
consider numerous education is-
sues, and our voting by no
means pitted faculty against Stu.-
dents. The committee members,
eager to pursue a substantial
ogcndu we set for ourselves, cir-
culated poshon papers, motions,
and amendments. We nlet prac-
tically every week, and we kept
in'contact with the faculty and
student constituents whom we
represented.

Much of the EPC’s time was
dcvoied to considering compre-
hensive examinations, The elk
max of our work was a vote on
this iollowmg student-initiated
motion:

“The EPC proposes that com-
prehensive examinations for sen—
iors should be eliminated as a
general college requirement.
Since the Spemfie ideals of calm
pi'chensive learning will vary
with the department, the deci-
sion as to the existence and
nature of an examination (scmi-
liar or project) to accomplish
these ideals. should be_left to
the dcpur'cillcnt and should be
decided with student participa-
tion and some thought to the
students' lnrlh’ldual needs."

ed many weeks of thought on
the issue and was, we felt, the
only realistic solution to the
problcln oi what to do with
coinprcncnsivc exams,

The rest of the story is dis
couragin; and has led me to
question the worth of student—
faculty committees, Our dc '-
sion on comprehensive or his
(the study of iiliieli hall been res
quested of us by the executive
council) and a few of our other
recommendations were submit-
ted to the executive council for
consideration, According to Dr.
Joseph D. Danioi’th, last year’s
chairman of the Science EFC,
sonic effort was necessary to
urge the executive council even
to acknowledge receipt of our
recommendations. Nevertheless,
the minutcs of one of last year's
council meeting formally show
receipt of our proposals. How-
ever, the executive council ap-
parently never even looked at
what we suggested, Our efforts
died in the executive council,

1 am told that the council was
swamped with work, and i do
not doubt that they were. But
I will not accept that as an ex-
cusc for ignoring our commit-
tee's recommendations. This was
not any committee: it was a
studentrfaculty committee. If
the college truly Wanted to
show that students could have
a meaningful voice in school
decisions, it could have found
time to consider the EPC’s pro-
posals.

This year 1 am again a dele-
gate to the Science EPC. This
committee has again been i
structed to study comprehen.
sive exams. So again we will go
through the long deliberations
about the issue, (or ihc ten peo<
pic on the commiiocc, only two
were members last year and are
therefore aware at what trans.
pii-cd then). i wonder wheth-
cr this is just a game we are
playing. Docs our committee
really have any purpose?

Maybe this time our recoln<
mend‘dtioiis will he considered,

ol whom (at least in ihc Scicnco
Division) were led to believe

 

that changes in comprehensive

Student (all For
A Vietnam Moratorium

(The Vietnam Moratorium, n series at national, escniuﬂnt
antiwar actions, will begin October 15. Students at more than 54»
colleges are already committed to spending the day in ma com-
munity with door-ioduor campaigns. teach-ins, rallies and vlgilI.,

Accompanying the campus-based actions will be organized at-
Iorts by businessmen, clergymen, community groups and lubim
All activities are directed against United state: action in Vietnam.

The Moratorium has the endorsement oi the National Ameri-
cans for Democratic Action, the Natlonal Student Association, the
New Mobilization Committee, and tho National Democratic Coali-
tlon.

The bellowing “Student call” has been signed by some 50!
college student body presidents and campus newspaper editors.
A faculty call is being written. The Grlnnell student senate err
dorsed the Vietnam Moratorium last Tuesday and allocated fluids
in a Moratorium committee oi the senate and the Grinnell Slu-
deut Movement.)

Ending the war in Vietnam Is the most important task racing
the American nation. Over the last few years, millions of Ameri-
cans have campaigned, protested. and demonstrated against the
war. Few now defend the war, yet it continues. Death and des-
truction are unabated; bombs and fire continue to devastate
South Vietnam. Billions 01 dollars are spent on war while the ur-
gent domestic problems of this country remain unattended. More-
over, the war has liad a corrupting inﬂuence on every aspect of
American life, and much of the national discontent can be
traced to It! influence.

The discredited policies of the past which have brought about
this American tragedy have not been changed, We Iollovv the
same military advice which has created a futile and bloody con-
flict while we cling to tho same policies which have caused the
Paris negotiations to Taller. The token displacement of 25,000
troops over a three month period simply is not the substantial
change in policy that is so desperately needed.

Thus it is necessary for all those who desire peace to be-
come active again and help bring pressure to bear on the present
administration.

We call for a periodic moratorium on "business as usual” in
order that students, faculty members and concerned citizens can
dcvolc time and energy to the important work of taking me issue
of peace in Vietnam to the larger community.

If the war continues this fall and there is no firm commit-
menl [0 American Withdrawal or a negotiated settlement on OCLO‘
ber ls, participating members of the academic community will
spend the entire day organizing against the war and working in
thecommu .uy to get others lo join us in an enlarged and length»
ened moratorium in November. This process \Vill continue until
there is American withdrawal or a negotiated settlement.

We call upon all membem oi the university community to
Support the moratorium, and we commil ourselves to organize
this ciiori on our campus and in the larger communiiy. We ask
others to join us.

ever, is one of spending several
tells of thousands oi dollars to
expand physically the basement
oi Carnegie on the east side.

I am dubious about this for
the following reasons:

(I) I think this sort of ex-
pansion is bound to be ugly. i
can think of nothing which
could be done to the outside of
an expanded basement which
would conceal the fact that the

of ccniracoug ihc College has
gotten in recent years, that the

New Day Cdre Center Opens

By Molly~ McGuire

Since a woman's place cannot always
be in the home, a day care center has
been opened to provide Grinnell pre-
Iehoolers with a place to stay while their
mothers are oft on such undomestic pur~
runs as working or going back to school.

The Grinnell Community Day Caro
Center, in operation [or only two weeks,
l5 located in the basement of the First
United Presbyterian Church at 1015 Filth
Avenue, Having a capacity oi twenty
children, from three to six years old, the
center is open six days a week, it is re-
lying heavily on student, volunteer help,
and more is needed. ‘

The idea of a day care center was
first promoted by the United Church

'Women, a. general council of Grinnell

women. After a survey of the town last
year. they found that there was a defi-
nite need for this type of service. Many
women who wanted to work or return to

- school Idund lt difﬁcult to afford a baby-

iittel‘ for'thelr preschool children.

After realizing the need tor a center,
a board consisting of members of the
community at large was formed. The
project then went out of the hands of the
Church Women and became a communi-
ty project, with people irom all walks or
life contributing to the realization of the
center.

 
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Although it is helped financially by the
United Fund, much or the center’s equip-
Grinnell. A gift of $600 from the office
of President Glenn Leggett is being used
to help pay the rent for this year. Vol-
unteer workers readied the basement of
the church, usually used for Sunday
School, into a child's playroom roll at
games, _toys, andtricycles.

The day care center is more than at

 

glorified babysitting agency. Mrs.
Charles Seller, director of the center an?
ment was donated by townspeople o
a tormer elementary school teacher, has
many “body and mind-developing” acti.
vities planned for the Children, Includlu
ed in a day’s activities are educational
“study" periods in areas like art, simple
science and number readiness, exercise.
and a noon meal followed by nap-time,

Although it has room for twenty chil-
dren, only 12 have enrolled so far. The
fee is on a Sliding scale of $14 per day,
depending on the family’s financial state.

So tar, although there is still a shortage
of equipment and Volunteers, bath the
children and the townspeople seem happy
with the center. The next fund drive
should reveal any dissenting males, it
there are any, who Still feel that math-
ers should stay at home, regardless o
the need or desire to work or go to
school.

(a) i suspect that it will not
be many more years before the
College will have to put up at
least one more new building on
campus, at which time the Book
Store may be able to secure
much larger quarters than it
could get through the proposed
expansion. 11, for example, a
common dining hall is put up
near Darby, as was earlier-
lanned beiore funds grew short
t may well include a larger and
more cor‘venient mail room and
consirerably larger Book
tore in its design.

H such a building were erect
ed, further, the present Cowles
dining space could be reconveru
ed to dormitory space, and then
perhaps some or all of Younk~
ers could be remodeled for ad—
ministrative ottices. Younkers
is not integrally connected to
the other north dorms, and is
in a good spot for ottices. ,

Such a move would leave
much more room in the Library.
then, for the Library, which is
now so short oi space as to have .
removed the older periodical
volumes to the oiiice building
downtown. The basement of Car—
negie could then be remodeled r
for new faculty offices. it, at '
any rate. new permanent build
ing will have to be undertaken
soon anyway, then a permanent
solution to the Book Store’s
problems may not be tar off.
without our having to tamper
with Carnegics basement. . ' ,

(4) It, More more perma—;
nent building plans can he im-
plemented, expansion of the
Book Store simply must be at-
rected, I think there are other,
ways oi achieving this, For ex:
ample, it the new gym is un-
ished next year, and the Wo<
men’s Physical Education Dew
partment is moved there irom
the Women’s gym tiie mail rooni .
might be moved into the wom;
en’s gym. This would make use;
oi tloor space that is ditiicrilt
to use tor most purposes, since
the walls do not appear strong
enough to support a great deal
of weight (so that i doubt that
the Book Store itself could he
moved into the women's gym).
The Book Store could then have
the present mail room to llse'
either as storage space or as a
second display room.

Or, it the new swimming pool
is the tirst part of the new
gym to be completed. the old
swimming pool could be used to .

house the mail room, perhaps, '. ,

so that the Book store could.
again have the present mail ,
room; or perhaps the Book Store ‘
could better use the old swim-V
mirig pool building itselt, after ,
the old pool was covered or .

Surely some space will be op-
ened up as the new gym is com- ,
pleterl that will allow either
the mail room or the Book store
to move and ease the problem
temporarily, _ :

It seems to me possible, at
any rate, to assist the Book
Store next year without
Carnegic’s dammit

“Anybody who saw the infor-

and it would be contempt of
court punishable by fine or im-
prisonment if he did not," said
Bierman. “Then it would ha
morally up to the person in-
volved whether or not the cone
ﬂdential relationship could be
respected." /

During a question period,
many students condemned the
administration for disciplining
student drug users. “Discipli—
nary action isn’t going to help
a thing,” asserted one coed,
who said that the deans placed
her on social probation after
she suffered an adverse reac-
tion from mescaline. "Threat-
ening people dosn’t change
them, it just makes them more
deiensive."

When asked directly “why
the college should ever disci.
pline drug users,” Dean Alice
Low passed the question on to
Leggett. Alter hedging tor a
few moments, Leggett repliedi
“I think it may be an institu-
tional responsibility to disci-
pline student drug users in
some cases, because we have
obligations to Diher students
who maybe atiected (by his
drug use). and because it may
be that a pusher pr hard-core
user Should be out of the in-
stitution to save its reputation."

Panel member Robert D.
Gray, an instructor in political

science. laid that his “omos
tlonal reaction" to the drug sit-
uation Is that the college should
“get away from in loco paren-
tis completely and say, ‘Lonk.
if you want to indulge in illegal
behavior, go ahead . , . but
you may bet caught’.” How-
ever, Grey continued, “The
college can't do that because
if there is a bust and many
of you (students) get arrested
. . . it may very well destroy
the institution.”

“I‘m looking for solutions,
but I can’t come up with
any basic ones," Grey said.
“We can’s stop you from tak-
ing drugs. and we can't stop
the authorities from eniurcing
the law. That. leaves me Where
President Leggett is — there
can be no clear policy." Grey
also criticized what he Called
“the punitive nature” of parts
or the drug statement.

Student panel member Tom
Thomas, a senior, criticized ”a
preventative, punitive, enforc-
ing drug policy” which he be
lieved “m utu ally exclusive
from a positive counselling pol-
icy.

“! don't think any kind of
drug policy is going to lessen
the likelihood of a bust,” Thom-
as asserted. “A drug education
program that would lessen .the

chance oi students adversely -

affecting themselves is an area
where the college can play a
positive role.”

Thomas also criticized a
counselling system that pre—
sumes drug users are damag-

ing themselves. “In neithu
realistic in terms of positiv.
results on the user nor in term:
of medical and psychological ‘
evtdence." he said. Thomas also
advocated that the college con.
cern itself with student dru

use only when it affects ace;

‘ demic perlormance.

“It isn’t clear what kind nl
drug users the college wants t
not against,” commented senlo
Carol Holton. the other studen
member of the panel. "It's kins
oi disgusting that nothing mord
can be spelled out.”

The panel, moderated by Pro-
fessor John Worley (Philosor
phy), was the first of a' series
of discussions on campus issues.
Future panels are scheduled tor
Wednesdays at 7:30 in South
Lounge.

Other comments by Leggett
at last night’s discussion:

7“Tlle college has an obliga-
tion to persuade hard-core drug
users that thay’ra harming
themselves?

—“Most of us do not want the
Institution to become a haven
for drug users.”

—“Sometimes I think ihaf
publication at my statement
guarantees a bust. . . It is real.-
ly an'internal document.”

—“The complete vacating of
the in loco parentis syndrome at
this time is impossible . . . Th6
college can’t conserve its inc
tegrity unless it shows some
concern for student welfare
which involves some meddling!g

By MARK GRAESER

To all them psuedo—sophistl-

ales on the east and west
hinges of our beloved country,
town is an uninterrupted waste
of crewcuts. condields, and
Imelly bums.

Grinnell. it seeml, ls suito-

ating in anonymity, a pearl

ast adrift in a sea of swine.

t can't even boast of a tar-

ished image in the east and
host; it has virtuauy no image
ht all to scores of high school
[tudents outside the Midwest.

All this information is to in-
troduce the heroes of the soon~
to-be—solved crisis: Jim Hormel
and Milt Bellows of Campbell
Films.

These gentlemen are making
I recruiting film for the Ad.
missions Office to be shown on
both commercial and educa<
{loual television, and in high
schools throughout the country.

The film will be in color, 281/2
minutes long, of general inter-
Qst and painstaking honesty —
that's an encapsulated view 0!
the ﬂick as expressed by Hor-
hiel in a recent interview with
the 58:3. The film has a dual
purpose! to acquaint prospec»
tive students with the idea oi
the ”small liberal arts institu-
tion," and to show Grinnell in
Its uniqueness.

“One thing we are selling

quite hard is the concept of
going on with your education
and how the small liberal arts
school is one option in that
continuity," said Hormel.
“Then beyond that we are fo-
cusing on those iactors that
make Grinnell different,"

Frequently, the iilming or
movies for college; has been
undertaken solely for the pur-
pose of soliciting alumni dona-
tions. The truth in such flicks
is often lost, or at least mis-
laid, Even Grinnell has had a
bad trip along those lines. A
movie made for AIM (Academ-
ic improvement Masterplan)
and shown at Various fund rais-
ing gatherings, was shown to
students, who found it had the

low. It seems the movie

students studying (mooing?)
conientedly under trees. and
couples walking hand in hand
down the railroad tracks to-
ward the sunset.

The new ﬁlm ought to be a
very different plum—less sweet,
but much easier to swallow.

“The primary requirement of
the film is honesty," said Hor-
mel. “We will be dealing with
students in this rum, and it
you’re going to try to do that
you've got to be honest. You
just can't get away with the

kinds of things that used to be
done in college movies. People
just don't go ior that bullshit
any more.”

“It is going to be an honest
movie,” assured Director of
Admissions Dale a. Terry. “We
have to be able to show it to
the student body without being
embarrassed."

Hormel and Bellows left Grin-
nell yesterday after only iii-
teen days oi shooting. How can
one get to know a place well
enough in such a short period
or time to portray it honestly?

It is not an easy task to be
sure, but both men — although
young —— have had much expe-
iience in making movie. or
this kind. They have made
films on Amherst, Bucknell,
Colby, Williams, Middleoury,
and eleven or twelve others.

They go to a college with a
conception of how to quickly
learn what and why things oc-
cur. They learn who is consid-
ered to be the most articulate
spokesman tor the rlght as well
as the left. They extract opin-
ions and all shades of student
thought. They speak to dean!
and faculty as well, principally
for background information.

“You just can't find out what
a place is like by talklng to the
president of the school. You’ve
got to speak to students," Hor-
mel pointed out.

The real key to findlng out
"what Grinnell is all about,"
Hormel said, “is to learn
where to put you'le faith. We
put our faith in students.”
Cynics among us may aver
that the collage can uiiord to
’let some things be said, out
they would never allow
(gasp!) complete honesty! Hon-
rnel denies that this is true. He
and Bellows were hired. he said,
without a script. They were
hired to come to Grinnell and
answer on film these questionsl
Why do students come hero'P.
Why do they stay? What is

good here?
What is bad?

“Our function here has been
to investigate and recommend,
not carry out orders," Hormel
stated.

All the film has been shot
for the movie, and now they
take it hack to Saans River.
Vermont, where they will edit
it. It is they who decide what
stays in and what goes, Hers
mel said. But what i! the Ad-
missions Ofﬁce finds something
terribly offensive in the final
product? “They gave their ap-
proval to everything we shot
at the time we did It, I just
don’t see the possibility of that
happening."

if the final product reflect.
Hormel's impressions of Grins
nell, as it no doubt will, there
is llttle for the Admissions 0f-
flce to worry about. He is quite
impressed with the place.

“Grinnell is as impressive a
place as I've ever been. it in
really exceptional,

“The most outstanding thing
about it ls the amount of tal-
ent that exists here. At Mid-
dlebury, an orchestra can’t
even be maintained because of
a lack of talent. but Grinnell
has a fine one.

“The ideal of the liberal arts
education seems to be much
more of a reality here than at
most places. Students seem not
to specialize so much here.
but may have diverse interests.
For instance, people who aren't
journalism majors work on the
newspaper, athletes get in.
volved in student government,
and so forth.

“One of the most impressive
things about Grinnell has been
the way students reacted to
the cameras. You can tell a
lot about the sophistication of
students that way. Like at a
little all women’s college in the
east where once the girls get
in from of the camera they
start giggling and waving at

Technically, the movie wlll
be mostly in “synch,” that is
the actuality of an event will
be preserved, but the ”voice
over" dubbing technique will
also be used. This involves
showing footage of a scene
while tapevrecorded segment!

Sleep-In Bombs

By Kay Carlson

it was a clear, cool night on
Mac Field. The stars twinkling
down tor the Saga Sleeprln
were dismayed at the scarcity
or souls below. Who would reap
of the wisdom they poured from
the heavens?

Only seven Individuals had
stayed after the initial attrac—
tion of the artificial llicker of
Laurel and Hardy and atter
Saga Chuck’s iruit drink. Only
seven would watch the Big
Bear caVurt in the sky.

But alas, even during this
display some of them retreat-
.ed [0 a tent, and oLhers fell
asleep! Was there no one to
divine their message? indeed,
the distant thrub at" a single
guitar raised in song, answer-
ed that there was no one. And
In the past there had been blin-
dreds with voices raised in
aims of praise — in song and
in philosophy. But now, no
one.

Then, it was early morning.
A loyal Saga worker opened
the doors at Cowles at 6:15. He
awaited the exhausted students
of the heavens; no one came.
The stars blinked quickly and
disappeared.

fees for the remainder of the
school year.

The two main factors alfect-
ing the decision will be the in-
crease in board cost for next
semester If the reierendum
passes, and the probable insti-
tution or a checking system,
in me form of 11) cards. to be
presented at each meal.

According to the figures pre-
sented to the Student Affairs
Committee, ii the nineteen-or—so
students who expressed a de-
sire to iorego board should do
so, the increase in fees for re-
maining boarders would be
$5.40 tor the year. (When the
number of boarders decreases,
the decrease in Saga expenses
is not Comparable, so the fee
per remaining boarder must:
increase for the college to meet
its contract with Saga.) The
college would absorb the cost
tor this semester, but next se-
mester each student would be
paying $2.70 more in board.

In addition. some sort of
checking procedure would have
to be enforced. The SAC is
working on other alternatives,
but so far the proposed sys-
tem would be to issue each
student a photo ID card indi‘
eating his board status and re-
quire him to present it at each
meal. The cost of the card per
student would be about $1.50
(or maybe less), and the cost
or empioying checkers would
be about 5.95 per student.
Therefore, the board cost next
semester would jump about
$515 per student.
