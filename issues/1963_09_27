Israeli Ambassador Siresses l

“I'm quite prejudiced in think»

important," said Israeli Ambassa-
dor to the United States Alli-ham
Harman. Harman spoke Sunday
night on “Israel: The Role of a
Sindll Nation in the World To-
clay."

In emphasizing the smallness

speaker said it lud only 2,—

no n' tion is willing to surren-
lilei- i own personality by any
dictate. Another basic principle
or a small nation the ambnss
sador pointed out, is its stake
in international peace and hare
mony.

“Peace is not the absence of
war, It is a positive concept, not
a negative one." in reference to
the present Siluatlon betwe‘an the
Arabs and lsi-aclis, Harman said
that every day which passes in

The ambassador feels that a
small country should not en-

one in quantities, but should
try to keep defense quality on
an equal level. In isracl the
people are less removed from
the government than in a ing-

Harman concluded his spccchl

Widely publi /.ed through all the l‘l‘lld‘
west news media, this is the type of Stile
dcllt action that has an immediate and last,
ing’ effect on tllat nebulous force termed
the “Grinnell image.”

However, is this the type of activity
that we would like to present as charaete
lstic oi‘ the Grinnell student body?

Given the supposed above average in—

telligence alid maturity ol‘ the Grinnell stun ’

dent, do we want the “public to see and
come in contact with this pa ticular small
group of studrnts and ti ouch them colnc

to belive tllat here is a true representation ,

ol‘ the ivllole college”?

Our answer a resounding YES! ’l‘li'
is exactly the l lid of responsible action,
intelligent organ tion, and active concern
for the rights at lnall that we would like
to see become automatically assoc ated with
Grinnell and its student body whenever
they receive public mention,

We applaud the Grinnellians who w 'e
active participants ill this demonst iition
of sympathy and respect for human beings
and their rights and hope that the p: 'tlcu-
lar facet of the “Grinnell Image” which
they have helped to develop will continue
to grow and actually become the core of

Grinnell College and all it represents
D. A. B.

Problems 01‘ Jrhe 'ln Loco Parern’rs' Theory

Oberlin, Carleton, and Grinnell. These
v'ere three ol the schools whose students
took deep, probing locks last year at their
lespectire college rules.

At Carleton the students debated open
rooms, women’s hours, chapel requirements,
and misuse of the student press. At Ober-
'l the emphasis was on open dorms. At
Grinnell women's hou open dorms, the
schola ip repayment rule, the car rule.
'sexnal misconduct, alld the liquor rule were
all debated.

While the pii'ticnlar rules discussed at
these schools varied, the underlying theme
was a deliberate student challenge of the
age old college operating- theory of “in loco
parentis."

Is the college responsible for the stil-
dents in the absence oi" the parents? It' so,
to what degree are they responsible? These
Questions are difficult til answer. While
we'd like to jump in and say, “01" course
‘tiie college shouldn't be responsible for the
actions of each student,” we can’t. We
realize all too well that plessure has been
exerted upon President Bowen to take the
parental responsibilitle. il‘or many students
i.t Grinnelliespecially in the case of par-
ents who send their children to Grinnell
with the understanding. that this institution
will provide a home-like atmosphere and
discipline '

However, there are others. There are
the parents who say, “You’re on your own
now, my boy (or daughterh” And then

these parents send their children off to
Grinnell wllere they are far from on their
own.

Thus the school of thought which preA
scribes to “in loco parentis” is incompatible
with the “student independence" school.

Statingr the problem is easier than stilt-J

ing‘ the resolution. Some of the most vocal
groups on the Grinnell campus believe that
their individual freedoms are being denied
by the present rules, while on the other
hand the most vocal group of parents and
alumni seclll to think Grinnell is turning
into some kind of haven for beatnll
immoral sinners.

This “hole discussion of‘ the incompati-
bil y of the two schools of thought, ill loco
palentis as opposed to complete student in
dependence, has posed a threat to the whole
theory of a residence college. Currently,

Grinnell has students from more than half)

the states and several foreign counties.
If campus discussions are any indication,
these students have failed to .iell illto a
homogeneous society in which the student
from the socially liberal home lives happily
along‘ side his more conservative neighbor.
We feel that if Grinnell is going to at-
tain the spirit of the college community
which ascribes to, it is 'oing to have to
convince its backers that immorality doesn't
start with a couple alone in a student’s
rooln, and that it will have to make more
of a provision [or individual freedom.

Try i‘o Recover Aii‘er Ripon Loss

Injured Pioneers to Meet Knox

By Jim Fish ‘

The Grinnell varsity football
team will lly for its ﬁrst u-inl
oi the season tomorrow as they‘
_ travel to Knox College, Gales-
burg, lll. Grinnell will be out
to avenge their 3470 defeat sut.‘
fel'ed at the hands of Ripon in‘
last Saturday's season opener. l
Grinncll was hit hard by in-‘
juries in this ﬁrst game at Rip—l
on, Offensive tackle Eric Miller;
will be out {or
weeks with a shoulder separa-
tion. Halfbacks Chip Clarke and
Elston Bowers and tackle Pete
Staben suffered sprained knees,
It is doubtful that Bowers andl
Staben will make the trip to,
Galesburg. Clarke will probably
see limited action Other Pine
neers being slowed down by in-
juries are Art Weyrauch and
Denny Homerin.

According to Grinnell Coach
Ed Bowers, “I think we have
been able to correct many or
our mistakes. However, we
still have it long way to go.
Our oifense is still sputtering
anti [ just may make some big
personnel changes to try to

get it started" l ,

According to this plan, a lot
of new faces will be in the
starting lineup tomorrow Sched. :
uled to start in the offensive
backﬁeld are three sophomores:
John Shierliolz and Dave Syn-t:
horst at the halibacks. and Davey
lmes at tullback. Starting attv
quarterback will be veteran ;
Dick Orchard,

Replacing the injured tackle,
Eric Miller will prot bty be
John Montgomery, a 215 pound
sophomore, At the other tackle
will be Rein Saral. At the ends‘
will be Dave Gaugcr and Jim
McKlveen, at the guards, e0»
captains Steve War-rick and
Pete Heinzelinan, and at cen—
ter, Morgan Mrchel.

Mike Dewitt has looked good
at end this week in practice-
and will probably sec action at
ottensive end. Coach Bowers
said that tor the Knox game
he might run DcWiLt at right
end and shiit Jim McKlvcen to
tackle.
