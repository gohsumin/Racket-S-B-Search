Let Us See For Ourselves

Last night a state department interpreter. in an anti,
Castro position. said to a group of students alter the Arrom
lecture, “If you’d go to Cuba, you’d see that things were
bad."

This week a petition printed by the Fair Play For
Cillia Committee, but not officially afi iated with that
group, which has no chapter on campus, is being circulat-
ed among students and faculty.

The petition directed at President Kennedy urges
a re sion in tile state department policy of hostility tor
ward Cuba. It suggests that diplomatic and t Ade relations
be restored and that the Cuban people be permitted to de-
telmine their own destiny without interference irom any
outside sources. More important, but contingent upon its
other prov sions, the petition suggests that the 1; \\'Cl ban
on (‘nba be litted.

The petition does not encourage an Ollt‘mifl-Ollt sanc-.
tion of Castro practices and policies; rather, it snide; s
that it is to eas ' to draw wrong conclusions from an arm
chair hundreds of miles away from the area of contention.
relying only upon ”interpreters" and our “sometimes l'l'ee
pre s.”

if the state department is so convinced that “Castro-
land” is “bad,” Interested students at Grinnell and through-
out the U.S. are only asking ”Won't you let us be truly
American? Won’t you let us see for ourselves?”

Reiier Finds Ceylon Crowds Mysierious, Exciting

By Becl' Reitcr

The downtown area at Colom—
bo is called the Fort The prin—
ciple government buildings and
the large dcpaitnient stores are
locatcd in this area. Most ot the
buildings in the Fori. are not
over two stories tall, The main
streets, although not spacious,
are wide enough to handle trai-
tic ‘

The department stores are
similar to the

almost anything in them, ltluwA
ever, they are not nearly as
luxurious. and the service is
rather slow. Sometimes this
slowness is due to the tact that
the merchandise must be passed
through so many hands,

Even one small package is
handled by three dittercnt peoa‘
ple. First, there is the person
who actually sells the article.
"Even If one is paying cash. he
,must write out a bill of sale.
Then the purchase. thc money,
and the bill are given to another
person who runs off vvith the
lot. He, in turn, gives everything,
to a third person at the exiti
who wraps the package and re-
turns the change.

In addition to this timescon-
suming process 1 have discover»
ed that it is very difficult at‘
times to get the clerks to show
one the dittercnt sizes, colors
and varieties of any panicular,
product. One asks if such and
such a product is available. The
answer may be ”yes,” but that
is the end of the matter A no
attempt is made to show the
product to the customer.

The next question is;r”May
i see it, please?" Then the
customer is shown one exam—
ple. This goes on and on, the i
customer asking to see each

diffenm color and each par- ,walk in the streets, and traffic sea. Between (our and 51x every

tieular size or shape. The solus i

Half of the eginn’s

though only 5 per ccnt of the
land is considered good enough
for agricultural production. De-
spite this, Latin America seems
to be emerging (com a self.

and to'bs headed toward a mod-
ern. much subdued, industrial
revolution.

A vel‘y'important "factor to
consider is the volume and di-
rection of investment. How-

countrics don't have the capac—

tectively because of such fac-

China, paintings and iurntturc
are among the many antiques
‘ieloneind to the collection of
Sam Tctft, Grinnell iunior. For
nany years Teltt has been
browsing through antique shops,‘
going to auctions and visiting
the attics of old homes in search
of pieces to add to his Collection
The fun of the hobby, says Tefll,‘
is “making a,flnd:" for objects
of great interest and beauty can
turn up almost‘ anywhere,

At one backwoods auction in
Vermont, Tefit picked up an old
drop lcal table and a primitive
painting of a milkmaid for (\Vel‘k
ty cents. Another of his pu
chases includes a pan- oi Carth-
agiiiian lamps and an Egyptian
scarab, originally bought in
Tunis by a professor from the
University of Chicago. ‘i

According to Tom, these i
things which have survived 1
(or so many years help to tie l
history together and to pro ide
a link with the past. Unlike
modern {neloryrprmlutcd arti-
cles he added. they have uni- i
one personalities and back-
grounds. i

Tcift's collection includes
many early American pieces
such as samplers, a plate lrom‘
Harvard College and a cherry

cost only $15, but it turned out
to be no bargain when Tom
was obliged to pay $120 for a
mattress to fit it llis tainily has
also inherited some antiques bee
longing to British ancestors who
came to Ame ca and settled in
Boston in 1635. l

One of the good things about

Grinncll has had a poor-
wrestling season by the books,
This year’s varsity mat team
could bring home only the scalps
of Knox and Coe in dual meet
competition and a ninth place
ir. the Conference meet.

But, looking at the season
meet by meet and noting indi-
vidual progress it would be uri—
fair to let the “poor” rating ap-
ply to anything more than sta—
tistics.

At least two men would have
been welcome in the best of
wrestling circles. Dick Harris,
l‘llnnel‘rup at lslepounds last
year as a sophomore in the con.
ference meet, returned this
year to terrorize his opponents
throughout the season. He racked
up eight wins against one loss, a

to the top division of Midwest
conference wrestling.

While failing to win a meet
this year, the yearlings picked
up enough experience, according
to Coach Edd Bowers, to make

them potenlial troublemakers on;

the mats next season.

Jon Larson and Al McKnight,
at 157 and 147 pounds fresh
co-captains, hulwarked the young
mat crew. Larson Carded a 1-1-1

and droupcd one.

Bill Patton, captain of the
Grinnell w estlers, piled up a
