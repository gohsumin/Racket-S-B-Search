A request

A recent memorandum to Grinnell students and facul-
ty from tlle art acquisitions committee closes witll this
1 ragraph:

“With additional purchases and e tended loans of
works of art, the placement of new acquisitions in campus
Buildings \ Il become routille. Because, like ollr temporarv
loan exhibitions, they will be openly displayed, we ask eV-
el‘y member of the campus community to share a feeling
of deep responsibility for their Safety. They are objects
of both material and aesthetic value, and in some cases,
(if g at historic value. All original work of art cannot be
ieplaced."

We can do little more than underline those words and

press deep Concelll and shock at the incident which

prompted the nlelno, alld at a sinll incident which oc-
curred Tuesday.

,Prior to Cllri tmas Vacation. an o .lal John Shirle-
ton Copley Valued at $15,000 was taken from Burling lb»
lal'v where it was being: displayed and hung- in a pl'ecal'io:
position on a campus building.

ar

Tuesday. fine arts staff members rel tell tha‘. ill
an apparent perverted attempt at humor. 21 paper rain-
bow had been taped to the unprotected face of "The
Temptation of St. Anthony," a painting by Max Ernst
which is now on loan to (‘ illnell from tlle New York
Museum of Modern Al'tl

We can find absolutely no justification for such acts.
Anyone who would consider the: “hulllorous” could har ,ly
be said to represent the type of student (‘rrinnell c l claim,
in the overwhelmin; majority, as a member of its com-
rlunity. /

Again we refer to the fine alts acquisitions. commit;
tee's memo in asking; “every member of tile can JllS coin-
rlunity to share a deep feeling of responsibility for the
safety of art works which are and which will be on display
zit Grinnell.

in support of A! Boston

We support Al Boston as a candidate for the Student
Government Association presidency.

It would be untrue to say that he had planned to enter
campaign week with our vote committed. We were waiting
to see ”What the other candidates" would have to say.

But, despite tlle fact that Al is the y alternative
wedon’t feel compelled to support lllmrﬂlltl‘HS, don't feel
lldlculous ill doing so because he's “our only choice.”

In this case, we feel that the quality of the candidate
adequately substitutes for the usual quantity of applicants.

And, if it’ ally consolation to Al, we might point ollt
that his quali cations for office might have been part of
the reason why no one contested him. No one likes to lose.

Al is all extremely capable fellow —— an excellent
speaker and a man with. we think, a practical philosophy
of student government. He has good idea and the qualities
of leadership necessary to see them curlled to the students
of Glinnell. Again, we support Al Boston,

Our post office

We r ally oil 'lt to consider ourselves fortunate. We
do have a post of ce on campus. Of course it’s ill a base,
ment and has only two public entrances, both at the bottom
of narrow open stairways.

And if several persons have fallen on those often ice-
covered steps this winter .lt lei t no one ll} ' been iiliul'ed.

Anyway the ice and snow will soon melt and in two or
three weeks it‘ll even be possible to get our mail without
dashing down through small waterfalls Y s, we certainly
are fortunate to have our own post office.

Now, if we can put a\ ay the acid and write with ink
once more, what we suggest is this: that the college lnake
the best of the post office’s bad location by enclosing the
stairways. This would keep ice from forming (and, if the
enclosures were locked at night, it nlig it even stop those
annual jokesters who fill up the Sir: wells with snow).
in warm weather, the outer door could be removed to
permit e . er access to the stail'niys.

ﬁssion: denial emphasize inquiry

by Al Boston

It is rather evident that there
is some lack of respect and un.
dersiandlng toward student govA
ernmcnt among the Grinnell
College student body. Certainly
the increased pace and workload
of the Student Senate and Exe»
cutive Cabinet has made those
two groups seem somewhat aloof
and unapproachable

i feel that an insuiiicienl
amount of communicatlon be
tween the student body and its
government is causing this lack
of understanding as to what
student government is attemptr
mg to accomplish,

As president of the Student
Government Association i would
try to inform the entire student
body of the activities and pur-
poses of student government
through periodical reports in the
Scarlet and Blue . Further, a
mid-yea col'l'ec hour with the
SGA president and perhaps others
of the Executive Cabinet would
offer he students another op-

ident with ihcn- ideas and crib

say that we have too many. ll
could be argued that we have
heroes but what we need is a

would be an opportunity for our

perhaps It could be earned oul
in the manner of a political elec-
tlon. The candidates could be
chosen by a referendum and
these Candidates could be placed
in various parties: the literary
pally, the pol-rural party, the
entertainment party. etc.

Ideas for campaign posters and
buiions immediately come ti:
mind. The Hemingway buttons,
for example. could read, "What
we need is more gu in our
myths;” Grace Kelly's slogan
could be taken from the title 01
Horantlo Alger’s book, “Strive

Seymour Glass 7 “Knowledge

second thought. that's too long
for a slogan. It would have to

be abbreviated ol' shortened in
order to fit onto a campaign
button.) Calnus‘ slogan could also
be. l-rln not angry: rrn just sud'

Overall, what I would bc
seeking as SGA president is to
determine an efficient. and nat-
ural relationship between the
students and their government.

To the Editor:

We wculd like to make comv
men: on the recent display of
discourtesy and disrepeet shown
by certain inlelduals toward
works of art which Grinnell has
been pl'iV eged to exhibit dur-
ill{; the past few months.

This attitude toward exhibi-
tioils that we are eviremely for-
tunate to have on our campus
does not speak well for the
maturity of Certain pa sons. Re-
gardless of personal ltc or dis-
like, each individual owes a de.
gree of respect to any art work

To the Editor:

The Southern Negro is in the
difficult position of neither hav-
ing equal rights nor the oppor-
tunlty for securing equal rights.
Under the iron hand of white
supremacy, he is forced to
maintain his position. He is re;
slrlcled in many areas, including
the right to vote, attendance at
an integrated school with equal
educational opportunities, and
the freedom of residence,

in trying to gain equal rights
lie may be beaten. imprisoned.
economically boycotted, or per-
seeuted in some other manner.
Yet, most Northern students
stand by, permitting the Negro
to suffer punishment as a mat-
ter of course,

Through our complacent ate
tittlde, we are rendering those
rights guaranteed us by the
Constitution less meaningful to
ourselves and to those who
have a critical eye towards our
democracy. If we tolerate dis.

lminatlon against one minor—
ity group. we will endanger the
rights of all minorities. We lnust
guarantee equal freedoms for
ourselves and for generations to
Come.

There are groups. however,
which stand at the forefront
in helping us to acquire and
maintain democratic ideals.
Among these groups are the
freedom riders. The results
of their struggle, as well as
sit-ins, kneel-ins, Wilde-ins,
etc.. are well worth noilng.
The significance of their at
tempts portrays the highest
ideals of American democracy
— the struggle for the equal-
ity of man, These people are
sacrificing themselves for their
ideals. Yet, the freedom riﬂ-
Ea. for example. face ﬁnes.
imprlsmuncni, and permanent
criminal records which may
mar their futures.

The "Committee of 100," in
support of the NAACP (The Na
tional Association for the Ad.
Vancement of Colored People)
Legal Defense and Educational
Fund, Inc, is defending the 303
freedom riders currently on trial
in Jackson. Mississippi. Legal
expenses for this venture alone
will amount to $75,000. We dc
not have to sacrifice ourselves
to help the freedom riders and
their struggle, but we do have
an obligation to help defend
these people. Contributions to
their cause will be much apprer
cialed. Checks may be made out
to the ”Committee of 100" and
sent to Room 1790, 10 Columbus
Circle, New Yer 19, New York
or. if you desire ,they may be
placed in Box 413,

Here is an opportunity for
students — both conservatives

reciting slogans of human digr

Brechi's 'The Measure Takenl
scheduled for rebroadcas’ring

by Ray Obstfeld

Bertolt Bl'eclit’s play, “The
Measures Taken,” was broad-
cast on Feb. 18, in an adaption
for radio by Samuel Schuman.
The play, ivhich is scheduled for
rebroadcast this Sunday over
KGRN (650 and 680) at 4:30
pm, is both a technical and
dramatic achievement.

it is the story of a young
Communist agitator before the
Chinese revolution who places
her humanistic ideals above the
workings of the party,

As a part of a mission assign-
. ed to foment rebellion, she
finds herself caught in the con-
flict of what she feels is right
as a human being and what the
party expects of her. Her dilem-
ma is in the end a fatal one.

As the hard core Communist.
and in several other smaller-
roles, Ann Fetter delivers an
excellent performance. Her
voice, and in a radio play the
voices assume even more im»
portance than on stage, carries
the ring of cold steel necessary
for the part.

Barbara Breckenridge,‘ as

 

conflict within her movingly
and does complete justice to ll
difficult. role.

Leigh Tracy, as the Contra

Fades’ dilemma, and like
questions which both Clarify the
play and stimulate the listen-

er.

His performance, as one_has
come to expect from him, is a
polished one. Alice Allen and
Mark Ferdinand, as 'the other
two agitators, both turn in com.
petent performances, though I'm
not Sure that Miss Allen’s voice
is entirely suited to the role.

The technical part of the prev
duction is superb. The difficulr
ties of editing. adding musical
background and adjusting voice
level have all been handled ad~
mirably by James Wilcox.

Samuel Schuman's direction
is excellent; he sustains the
movement of the play despite
the fact that it was originally

. meant for stage production.

As a “first” at Gl‘inncll “The

'Three Experimental Plays done with finesse'

by Alvnh Stanley

On Feb 18 and 19 the Gl-ins
nell theater presented “ancc‘
Experimental Plays” in the Hal—
lie Flanagan Arena theater. The
program consisted of three short
plays—Garcie Lorcals “The Love
ot Don Pel'limplm and Delisa in
the Garden,” August Strinde
bergs “The Stranger” and a

alumna,

The plays were done with a'
good deal or imagination and
finesse; the only complaint might
be that the program represents
the only bill of one—act plays

scheduled in the Arena this sear
son.

It has only been Within the
past. few years that the one-act.
has come into its own as a ser—
ious dramatic form. The selecc
tion of the plays presented, and
especially the Lorca, bear out
the claim that the short play is

 

Campus Inquirer

Five Grinnell students werel
asked- What is your feeling an

lbout the fact that there will be

not to be passed over lightly.

“Don Perlimplin" presents
many interesting and exciting
problems both to the interpre—
ter and the audience. Many of
the problems arise from the
fact that the play is more of
a multiwoiced poem than it
is a clearly defined drama.

The effect and power that the
play attains come more from its
vivid imagery and the sheer
beauty of its words than from
the inclusion of the usual dra-
matic functions—character, plot,
and action, it is constructed with
the sort of precision and econo-
my that is more often asomatr
ed with non-dramatic poetic
forms.

The problem for the actor be.
comes one of giving “flesh and
blood” to a construction of po-
etic metaphors, and the prob»
lem of the audience becomes
one of abandoning preconcepr
tions and allowing the play to
operate on its own grounds. in
both instances the problems
were successfully solved.

Miss Petersllie's play presents
‘othel‘ problems. She has wiitten
a vignette which might be sev-
erely critized if judged as a
drama Takcn, however, as the
dramatic presentation of simple
experience—2i moment snatched
from time and held for exam-
ination—it can hold a good deal
.of charm. The play has little or
no action. The production of it
must therefore rest on sharply

defined and sufﬁciently detail-
ed characterization.

It is the simple story or two
particular people who are
thrown into a particular cir—
cumstance. To ask more of the
script would be a mistake,
especially since it succeeds so
well in its own right.

“The Stronger” seems to be
the least praiseworthy of the
plays which were chosen for
production. Although it is an in.
eresting piece for the student
of Strindberg and a worth—while
exercise for the actor. the tale
it has to tell is an old one and
its style is a bit stiff for modern
audiences.

A detailed explanation of
how Grinnell will spend its
ordinary income and gift in-
come in the next three years
was presented by Presidelltl

Howard H. Bowen at a coffee i

hour Monday.

Speaking on “Current De—
velopments at Grinnell," he
outlined to assembled students
and interested persons proposed
budgets for expenditures to be
financed from student fees as
well as the $4 million Ford
Foundation ‘grant ($2 million in
other outside giits, $2 million in
matching funds from Ford)
which was made this {alli

Most impressive development
in terms of cash outlay will be

ning. A total of $4 million will
be required to carry out the
proposed longrrange physical
improvement program.

or this, $1 million will be

in construction of a. Student l

center, another 51 million for

a gymnasium-like recreation
center and $000,000 tor an
addition to the Science build
ing.

Other expenditures in this
area will include $600,000 in
tour installments for dormitory
face—lifting; ' $105,000 for re-
modeling of Carnegie; $70,000
[or the recently completed Barr
her skating plaza; $20,000 for
remodeling of ARH auditorium
and thc old Arena theater; $590,.
000 {or remodeling oi the heat
ing plant.

A second area in which a
dynamic program of develop»
man is planned is "educational
opportunities.” Largest expendir
tures in this area include 3125,—

000 to be Spent through 1064 for:

improvement to library colleen
tions as well as the following
expenditures to be made over
the same period: $40,000 for ad
ditions to art collections; $50 000
for visiting professor salaries;
$150,000 to provide for the ad—
dition of 11 regular staff mem-
bers; $30,000 for student relat-
ed research: $20,000 to bring
six additional foreign students

to Grinncll; $81,000 in speciall

aid for students of low income
families, $13,000 in special aid
icr ioreignservice scholarships.
in addition, the “educational
opportunity fund” provides 325,»
000 to be spent next yeal‘iand
an additional and equal amount
the following year to retain a
string quartet in residence hcrc
.Tlie Leiiox Quartet, which
performed at Grinnell this
fall, has been engaged ior
next year, Bowen said. Ac—
cording to Bowen, the Quartet
will be in actual residence
“more than hall the time" and ‘
will teach, conduct music
seminars and play a number l
at concerts on campus. >

Other areas oi major expendi-
ture include general operating
expenses to which $1,005,000 in
put income will be applied ov-
er this 'and the next two years.
Also from gift income a total

of $312,000 will bc spent throughl

1964 for “strengthening of ad-

ministrative staff and for day
velopment,"

Proposed increases in expend
itures to be financed from regr
illal‘ income (1. e. student fees)
include an increase DI $104,000
in college employee compensacl
tioll for 1962-63 over this year
($1,507,000) and an additional
$110,000 increase over that in
1963764.

Student aid will be boosted
$25,000 next year and all nd~ ,
ditional $25,000 next year to i
help compensate for the in»
«crease in tuition fees.

Completing his presentation oil
the proposed three-year budget,‘
Bowen unveiled a series at
architect’s drawings which ch‘
picted possible locations for the,
new student, center, a rem-ca
tion center, addition to the]
Science Building and field houset

1 (Three alternative building

lschemes now under considers
1tion by Trustees and architects
'are reproduced on pageipur of
illiis issue). ‘

First to be built, Bowen
said, 'is the Student'Center
which will replace the present
Student Union undivhich will
likely be located on the
, present site of that building,
‘ Current plans are, he said. to
break ground for the Center
next spring. '

l
i

Plans for-the Center have not
been finally approved, Bowen
said, and, he pointed out, there
may be some changes made. He
,said that he and the Trustees
are particularly interested in
,obtainihg student opinion to aid
‘in deciding upon a final plan.

Two proposals which clrew
lvarying opinion from students
Monday were the plans which
would have a swimming pool
as part of the student center.
>5ome said they thought the pool
ought to go with the recreation
center, which would be built
near, or as an addition to, Dara
by gym.

1 Bowen indicated that, a larger

campus meeting may be held
in the near future to allow stu-
dents to make their views
heard.

If the Shatt Plan is passed.

Fl'ommelt stated that this
plan, advocated by the con-

and would tend to iiinkc the
