Board Of Trustees To Meet Here;
Two Sessions Open To Student Body

The Board of Trustees will
hold a series of meetings Sat
urday and Sunday with admin*
istrators, faculty members,
and students. Two meetings
Will be open to the student
body at large.

The first will be an informal
meeting Saturday evening in
Younkers Lounge starting at
8. Topics for discussion will
be possibilities for better ins
forming the college commun-
ity of the board's meetings
and actions, and the ad hoc
committee's proposal that the
senior class each year elect
a member to the Board of
Trustees for a two'year term
beginning after graduation.

The second open meetingwill
be Sunday afternoon in the
Forum South Lounge from 3
to 5. Students at thattime may
discuss their role in college
goverance with the trustees.

A number of closedmeetings
Will also be held. The first,
a general meeting Saturday
afternoon, will include the ex-
ecutive council of the faculty,
executive cabinet of SGA, and
the trustees including chair-
man Lawrence G. Keeney. Nu-
merous reports will be pre-
seated at that time, featuring
President Leggett'spreliminr
ary plans for academic reor-
ganization, a report on the
faculty‘s progress in curricu-
lum reform, Dean Walker's
report on finances and the pres
jected tuition increase next
year, and a report from SGA
president Andy Loewi.

Sunday morning the invest-
ment committe and commit
tee on trustees (a selection
committee) will meet. Inaddi-
tion, the remaining trustees

Community Day Is

Moderate Success

Community Day, scheduled
for October 24th, was extend-
ed beyond twenty four hours
because rain forcedpostpone-
ment of the day's activities.
Small groups of townspeople
and college students worked
in the afternoons ofthe follow-
ing week to clean up several
vacant lots. This job included
cutting down trees, removing
garbage and moving heavy de—
bris to the junk yard.

Although much of the enthu-
siasm was lost due to the
weather, most of the jobs, ex-
cept painting houses, did get
done; and public responsewas
favorable. Anne Walter, studs
ent organizer for Community
Day, said, "The momentum
was really squelched by the
weather; but there are great
possibilities for the future.
There is no question that the
public response we got was
favorable."

Possibilities for the future
include a day to be set aside
in the spring to paint houses.

cuss changes in judicialcoun‘
cil organization and proced-
ure and possibilities for ch-
anges in the disruption clause.

Another closed general
meeting will be held from 11
to 12:30 to hear reports from
the investment committee and
committee on trustees. From
2 to 3 the trustees will hold
a closed—door meeting with
Leggett.

Loewi, speaking of the large

number of closed meetings,
expressed the desire that the
first general meeting Saturn
day could have been opened
to the student body. It was
not, he said, because the tr-
ustees would not have recei~

*vved fair notice prior to the

meeting. However, a S&Brct
porter will be admitted to this
and other closed meetings,
and a report will be published
in next week's paper.

Wright Tactics Draw
Attention To Racism -

by Debby McKnight

The mail box blurb announ-
ced: “Nathan Wright, Jr. on
‘Black Power: a Creative For-
ce.’ " and described Wright
as "a vigorous black strate-
gest of blackrwhite confron-
tation.” “Vigorous" was an
understatement. Wright, wh—
ose credentials include his
book about Newark, Ready to
Riot, and chairmanship of the
AfrvAmerican Studies De-
partment at SUNY, Albany,
was on campus November 5.
He spent much timewithblack
students and visited the Amer-
ican Minorities class. An in-
formal public discussion took
place in South Lounge at 4:00.

Before the discussion, Wr—
ight exchanged a few words
with each person in the aud-
ience, creating a kind of bond
that does not usually xist
between students and vi 'ting
speaker.

Inmates Rap About Prison Life,-
Say Men Treated Like Animals

by Bill Knecht

Three inmates and a super
visor from the Riverview Ree
lease Center near Newton sp-
ent Wednesday afternoon at
Grinnell discussingprison life
and the American penal sys-
tem.

The three men, Barry Mc-
Daniel, Alvin J. Willis, Ch»
arles Willey, and theirsuper-
visor, Sam Moore, spent the
afternoon in discussion with
faculty and students, first in
Loose Hall Lounge at 2:15and
finally, in the South Lounge at
4:15.

Their discussion began with
dieir experiences as inmates
of various corrective institu-
tions, especially Riverview,
where they becameacquainted
with one another. Riverview,
they explained, is a "buffer"
between hardrcore penal in-
stitutions and the outside
world. It provides a place for
convicts to adjust to the pres-
sures and tensions of every»
day lifettsmall things to most
people, but forces strong ent
ough to drive some men to re
turn to the “security" that
prison can offer. Since they
are not usually allowed to re
turn, they must commit new
crimes to be readmitted.

The men expressed theirbe-
lief that therearea greatnume
ber of criminals who would
truly like to assume a normal
role in society, and who could
benefit greatly from an instit
tution like Riverview. They
cited their own experiences in
penitentiaries, wheremen we-
re treated “like animals,"
and were not given the coun-
seling and individual attention
they feel is necessary to es-
tablish true rehabilitation.
They explained how a convict
in a hard- core institution is
likely to drift into a “dream
world" of fantasy in which he
does not have to work for a
living, or accept the blame for
his mistakes, or seek to pro
vide for his own security, or
accept any of the responsibie
lities a healthy member of
society must accept in order
to adjust to that society.

They elaborated that Rivera
view has extensive facilities
to aid inmates in reorienting
their goals and behavior. Psy-
chological therapy sessions
enable individuals to see their
problems more clearly and
to help them to be able to es-
tablish healthy relations with
other people. Individual couri-
seling helps inmates toasscss
their capabilities and to

Search for healthy goals to
suStain them on the outside.
Job training gives them skills
to enable them to support th-
emselves. Frequent opportun-
ities for social contact, such
as Wednesday-night skating
in town, and frequent visits to
friends and families, enable
them to interact on a normal,
everyday plane with people

students have to say about
things here at Grinnell Col-
lege . . . What are some of
the tings thatneed to be done?"
An immediate suggestion was
to have more black people.

Taking this up, Wright cone
tended that the "marginal op»
inion" - that of groups denied
full participation ina society-
is more sensitive to that soc-
iety. From here he stressed
the need for black faculty mes
mbers. ”To omit 15% of the
American experience is to
preclude any chance of find-
ing the truth about it." He.
then said that black recruit-
ers are necessary for finding
creative black instructors who
will not serve as “window
dressing” for a college inter-
ested only in "being white."

Convincedthat he "couldne-
ver have gotten a job at any
major university if it had not
been for black student pro-
test,” Wright put some hope
for changes in America.
racism on the efforts ofyoung
people. First he demandedthe
recognition: ”Everybody in
America has apro-white mind
. . . a black man knows he is
honkified as everyone else but
he tries to overcome it, know-
ing it's not in his or the white
people's interest." However,
white Amerim refuses to ad-
mit its own racism, and this
refusal prevents dealing with
the problem. Before the two
races can get together many-
thing, Wright contended that
white people mustunite among
themselves to begin corrects
ing their own attitudes. .

The discussion content was
not new; the ﬂamboyant con-
frontation tactic was. Wright
commanded the attention of
everyone in his audience; wh-
atever the opinion of his phil-
osophy and style. The even-
ing address at Herrick Chapel
was similar. A large crowd
gathered to hearWright “bear
down very hard on white peo-
ple."

Denouncing civil rights leg-
islation, Wright claimed that
in the last fifteen years, the
black American's positionhas
actually deteriorated. He at-
tributed this to the inherent-
ly conservative role of social
institutions such as colleges.
Society does not allow them to
exist except to preserve the
status quo. Since the Ameri-
can status out) is white sup-
remacy, institutions general-
ly further racism. However,
Wright did not rule out all
possibility of change. Anyone
who wills human fulﬁllment
will just have to work at un-
dercutting the “dehumanizing
effects of institutions."

ReligiousGuru Raps to GrinneH

by Mark Subleman

When a caravan of more than
thirty brightly and variously
decorated busses and cars
and of more than two hundred
brightly and variously dressed
people came to Grinnell last
Tuesday, many Grinnellians
wondered what it was allabout.

If they stayed to inquire or
went that night to Derby gym,
they learned that it was all
about a religious guru from
San Francisco namedStephen,
who had a philosophy that was
all about unified fields, and
telepathy, and being together,
and energy of attention, and
the third eye, and drugs, and
tripping, and non violence.

Stephen, a tall, slender man
of 35, who entered what he
mlled ”the guru business"
almost five years ago, is lea»
ding two hundred of his most
devoted followers on a trip H
with all puns intended -- ace
ross the country and back, a
trip which he hopes will bring
him and his flock new exper—
iences and insights, and bring
his message to new people as
well.

First stop on the trip, after
the caravan left San Francisco
“with untold tons of dope,"
was Sublimity, Oregon. After
the caravan crossed the bor-
der, and Oregon state police
“relieved" the members of
their drugs, Stephen went on
to Sublimity and his speaking
engagement there.

Neither he nor anyone else
in the group was arrested at
that encounter, however; and
Stephen attributed this, and
the “excellent" relations they
have had all along with local
officials to the group‘s Striv-
ing for good relationships with
others. Stephen teaches his
followers (0 be friendly and
strive for “good vibrations"
with everyone, for he believes
that in any endeavor, “you get
out of it exactly what you put
intn it -- as you sow, so shall

you reap."

Much of Stephen's teaching
is, like this, strangely tradi*
tional, or from traditionalor-
igins. There is, he told the
audience in Darby, "no ex-
cuse for being violent -- Thou
shalt n0t kill. lfa lot ofpeople
just act peaceful, they can
make peace come.”

Stephen’s own theology is,
in fact, a curious blend oftra-
ditional ideas, Western and
Eastern, secular and religir
ous, as well as a few newer
ideas of Stephen's own. He
considers his Zen master,
Suzuki Roshi, and the writings
of Aldous Huxley to be two of
the biggest inﬂuences on him.

Christian influences arealso
apparent in Stephen: he told
his audience of almost five
hundred people in Grinnell
that ”Christianity has not
been tried and found wanting;
it has been tried and found
difficult." He attributed the
decline of Christianity and
other religions in the past to
“materialism, the profit mo-
tive, and formal education."

But apparently materialism
and formal education have not
been entirely successful. Ste-
phen said Tuesday afternoon
that there are now signs ofthe
beginning of a large spiritual
revival. San Francisco, he
said, is the “guru capital of
the world," and in recent
years there has been a steady
increase in the number of
gurus, and in the diversity of
their international origins.

This religious revival and
increase, Stephen believes, is
the result of a return to the
”vibratory disciplines”, or
those which deal with opening
up people’s minds, especially
telepathically. They are con-
cerned with opening up the in-
dividual's "third eye" by whs
ich he perceives other minds
and understands new insights
about the world.

Stephen believes that drugs
are very helpful in the process

"SENATOR CHARLES 'Three's-arcrowd' Percy says

number of income tax exemptions for children to two,
because what with the population explosion and the

Senate Comes To life
Finishes Old Business

by Don Dagenais

Because of the late appear“
ance of the 5&B this year,
there has been a decided lack
of coverage ofStudent Govern?
ment Association activities
this fall. Yes, Virginia, there
is an SGA (despite widespread
student belief to the contrary),
and furthermore it is alive
and kicking. The mainprob-
lem, however, has been that
its activities are not easily
visible to the student bodyand
therefore are vastly under
appreciated.

Many students have been
justifiably driven from the
Senate meetings because of
the Senate's preoccupation
with mundane bureaucratic
matters. Students are begin-
ning to feel that the major
point of interest in the Senate
meetings so far has been that
Greg Vranicar has hada ch-
ance to show off his ﬂoppy
old black felt hat. But take our
word for it, Fall Senate actir
vity is usually not so drab.
Last year's early closing nes
cessitated the postponement
until now of such business as
the interviewing and appoint
ing of committee members,
approving the budget, etc.

Fortunately, these tasks are
now in their final stages of
completion, and SGA Presis

about the “relevancy" of his
topic (he thinks it is), Feaver
proceeded to paint a picture
of the Greek society which
thought of music not as an
element of entertainment, but
as a basic component of the
life of the intellectual. Music,
in the opinion of the Greeks,
is net only a means ofexpress
sing the emotions, but is a
method of molding emotions,
therefore shaping the charac

dent Loewi guarantees that
future meetings will deal with
topics of more universal ins
terest. Discussions of such
subjects as the financial sit—
uation of the college, possible
calendar changes (the poten‘
riality of a 4—1-4 scheduling,
etc.), the Group Independent
ideas of Henry Scheff (pre-
sented in an earlier 5&8),
changes in the grading sys-
tem, townrgown relations,
and, of course, the Great
Faculty Requirements Debate,
are in the works.

Increased student particlpar
tion will, of course, be a key
factor in the success or fail-
ure of such discussions. It is
tactfully suggested that stud-
ents reread thatlast sentence.

The Student Coordinator’s
office has been far from inac-
tive. Greg Vranimr, Student
Coordinator, has the duties of
being a campus ombudsman,
a "troubleshooter" of sorts
who acts as a link between
faculty and administration and
students in solving problems
of all sorts. He has done a
tremendous amount ofworkso
far this year in the develop-
ment of the Committee Apro-
posals calling for increased
student participation in the

Velvet Underground Getting Better With Age

by Chris Decker

Opinions about the Velvet
Underground tend to be scat‘
tered: “Black Romantics"
(Time); "Latent lmagists"
(Ernie Lundquist); or inconr
sequential: “Aging darlings
of the avantrgarde" (Rolling
Stone.) It is even possible to
get the impression that John
Gale and Lou Reed are pri-
marily interested in scaring
sixteensyear- old girls.
However, the Velvet Under-
ground have shown themsel-
ves to be much more inter-
esting than that. Their first
album is held together by a
thematic obsession with dualr
ism and chance. “BlackAngel
Death Song" is the clearest
presentation of the concepts:
the Black Angel and Lou Reed
play dice, with Reed’s life at
stake. Underlying the scene
are religious references and

After a first selfrconscious
burSt of terror, the album
becomes too remote and pre-

customary inevitability; "All

rong hints of “lawns of

The Marble Index.

tains little new material. The
title song sounds like ”I'm

”lady Godiva‘s Qweration"

impact of "Lady Godiva” is
‘in the vocal arrangement:
Reed interrupts Cale‘s lead
in a strident tone which fore-
shadows the doubles tra ck narr
rative of the third album's
”Murder Mystery." "SiSter
Ray" is held back by 3 mon-
otonous concern with fellatio,
but it introduces several mo-
tifs which appear in a more
mature form in the third ale

use of stuttering, though this
technique is unfortunately not

The third album is curiously
relaxing. In a way, everysong
on the album is an attempt to
explain the change which took
place between White Light/
White Heat and this one. On
side one, this comes through
in the organization; on side
two, in the content.

Side one is about love. It is
intractably Cartesian inspir
rit, progressing from the dis-
enchantment with the flesh of
“Candy Says":

“I‘m Set Free" and “Story

trained than the first cut.
They are similar in atmosphr

"Murder Mystery" is anas-
tonishing piece of self-parody.
There is some interesting
conceptual trickery centering
around the words “obverse,
converse, reverse, perverse,
inverse." The general effect
of this technique is a vague
impression thatmirrors, Pla-
tonic Forms, and Edward Al~
bee are involved in a curious
ly banal kind of conspiracy to
mystify the listener. The last
few minutes of the track are
the best: two narratives are

their work extremely well:
Cale, ”Winter Song" on Nico's

to do with thealbum other than
writing the songs. Reed sums

previous meeting as a prog—
ram representing a consensus
of divisional interests and of
many of the numerous propo-
sals offered since the faculty's
first meeting of August 28. It
'provided for the substitution
of a freshman tutorial prog-
ram in the initial semester
for course requirements for
graduation. Included also was
a hcultycstudent Freshman
Year Committee to pass on
tutorial curricula.

’l-Iowever, last Monday's
meeting was entirely devoted
to consideration of amendme—
nts to the proposal offered by
Luther Erickson as 3 ”Sci-
ence Division Response to the
Freshman Tutorial Progc
ram."

The Science Division feltthat
it would discourage their par
ticipation in the program ,1“.
less:

1) tutorials were offered both
semesters of the freshman
year; and

Mears Dears Fall,

The Mears Dears have struck
back. Have you seen the Quad
bulletin board lately’.7 Well the
sign is gone but the thought is
still there. Liberation, my fr-
iends, in the form of sexual
interplay for fun and profit.
Get the picture? Orwhatever?

Mears, other than Phil, has
been lmown for its sweetsugar
coating for several years on
this campus. No longer, dear
customers. The first sign on
second floor reads, "Pay here

A blow for freedom. Not really
but it is really a nice way to
make money if that‘s your
thing; Perversions a little
higher. I haven't been ableﬁto
check into the profit aspect of
this enterprise as ofthis date,
but money isn't everything.
Besides, l-laines has proved
that there must be something
to it, since they have started
an equal butopposite business,

‘ Where are the days of the

Mears song ayinst “demon
rum"? Gone, alas. Thank God
for small favors.

2) tutorials could be tied to
courses offered by the Divi-
sion. (This is described asa
”4 - 4 operation.") It was
objected that if the tutorial
program were of value as de-
vised, much of itsmeritwould
come from being offered im-
mediately to entering fresh-
man in their first semeSter- ,
preparing them for course'
planning and independent re
search later on. Ric McDow—
ell spoke to this point atsome
length, citing his experimen-
tal Humanities section last
year, and arguing thatexperi-
mental and tutorial programs
are best offered early to fr~
eshmen.

Peter Bowman pointed out
that the second section of the

Erickson proposalwoultl leave
one section of the 4 - 4 under
departmental control, with the
other section responsible to
the Freshman Year Commit-
tee.

There followed a great deal
of rather perplexing debate
as to whether tutors should
also act asprincipaladvisers,
whether the Freshman Year
Committee should be of three
faculty and three students,
three and two, or two and two
(and if so, why?) etc.

The upshot was that the face
ulty voted to have a two-sem-
ester tutorial offering, not
tied to courses already offer-
ed, with tutors as principle

For Biting Commentary

by J. C. Labowitz

Dale Hawn called me the
other day and asked me to
sound out opinionaroundcam-
pus about his pet ultimatium -
to wit, that all pets found in
dorms after the mid-sem br—
eak would be taken down to the
veterinarian's and put to
sleep. This action was evic
dcntly necessitated by the
maid staff, which has been
complaining about the anic
mals' pop bottles, pizza box-
es and other messes that they
have been leaving around.

I decided to get a truly reps
resentative sampling of opin-
ion by asking a few ofthe came
pus pets themselves, since
they seemed most directly in
volved. I started with Caine

Tederman, but ran into a lot .

of problems because he did

Woman’s Lib Slicrh‘ers Labels,
Explains Chauvinism--Sexism

by Andrea Frey

In talking with those involved
in Women's Liberation on car
mpus, l was able to dispense
with many of the misconcep-
tions that had previously en-
couraged me to avoid the mo
vement. Any organization's
activities should include ac-
tion centered on recruitment
of new members, and it is
unfortunate that the comma
tions that have been attached
to Women's Liberation by the
American people and media
have forced us into a misin-
terpretation of the movement
and its goals. For this rea-
son, many women have been
discouraged from allying th-
emselves with the structure
altogether.

Since the onset of what the
media has labeled the New
Morality, the word ”libera-
tion" has attracted manysex
ual connotations. Because of
this, many people assume that
Women's Liberationwill make
women easier objects for men
to overcome sexually. Wom-
en's Liberation has also been
referred to asan "anticmale"
movement. Although they
voice grievances concerning
how they feel they have been
treated by males as a group,
WL by no means advocates
a hatred for the members of
the male sex en masse.

Two words appear consists
ently in WL literature and sp-
eeches. Even though I didn‘t
know the exact definitions of
the words "chauvinist" and
“sexism", I thought that I
was aware of their meanings
simply because I could use
them in grammatically sound
sentences. The women I talked
to defined a chauviniSt as a
male accustomed, either con-

sciously or unconsciously, to
manipulating women by definc
ing his own role as superior
to that of a woman. They cxe
plained sexism as an attitude
which supports an interpreta-
tion of roles as differentiated
by sex. After understanding
the connotations of these
words, I realized that sexual

Freudianism is not what Lib-
eration is about. Muchlike the
word “liberation", the word
"sexism” lends itself tomis-
conceptions.

The deceptive qualities [have
described are causes of the
mediocre turnout at the WL
meetings on this campus. A
few of the fifteen women pree
sent at the meeting [attended
felt that the lack of mass par-
ticipation was due to an inabi~
lity of new members to relate
to the older ones. Women's
Liberation does n0t merely
entail the need for day care
centers and abortion clinics,
although these things are both
in the forefront of the Wells
publicized WL demands. Wo-
men‘s Liberation also means
intimate discussion of female
sexual andpsychologimlgrie-
vances. Many of those new to
WL apparently find some of
the older members unrccep-
tive to their need for an al-
most therapeutic exchange of
ideas. Therefore, they feel
that they can bestsatisfy their
needs elsewhere.

The movement is at present
hoping to fill these gaps. Dor-
mitory discussion groups are
being formed. It is hoped that
within these groups, women
new to the movement will be
able to communicate their dis-
content concerning their de-
signated roles as females. The
Women's Liberation Confer"
ence will take place November

13 , 15. The campus WLgroup
has invited several women
from outside me college com-
munity who are lmowledgable
in topics relevant to Women's
Liberation to Stage a panel
discussion. In addition, there
are two Women's Liberation
group independents on campus
in which members read and
discuss books like Sexual Poe
litics and The Second Sex.

any questions, and besides
that he was wearinga football
helmet. I did ask his mother
what she thought, and she was
all in favor of anything that
would put Came to sleepahout
10 o'clock every night.

I then encountered Gaylord,
the small black and white dog
of undetermined heritage who
frequents die Grinnell cam'
pus. He was more than happy
to discuss the situation with
me, but he would only meet
me in a place that would be
secluded so that we wouldn't
be overseen by B and G. I
suggested Cowles cafeteria at
lunch, so we met in the lobby,
and walked on in after Gay-
lord gave the checker Eric
Hines' meal wrdnumber, with
nothing being noticed out of
place. I then queried Gaylord
about the pet situation over
hot dogs. I asked first about
the threat to take pets down'
town and put them to sleep.
Gaylord fired back, “1 don't

‘ see that as a genuine threat.

I have spent a lot of time
around ARH, and I can tellyou
for a fact that you don't have
to take me downtown to put
me to sleep. All the guys down
at the hydrantagreewithme,"
he added with finality.

I then inquired about his liv~
ing arrangements around
campus. I recalled that Gay-
lord and Iliad been neighbors
when he was rooming with
Alex Karlin in North Pit.
“This year I have a real nice
room' in a girl's dorm on
North Campus. I did spend
some time over in White House
and German House, but what .
I am really waiting to see is
Dog House”, Gaylord reveal-
ed as we went up to SAGA
Martha for seconds. Gaylord
went with the pigs-in-a- blan‘
ket this time. Gaylord then
apologized fornothavingmore
time, but he was due at a
Pets Emancipation Thrust
(PE 1") meeting, where he was
bringing up a proposal for the
health center staff to include
a full-time veterinarian. He

ging tail.

ored downtown, making them
less accessible to the stud-
ents. According to Christian-

The main function ofthe Libc
rary Committee is to assist
the librarian with policy mak-
ing, make recommendations to
the President and Dean on lib-
rary needs and policy, and
plan the book budget with the
librarian.

Committee members are Phr
ilip Kintner(chairman), Henry
Alden, Robert Christiansen,
Donald Irving, Gerald La-
londe, Carolyn Ashbaugh, 13*
nda Camilli and Curtis Scrib-
ner.

Thus far the committee has
approved the total bookbudget
of $33,000 for the present fisr
cal year. This amount shows
a 15% increase overlastyear.
When asked for the reason for
this increase, Mr. Chrisrianc
sen said, “Some people felt
that expenditures for books
were inadequate."

The committee also set the
agenda for the year. Qie ma-
jor concern will be the sapce
shortage in the library caused
by the administration offices.
Because of this shortage,
older periodicals are new St’

sen, the problem increases
yearly because of the growing
administration staff. He comc
mented, "They usurped one of
the seminar rooms this fall."

Other topics discussed will
be the periodical bank and
the problem of items disapc
pearing from the collections.

THE SCARLET AND BLACK.

Snow White And 7 Freaks To Open

Experimental Children’s Th-
eatre is alive and well at
Grinnell College and plans to
come out of hiding during7:00
p.m. performances November
is and 14 and during a 2:00
matinee performance the 14th
in the Arena theatre. After
making its great debut at Gr-
innell the theatre group will
make a once-insarlifetime
tour of area elementary Sch
0015. The totally improvised
script is entitled only Snow
White because Snow White and
the Seven Dwarfs is a copy-
righted title, but is based on
that famous andbelovedstory.

No script was provided the
actors and the entire play was
written by the cast members
themselves as they went ale
ong, having only an idea of
the basic story to guide them.

DANCERS in the delightful plat

The success of the play, then,
depends solely on the ingen-
uity and creativity of the see
tors. These ingenious and
creative thespians are Vicki

Lofquist, Jamie Rosenblatt,
Greg Gaines, Jule Kagsn, Jack
Gay, Jane Freidson, Karen
Auerbach, Phyllis Ganser
Deni Deutsch, Richard Smith,
and Ron Ai. Included in the
illustrious cast are four dan-
cers, Elizabeth Copeland,
Marilyn Musscr, Mary Ellen
Farrant, and Deb Sanden, wht
ose original choreography re-
flects the various moods ofthe
play as the plot unwinds.

The cast is given a helping
hand by Don Boros, new man
in Grinnell's theatre depart-
ment, and assistant Claire

Rosenbusch. Last but surely
not least (as they say) is the

v 1,. 5

role of Jim Spell. Heprovides
a onerman band, but not an
everyday runrof‘the-mill
one-man band: he uses house
hold objects such as pots and
pans, and Other things that
would be familiar to the chil*
dren, to create his own spe~
cial brand of music.

The purpose of this type of
experimental theatre (besides
entertainment, of course) is
to familiarize the actors, as
well as theaudience,withwhat
is involved in the process of
theatre. The actors experi-
ment with various phases of
theatre and in this way learn
more about what makes thea-
tre “tick." Except for the old
basic story, the play is en*
tirely original and will be a
brand new ”Grinnell experi—
ence."

Brown Warns Thot Pollution Affects Climate

green house effect is uncer-

On November 5, Dr. TheoV
dore Brown of the University
of Illinois delivered the lace
me, "People Who Live in
Gas Houses." A mixed group
of faculty and students heard
Brown discuss three ways that
air pollution influences clir
mate. These were theaddition
of infrared absorbants and
particulate matter to the at-
mosphere, the effect of ins
creased energy consumption
and the subsequent addition of
heat to the environment.

The first area he explored
was that of changing the at’
mosphere’s absorption of
infrared energy. The sun
emits energy of a relatively
short wavelength which read-
ily permeates theatmosphere.
This energy is “bounced off"
the earth back to the atmos~
phere where the principle abs
sorbers of it are water and
carbon dioxide. The amountof
carbon dioxide in the ﬂimOS’
phere is particularly import-
ant in determining its ability
to absorb heat. This is known
as the green house effect.
The present extent of the

pain. It appears responsible
for no more than two-tenths
of a degree temperature m,

crease at the most. However,

as we burn more fossil fuels,
adding more carbon dioxide,

the absorption of heat will in-
crease. By the year 2050, we

will have used most of our

known supplies of fossilfuels.

Their burning will have doub-

led the amount of carbon dice

xide in the air. About 60% of

the carbon dioxide will be

quickly absorbed by the sure

face of the oceans, but the
rest will stay in the atmos~

phere for as long as fourhun-

dred years. This carbon dior

xide will‘absorb infrared rays
and prevent their radiation

into space, thus heating the
surface of the earth by about
four degrees. Theresultmight
be to melt the polar ice caps

and raise the level of the CC,

eans. Additionally, the amount

of precipitation in the northern
hemisphere will probably def

crease. Othcrlesspredictable
effects might also occur.

The second area Erown con-
sidered was the effect of larr

ger amounts of particulate
matter in the air. This matter
could decrease the solar rad-
iation reaching the earth and
produce a drop in temper
ature. Again it is difficult to
interpret present data, but tir
ere is evidence that the cool*
ing phenomenon will occur in
the future.

Finally, Brown discussed cl-
imate changes due to energy
consumption. All energy used
on earth eventually becomes
heat added to the environment.
While the heat currently pro
duced is negligible, in the
future areas of concentrated
population, using nuclear ens
ergy, could put outa signifi»
cant amount of heat.

Brown suggested the definite
need for increased research
in the area of energy gener-
ation. All presently known ims
provements in nuclear energy
still leave the problem of th-
ermal pollution. In the future
we may be forced to limit the
consumption of energy. Brown
concluded with the hope that
research in the near future
would nullify all his glumpres
dictions for 2050.

There will be a Hayride and Campfire Friday night,
weather permitting, from 7:30 to 11:30. The cost is

Religion Committee Reports

Last year a Religious Acti-
vities committee was set up
by Dean Wall,under the chair-
manship of James Fudge, to
make recommendations to the
administration baded on a re-
view of campus religious ac
tivities. The other faculty mes
mbers on the committee are
Dennis Haas and Al Jones.
The representatives from the
student body are Ken Labor
witz, a senior, Floyd Slotter'
back, a junior, and Lisa Wentz,
a sophomore.

The committee has continued
meeting this year to finalize
their planned recommenda~
tions to the administration.
There are two points onwhich
the committee is in agree-
ment. The first is the neces-
sity of an interdisciplinary
major in religion. This major
would include Eastern religi-
ons, the Jewish religion, and
other religions as well as the
Christian religion. This major
would be set up so as to meet
the needs of the broadestbase
of students possible, and not
just a group believing in one
basic faith. The second point
is that of the need for some
type of religious services.
The committee has found that
there are enough students on
campus who feel a need for
chapel services to warrant
their continuation. Dennis
Haas, the college chaplain,
has and will continue to offer
a wide variety of religious
services which are designed
to appeal to as many people
as possible. These are desig-
ned not only for the Christian,
but for those ofdifferent faiths
as well. The Religious Acti-
vities committee felt that it
was necessary to appeal to
those of other faiths because
die campus does include peo-
Dle nfall faiths. The commit-

tee has decided that some form
of religious activity is neces»
sary, but has been wrestling
with the problem ofhow to best
serve all Students with these
activities.

Some time within the next
few weeks the committee plans
to present their findings to the
administration; what the ad»
ministration will do with d1em
cannot be said at this time.
The committee, though, is 31.
most done with its assigned
work.

CBS Proposal Asks
Block Studios Moior

One of the major activities
of the Concerned Black Stud-
ents this year will be to try to
establish a Black Studies ma-
jor, comparable to the Amer-
ican Studies major now offer-
ed.

According to Booker Garter,
president, they are investigas
ting the possibility ofrecruit-
ing black professors and dis-
cussing the criteria of such a
major.

The CBS is also sponsoring
the Avi Ailey mncers,ablack
dance troupe. in February.

They are trying to recruit
more black students here and
encouraging the administra'
tion to waive certain scholas»
tic requirements and accept
more students from the hard
core, ghettus.

A library of black literature,
located in the Black Cultural
House, is being assembled.
The material will be open to
the campus when the library
is completed.

In the future, the CBS will
have rap sessions with the
college community and show
films concerning black cul‘
ture.

Elton John And Sly Reviewed

by Ron Medvin

This column begins what I
hope will be a weekly series
reviewing new recordalbums.
My comments will be short,
and obviously, the reviews will
not be professional. lam just
trying to give my opinions of
some of the music beingmade
today.

A name which is being menr
tioned more and more these
days is that of Elton John. His
second album (Elton John“
Uni73090) is being played on,
FM stations across the counr
try, and he even (unfortunate-
ly) has made it to the AM air-
waves with his song entitled,
“Your Song." In England, Eli
ton John is the biggestattrac-
tion of the year, and he should
catch on soon in the States as
more people hear his only Am-
erican album.

There is no doubt about it;
his album is worth listening
to . . . many times. In songs
like “Take Me to the Pilot"
and ”BorderSong”hispo\Verr
ful voice will overwhelm you,
in spite of the orchestration
which sometimes seems to try
to cover him up. “Sixty Years
On" and “The King is Dead",
however, use the orchestra to
Elton‘s advantage as it pro-
vides a beautiful background
to his excellent singing. And
“Your Song" is probably the
most beautiful and poeticsong

heard In a long while. Elton's
voice easily adapts to the in-
timate style of the song, and
die lyrics (written by Bernie
Taupin) are excellent.

Elton John deserves all the
praise he is getting. Ifyouare
wondering why, get a hold of
his album; you will be getting
one of the year's best.

An album released just a
short while ago will no doubt
sell well, and for good reason.
The album is Sly it The Fam-
ily Stone: Greatest Hits (Epic
KESO325) and contains ev-
ery one of their great songs.
”Dance to the Music", “IWant
to Take You Higher" and
“Stand" still are powerful
songs with the driving Stone
beat. Sly’s vocals are of
course excellent, and the rest
of the group matches his vibe
rant style. The instrumentas
tion is also of high qualit '
there is no resisting the mu-
sic of the Family Stone. This
is definately an album for
“fans" of Sly . . . and if you
missed him in Chicago, this
album is a worthy substitute!
(He was great in New York!)

If you have any comments or
criticisms - (or if you want
me to review a specific al-
bum) , please let me know by
writing to Box 717 or write to
the 58:8 office. Also, don't
forget the appearance ofEnoch
Smokey on the 14th; they’ll
be playing at 9:00 in Derby.

in prison.

Unfortunately, they had to
admit that Riverview is a uni'
que institution. Apparently,no
such Others of Riverview‘s
quality exist in the country.
The men felt this a terrible
injustice to others not so for
tunate as they, who have no
chance to readjust before be
ing thrust into society. They
pointed out that quite a bit of
social change occurs when a
man is behind bars for 25,10,
or even 2 years. They figured
that this was a large factor
contributing to multiple-
crime convictions, statingthat
about 42% of men who have
spent long periods of time in
hard- core institutions return
to criminal activities, while
only about 4-10% of those re-
leased after six months or
more of readjustment at Riv-
erview commit future crimes.

When asked what they felt
should be done about stateand
federal penal practices, they
agreed that more release cen-
ters such as Riverview should
be built. McDaniel felt that,
eventually, most penitentiar-
ies should be phased out in
favor of the release center
approach. He believed that
penalties for first-offenders
should be increased, to ena
able them to reevaluate them~
selves and to make use of the
counseling services which wo—
uld be made available to them.
He continued with a proposal
to increase second-offense
sentences, to serve as incen-
tive for firstroffenders to
reorient themselves the first
time, rather than slowly, after
many convictions, or never at
all;

When asked if they were at
all bitter about what society
had done to them, they ans-
wered “No," to a man. They
agreed that they had felt bit—
terness at first, but that, as
time had gone on, their atti»
tudes had changed toward th~
eir captors. They felt that
time had softened their bit-
terness and had replaced it
with a determination to ad-
just to the society they had
left. They were grateful for

Mogee Describes Stay In Ethiopia

"Ethiopia is a fascinating
place, but it is a very closed
society; they keep foreigners
at a distance,” saidDr. James
Magee, Grinneil's resident
expert on African economic
cooperation. "Its government
is very similar to the feudal
societies of Europe in the 14th
and 15th centuries; although
they do have lightbulbs and
modern weaponry and such,
the structure of the economy
is very backward." Magee,
who is also an Associate Pro»
fessor of Political Science
here, was describing his ex
periences in Ethiopia during
the first six months of 1969.
For the past year and a half,
Magee has been on leave from
Grinnell, the first semester
on an ACM noanestcrn study
grant, the last year on a sab-
batital.

His first six months were
spent in Ethiopia doing re*
search at the headquarters of
the U.N. Economic Commis
sion for Africa. His arrivalin
late January ofl969 fortunater

ly occurred during the tenth
anniversary session of the
Economic Commission. As a
result Magee found the visit
a "very exciting"experience,
since the convention was con-
cerned directly with his own
specific area of interest.

His last year of leave was
spent at New York and at Fri
inceton, where he studied the
nature of the problem inmore
detail and also did research
at the United Nations.

economies is that they do not
have sufficiently large markv
ets to justify the construction
of large firms which could take
advantage of economies ofch
ale. The creation of anecono~
mic union between countries,
accompanied with the break-
ing down of tariff barriers,
would expand the market in
order that such factories could
be built, thus helping Africa
to climb out of the depths of
their present situation, which
he describes as that of “sub
sistence peasant economies."

He sees the chance of formr
ing such a union, however, as
being very small. Newlyrinr
dependent nations are “jeal-
ous of their sovereignty" and
suspicious of each other. Sm-
all countries tend to feel that
the larger countries (such as
Nigeria) would dominate such
a union, while larger countries
out of spite tend to boycott
the idea. Such suspicions pre-
vent any real progress when
the bargaining gets down to
such details as the location of
the factories.

Magee sees the nature of Af-
rican politics as basically
”unsettled." The military has
within the past ten years he

political force than in thepast.

He has also been involved in
ironing out the rough spots in
the Judicial Council proposal,
organizing the town clean-up
project, politicing for student
interests in the Great Faculty
Requirements Debate, and
generally managing to operate
the office with ”greater ef-
ficiency" (in Loewi‘s words)
than ever before. Studcntsare
encouraged to take advantage
of the service offered. There
are rumors to the effect that
an award is being offered to
the first student who comes
up with a problem Vranimr
can't solve.

Bill Thomas and Mary Broo-
ner of CHP’AWS have been
active in mostoftheprcviousr
ly mentioned activitiesas well
as conducting a series of dis-
cussions in each dorm with
the RA, SAs and House Pre-
sident. Thomas reports that
the meetings have been suc-
cessful in pinpointing and ane
alyzing dorm problems and in
developing ideas for dorm
activities. The discussions,
currently going on, are sch-
eduled for completion next

week.

The SGA cabinet officers
have also been conductingdin-
ner meetings with non-SGA
students in an attempt to dis-
cover whatproblems thereare
in communication between
SGA and the student body, and
other difficulties on the cam-
pus as well. This is some

thing of an experiment, since
student government has in the
past tended toavoid close con-
tact with the students themr
selves. So for nothing catas-
trophic has happened, how»
ever, and Loewi reports that
the meetings will be contin-
ued.

would like to see the college
set up a Birth Control Clinic

Women's Liberation in Grin-

He has taken Lsd more than

him a long time to be able to

that "they are not random",
and do contain a message.
Now, Stephen discourages the

ves that ”if you take acid

ough to work with, and you
can not continually expect
”miracle" experiences from
the universe. He encourages

“Getting there by walking",
or “being stoned spiritually"
is basic to Stephen's whole
theology; being stoned is
really getting your mind into
a state where it can communi-
cate telepathimlly with other
minds, including God's.

Communication of minds is
really, at least in theory, the
ultimate experience to Stephen
and his followers. Communi-
cation, or the direction of hu—
man attention on anyone or
anything is “human energy,"
and the only thing that can ‘
cause the greatest satisfac-
tion to the individual and can
cause good things ,_ “things
mat prosper" -- to happen
on earth. To help out the na—
ture of the universe , which,
incidentally is God, since Ste-
phen is a pantheist - all one
needs to do is decide with his
free will to apply hisattention
to a problem.

Stephen and his troupe left
Grinnell last Tuesday night,
and headed for Iowa City, Mi-
chigan, Ohio, and the East
Coast. They will return to
California early next year,
there to settle down into a
commune in the San FranciSr
co area, and to continue to
feel vibrations, to get stoned,
and to create human energy
through human attention.

Soccer Record Drops To 3-4-1;
Tries To Even Season Saturday

Since last word in this pub-
lication, the stars of the sec
cer field have been something
less than brilliant. They have
dropped two contests,andma-
naged only to tie their better
rival Knox. The final game of
the season is tomorrow when
the Pioneers travel to Drake.

The Knox game, played Oct-
ober 24th here in Grinnell,
ended in a 1’1 tie, with both
goals being scored in the first
half. Levi Wood put Grinnell
ahead with a sh0t from the
right wing, but all too soon
Knox tied the game up. Grin-
nell had another opportunity
when Tony Wheeler seeming-
ly scored for the Pioneers,
but it was brought back for a
foul against Knox. It was one
of many questionable calls on
the part of the referee.

The next week Grinnell hada
problem finding a goalie for
their game during Mid-Sem
Break at Cornell. Both regu-
lar goalies, Dave Coron and
Dave Klaus had gone East for
the weekend. After a little
searching Coach Fisher gave
6'7" at football punter Bruce
Rollins a tryout, and immed»
iately signed him toa big bonus
contract. Despite a fine eff
fort by all concerned, the Pi-
oneers lost a cold contest to
the Rams, 3—2. Grinnell's
goals were scored by Tom
Lincoln, on an excellent dir-
ect kick from about thirty
yards out, and Craig Gordon,
on a pass to Steve Korstad
that the Cornell fullback ins

tercepted and kicked into the

Cornell net.

Grinnell was shut out for the
second time this season last
weekend by Carleton, 3-0. Co-
ron and Klaus returnedtoplay
wing and halfback as Rollins
was recruited from the swim-
ming pool to play goalie again.
Grinnell had many opportuni-
ties, but just couldn’t seem to
put the ball into the goal. Car-
leton was a bit ragged too,
but still managed three goals.
Carleton’s record is now 7»l,
while the Pioneers will be try-
ing to make a .500 season out
of it against Drake tomorrow,
as their current record is
3-4-1. Soccerates

Gridders lose To Ripon, St. Olaf

Black days have fallen upon
Grinnell’s Pioneers since last
I wrote of their deeds. Over
the mid-semester break, the
offense reverted to form and
failed to move the ball with
any consistency as Grinnell
lost to Ripon 17-13. Then,
last Saturday, the defense fol-
lowed the offense as Grinnell
was crushed by St. Olaf 35’7.
Grinnell is now 4-3 in league
play (5-3 over all).

Against Ripon Grinnell’s de-
fense repeatedly gave the ball
to Gorgeous Gary Johnsonand
the offense in good field posi-
tion. Key defensive plays were
provided by ‘Mafia Jim’ Plr‘
olli, who filled a contract on'
a Redman fumble at the Ripon
Si, by Randy "the Neck"Sar-
ver, who picked off an errant

pass and ran it back to the
Ripon 17, and by a balding
Gary Jones, who jumped on
a Ripon fumble at their 38.
Only on the first fumble was
the offense able to capitolize,
however. Washington “Baby
Full" AlSton and Henry "the
Flash" Corona moved the ball
to the one, from where the
Flash eased in for the TD.
With the interception, Grin-
nell reached a fourth and goal
from the three and went for
six instead of a field goal(and
failed, as happened a second
time, at the end ofa long drr
ive), and with the second fum-
ble, Grinnell fumbled right
back. Two more scoring at—
tempts (both through the air)
were intercepted in, or near,
the endzone. Grinnell‘s only

IM Program Knocked

IM Volleyball appears to be
following the trend of IM spa
orts this year, as nobody but
a couple of "jock“ oriented
halls are even interested in
competing. The league is again
dominated by the gallant men
of Read, the Clark Creatins,
and the "soul squad” from
North. At the present there
are two surprises in the first
division, the Loose “loviies”
and the suave Smithies.

Games seem to be suffering
from poor officiating, as the
heads of the 1M program have
passed the buck to the halls
to supply adequate monitors.
The big queStion on the ruling
seems to be if the ball hits on
the inside of the line, is it in
or out’! And how over is over
the net? It seems only to be
when you draw blood in some
cases that you get called. Who
said this was not a contact
sport? It seems to be that the
lack of interest is because the
people in charge do not give a
damn. They get paid for an IM
badminton tourney even if no
one shows up. The amount is
reported to be $100 a major
sport, $50 a minor sport. Is
anyone getting their money's
worth? That is, besides Read,
who leads the Truesdale Tran
phy Race with 860 points, Cl-
ark with 760 points, andNorth
with 720 points?

There have been 17 forfeits

by the end of the second week
of Volleyball. There just is
too much of a hastle in lM’s.
There is not that much fun in
playing a team that has blood
in their eyes. Nobody cares
whether you show up or not,
so why bother? Little Rich-

ard, Curly Craig, and the 003'

ching staff get paid reyrdr

less of your patronage. If so-

mething gets done before IM
basketball season it will have'
to be by the halls. Perhaps a

hand food for thought: scrap

have identity teams; forget the

Truesdale Trophy and just

play for fun, like true gentle-

IM program heads who would

work for less, and pay refers

ees more if they were certi-

fied.

As we have changed the hall
system, we must change lM’s
to fit the new Grinnellattitude
and style. It's your turn to do
something. The paperwouldbe

and will be glad to express

your sentiments.

the American Revolutionaries
of 1776 who, in spite of their
lack of discipline and profeSn
sionalism, defeated the Brit-
ish. Coming out on the field
looking like the ‘team' had
just been formed five minutes
before the game, Grinnellpre-
sented a sharp contrast to the
Iowa State team in their neat
little blue tunics. ISU looked
very professional until they
got out on the field. Grinnell
dominated the game and the
final score was 4’0.
Unfortunately Grinnell's luck
did not hold. They lost the
second game to University of
Iowa by a score of 076. The
third and fourth games were
played on November 7 in that
yearly fiasco known as the
Iowa State Hockey Tournar
ment from which Grinnell re-
turned two years ago as State
Champions. First Grinnell
was matched with Graceland
and was defeated 0-4. Next
they played Iowa University.
After a good fight they were
defeated by a score of 1-3.
Before I close, I think there
seems to be a general trend
here that deserves attention.
A few years ago, all the
'teams' that Grinnell played
were more accurately classi-
fied as interest groups who
practiced two or three times
a week and played for fun.
However, now most of the
teams are teams in the sense
that they are composed most-
ly of P.E. majors, they prac
tice every day, and they are
out for blood. I'mafraid Grin—
nell's triumphant hockey days
are over. Unfortunately Ihave
to predict many more seasons
as bad or worse than this one.

far-out fourth. Grinnell's I23
tally played fourth fiddle to
St. Olaf's 42, Eeloit's 64, and

Carlton's 68. St. Olaf was not-

pushed too hard as theyplaced
four of their top five runners
in the top ten finishers.

Grinnell's top scurrier was
Eric Jahn who finished 6th
despite a stomach cramp he
gOt after 1.5 miles of the four

“Hairgod”l "The Mantis

The consensus at the Monday

that mid-semester break was
too much for the team. Any-
way, the team was surprised
at their inability and it was
stated that if the team would
have run as well as they did
at Cornell, they would have
won. Well Coach 0, since you

other score came on a one
yard slam by the Baby Bull.
Ripon scored on a deflected
pass reception by Steve Schn
midt, a 20 yard field goal,
and a onevyard dive by Jim
Beisner.

Against St. Olaf, Grinnell was
destroyed by Ole Gunderson,
a pretty good runningbackwho
gained 155 of the 312 yards
St. Olaf got on the ground,and
by St. Olaf’s quarterback,
Doug Johnson.

Grinnell scored first, going
70 yards in 14 plays, with the
Baby Bull punching over from
the two. From then on it was
all down hill. Gunderson broke
loose for scoring jaunts of 48
and 35 yards to put St. Olaf
up at the half 1477.

In the second half, it was
more of the same. St. Olaf
opened the second half with a
78 yard drive in llplays, cul-
minated by QB Johnson’s boots
leg from the five. A four yard
punt gave St. Olaf the ball on
the Pioneer 22, and Johnson
eventually bootleggedinagain,
this time from “18.12. The
score now stood at 28—7. In-
sult was added to injury when,
with 90 seconds left in the
game, an interception of a
G.G. pass gave the ball to St.
Olaf on the Pioneers’ 21, and
secondsstring QB, Al Montr
gomery, drove his team in,
scoring himself from two
yards out.

The final game ofthis season
is against Knox, at Knox. It
appears as though the Pion-
eers are sinking to the level
to which the experts Predicts
ed. Even though it means a
three game losing streak, it
is good that Grinnell sched-
uled the good teams for the
end of the season, for this
way, one can hope at the be
ginning of the season. For the
Pioneers to schedule the class
at the beginning would be like
reading the last chapter ofa
murder mystery first.
